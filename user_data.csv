S1NCL41R,"Here is what I don’t get with this advice.  With the Roth he “could” lose money over the year.   There is no chance of that with the high interest savings.  

If the Roth lost 10%, he’d end up getting 450 a year.  If he leaves it in a high interest savings there is no chance of that outcome. "
S1NCL41R,"from a financial standpoint, buy an older honda or toyota with a solid service record. around 100K miles is good, you can reliably pull another 100K+ out of it.  


considering where you live, how does parking fit into your budget?"
S1NCL41R,"Correct.  The point is that he can’t take benefit of any gain other than the increase itself over the year.  It doesn’t increase his 10 years of payments.   

So it’s either 5350 + 5000 if the market makes 7% but also possibly 4500 + 4500 of the market drops 10%

Or it’s 5100 + 5000 guaranteed of it goes into the 2% savings account.  

After the year he can put the money in the Roth or any other market vehicle going forward.  It’s only the next year that matters. 

So it’s a delta of 250 IF the market goes up that comes with risk.

S1NCL41R,"might i suggest that a key to this problem actually starts with your attitude   


signing off with ""y'all prolly dont want me here"" and expressing that we are victims of circumstance is a defeatist approach.   the key to winning at this, is to believe you can.   then its starting with a budget.   know where the money is coming from, and going to, and we can help you work from there.  
  

the mantra should be ""if its to be, its up to me"" or my personal fave ""weather you believe you can, or believe you cant, you are probably right""

S1NCL41R,"kudos and best of luck with striking out on your own.  


time to start working on your budget.

S1NCL41R,"why do you believe she's autistic?  


these bad decisions arent your responsibility, nor are they your moms, enabling someone isnt helping them, its investing in the problem.  


if you want to take in the kids, that may be a great solution thats helping and in the right place  


if your sister is truly ill, then have her evaluated by a physician, help her apply for disability, and you still may want to take some level of custody of the kids, because at some point, relatively soon, they will outpace mom and will need real guidance. "
S1NCL41R,"?   You are forecasting an expected upside of 7% for the year?   Which is of course possible but there is risk there.   In this case his future benefit is measured based on how much he keeps.   He gets no benefit (other than the 7%) in the growth as they capped it at 500/year going forward.   So if he made the 7% he would get $350 for the year and the 500 x 10 for a total of $5350

If he lost 10% over the same period he would end up with $4500.  

If he put in the 2% vehicle he would have $5100 and no risk.  

So the delta is $250 and risk.  "

S1NCL41R,"Nobody here is qualified to define whose money the survivor benefit is.  We know that survivor benefits were paid to spouses and children but have no real visibility into how the money was treated post distribution.  Is it in trust? What are the terms of that trust?   

We don’t know how it was invested.  Could be in an annuity which is paying off x% which is where the 1500 comes from.   Could be in something else.   We don’t know, nor do we know who owns that vehicle.  

Finally the one thing we do know is that the money from your ex may not meet the threshold of dependent (which I believe is 51%) and therefore the one thing that seems clear is he could not claim the child.   Either the 1500 is yours or your mothers or some other legal definition and half that money exceeds 51% of the child care meaning your ex can not claim the child.  

You have a lot to research legally.  If it’s indeed your money, legally and being administered by your mother outside of some defined trust then you should be given control of it.   Though based on your decision making that concerns me.  

If it’s not and the money is sitting where it should legally, then enjoy the benefit of guaranteed income, hopefully leveraging that to do something fulfilling with your life."
[deleted],"To clarify a bit more on why people say only pay into 401k up to the match and then go Roth IRA:  it's because IRA has more flexibility.  You can withdraw principal cash (not the growth) penalty and tax free if you ever get super screwed by an emergency. You can also choose to invest in stocks, mutual funds, ETFs and a lot more as opposed to a 401k.  Pay into the 401(ks) up to the match - both you and your wife - then both of you max out Roth IRAs in each of your names ($6k each).  After that, contribute left over money to 401(k) and keep working your way up the 401k savings rates until you both max out.  

Also, you may want to think about diversifying your tax liability.  That's a strategy that's always overlooked.  Think about a traditional 401k and a Roth IRA to help diversify your tax liabilities in the future.  "
[deleted],"Multiple credit cards, should I close accounts? Hello, I had pretty bad credit and I have been rebuilding it over the last several years. When I started this journey I could only get one of those cards that you have to put your own money down first and that is your limit, and now I can be approved for cards with limits like $5000. 

&amp;#x200B;

Hypothetically let's say that I had 3 high-interest low benefit cards carrying a $0 balance, and 2 mid-low interest cards with benefits like airline points that I use for emergency/purchases. I am not concerned about % of credit used because I will keep it at or under 20%, but I am unclear how the age of my accounts works. Would closing some or all of the 3 lower cards hurt my credit?"
lilfunky1,"&gt; I think the biggest thing that is killing the 'extra' $1000 per month is that my job requires me to drive to many places so I 1. Eat on the go a lot and 2. End up paying $200+ a week in gas and refueling every other day at times. 

1. buy a personal sized cooler and pack a lunch &amp; snacks to keep in your car with an ice pack.
2. your job isn't reimbursing you for your fuel when you have to drive everywhere for your work?  why not?"
lilfunky1,"&gt; I also don't think I've realized how babied I am :). When I lived with family, I was always taken care by my family. When I lived with roommates (that were my friends) or my boyfriend (now my ex), they would take care of me when I'm sick or like little things like that. Right now, I don't have much friends here, so having that good relationship is up in the air. 

if you think random roommates are going to baby you when you're feeling sick or just feeling lazy, then you'll be in for a shocking surprise."
lilfunky1,"&gt; this is the same person who used to own a multi million dollar business if you can believe it.

i'll believe it.

just because you were wildly successful 50-60+ years ago doesn't mean you have any idea of how the world works today."
lilfunky1,"&gt;I want to buy a car for around 20k but dont wanna do monthly payments with interest due to my religion. Is it possible to lease a car for 3 yrs then buy it out right at the end of the lease when the value of the car is lower?

Leases are still monthly payments with interest.

And it's extremely rare to have a lease on a used car."
lilfunky1,"&gt; That's... exactly what I'm gonna do?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; That's why I have to wait until I'm 21, because it's gonna take me 3 years.

ah, i thought you were waiting until you were 21 to be considered a mature student so a high school graduation wouldn't have been necessary to attend university."
lilfunky1,"&gt;I doubt an unsecured loan from a bank will be cheaper than a cc, though a cc is an unsecured loan. This guy is just starting out, he doesnt have that many good options and a cc is pretty straightforward.

Personal loans are usually 8%-15%?

Credit cards are usually 20%-29.99%?"
lilfunky1,"&gt; Fair enough, but I've never met someone who said they were really glad they weren't home and lost someone. Point being that there is more to life than money. Just an opinion.

is OP losing someone close to them in the near future?  i don't remember reading that in the original post."
lilfunky1,"&gt; I figured I could speak to an agent instead of doing it online. I guess the agent would probably just enter my info into the same form I would have filled out anyway. I just don't know if they have any influence on the approval.

They don't.

Usually if you get rejected, you get a phone# to call for them to re-consider.  But I still don't think the person on the phone has any influence.  They're just inputing more data that you called."
lilfunky1,"&gt; The cc payments stopped when the automatic deductions started.


if the credit card payments stopped happening when the auto-payments started coming out of your pay cheque... you've still been paying the correct amount for access to the gym, so what's the fuss?

"
lilfunky1,"&gt; Yeah that's not really the question, but rather what are chances them perusing this with them being a small business?

The chances are completely up to the owner of the shop and how much they care about their $1200.

&gt; I guess it's semantics but at this point the bike was stolen out of my garage and my renters insurance also refuses to cover it

**You** having **""your""** bike stolen out of **your** garage and **your** insurance refusing to reimburse you for a bike **you never paid for to begin with** is ****NOT**** the bike-shops problem.

&gt; Like I said in the end I don't mind paying for the bike but I clearly didn't get the bike I saw online so, if the vendor wanted me to pay at some sort of discount I would gladly do that since that is the only thing I can do since I no longer have possession of the bike to send back

You took too long to check out the bike.  If you received the bike in January and opened up the box within a reasonable amount of time after receiving it and put in a claim at that time, instead of months later, you'd have a better leg to stand on."
letsreset,"your thinking is correct. if your employer offers 3% without needing you to contribute, then i would aim to max my roth IRA first before contributing to 401k.

&amp;#x200B;

what to do with leftover money? personally, i would put that extra 5500 to my 401k instead of dumping into next year's roth IRA. every year that you don't max out your tax advantages, is time and opportunity to contribute that you can never get back. if you can manage to save 11,500 this year, then you should be able to do it in 2020 as well right?"
letsreset,"well, better that you learned this lesson now while you still have a few decades in front of you to continue saving. some people learn this when they're ready to retire and wonder where their money will be coming from. 

as for what to say to your creditors, the last thing they want you to do is to file for bankruptcy. they may recoup some of their money, but definitely not all of it. first, i'd do research on declaring bankruptcy so you understand the basics inside and out. then when you talk to the creditors, explain that you're getting ready to file for bankruptcy but was wanted to call to see if an arrangement can be made before pulling the trigger. hopefully, it encourages them to work with you rather than lose it all when you file for bankruptcy. also, you make enough money to handle this debt. i don't think you should file for bankruptcy as it will make it even more difficult for you in the long run. "
letsreset,"i took a personal finance course at the local community college. one of my favorite classes ever. super casual and just talked about stuff i was interested in. and yes, the teachers were there basically advertising their services, but they were fee-only advisers who required at least 500k in assets for them to manage (so basically 500k not including property). the information they gave was extremely helpful and well, pretty much matched up with the Prime Directive - but went more in-depth about different investment vehicles, how the different investments would react to market changes, and things like that. basically, i'd be very interested in taking that class again. 

&amp;#x200B;

i've also been sold mutual funds in the past. that was a mistake. 5+% fees. holy shit i got fucked over. "
letsreset,"the real estate agent and mortgage broker do NOT have your personal financial interest in mind. they are heavily biased and want to sell you a mortgage/house. obviously they will encourage you to do whatever it takes to make that happen. taking money out of your 401k before you are retired is just a bad idea. as the other poster said, continue saving up money until you have 20% of the down to buy the house. your 401k savings is in a great spot. do not go backwards on it!"
letsreset,"if your cc is maxed, i'm assuming you're not paying off the balance in full each month. therefore, your credit score is going to start dropping regardless. thinking about your credit score and number of cc's in your current situation isn't prioritizing properly. the first priority for you should be to get yourself out of this hole (debt) asap. as others have said, a 0% balance transfer card would be a good idea. "
letsreset,"try not to overthink it. first, figure out how much money you're going to be bringing home. it will be much less than 70k because of taxes. let's pretend your take-home is 48k, or 4k/month. next, list out all your expenses. rent, gas, fun, insurance, food, etc. all this added together MUST be less than 4k/month, and ideally is under 3k/month so you have wiggle room and the ability to save money. 

&amp;#x200B;

that's pretty much it. just keeping track of the money coming in and going out, then making sure that you don't spend more than you have money coming in. the lower you can keep your expenses, the more money you can save and the faster you'll be able to be financially independent. "
letsreset,"the purpose of working is to earn money so that you can enjoy life and be happy. you earn enough that moving out is reasonable, but as you stated, that would be 40-50k/year difference. that's huge. if i were in your position, i would stay with my parents until the debt is paid off, then move into the city. you'll be much for financially relaxed and be able to enjoy all that the city has to offer. moving out right now will drastically slow down your debt payments. "
letsreset,"keep in mind that credit score is essentially a rating of how trustworthy you are that you'll pay back the money you owe. having a great score means you're very trustworthy (in the eyes of lenders), but doesn't say anything about your financial standing. currently, you don't have enough saved up to buy a house, making credit score irrelevant. while you continue to build your credit score, make sure you continue to save so that you'll have a large amount of savings and a strong credit score when you're finally ready to buy. "
letsreset,"i mean, it seems like you're fairly organized, you know your income, your expenses, and your debts and the interest rate associated with each debt. i also didn't see a single question in your post or comment. what is it exactly  that you'd like people to be analyzing? "
letsreset,"that's a common thought. but when you pay rent, you're paying for a roof over your head and somewhere to sleep at night. you have the ability to move, you're not responsible to pay for the upkeep of the yard or if any major issues happen like the fridge breaking, a pipe bursting, etc. rent is also the most you're paying each month while mortgage is the least you pay each month. in january, i forked over 2k because my sofa-couch in my rental unit broke. i paid \~$200 to get a locksmith out because my battery driven door lock ran out of batteries. about half a year ago, i paid \~4.5k for a new fireplace/furnace that heats the condo. i'm planning to spend another 3k this summer to replace the carpets. that's the cost of ownership, and you're just not in a position to take on those costs just yet. eventually, yes, but not yet! be patient, and don't look at your finance's boss, who has a financial incentive in you buying a house, to be giving you financial advice. "
letsreset,"i make about 5x as much as you do and drive an older and cheaper car. i get the itch to buy something new and fancy, but you're spending WAY outside of your means. you can continue to argue with everyone here telling you it's a bad decision, but ultimately, you're in control of your own life. if i need a new car, i'd probably look at a car from around 2013-2016 and aim to spend maybe 6k on the low end, and maybe 12k on the high end - and this is for me. if you want to continue paying down debt, never retire, and live paycheck to paycheck, well, step 1 is buying a new car you can't afford. and you're just about to take that step. "
letsreset,"eh, the more you post, the more up and down votes you're going to get. don't let it bother you. 

&amp;#x200B;

but your score is already above 750 which will pretty much get you the best rates. your focus now should be doing what makes the most financial sense and stop focusing on the credit score."
letsreset,"worst case scenario:

she doesn't pay, it's now you and your husband's debt. they're student loans, so they cannot be defaulted out of. so if she just flat out refuses to pay, you could potentially be stuck with the entire loan. 

&amp;#x200B;

will it affect you? if she doesn't make payments, then absolutely it will affect you. how could it not? "
letsreset,"imo, this is what got you into 25k debt. you're going to continue finding things that you 'need.' if you have neck and shoulder problems, figure out where it's coming from. maybe a simple pillow will do the trick. maybe it's another issue altogether. but spending another $800-$1000 on a mattress isn't going to magically make your neck/shoulders better and you'll just be digging a deeper hole. "
letsreset,"i disagree - when you buy property with the intent to rent to be cash flow positive, then yes, what you stated is true. however, the math does not work out that way in HCOL areas. i live in the bay area, and i recently saw a report that the average house here is now \~1.8 million. the rent in this area, while expensive as fuck, would NOT even cover mortgage in the large majority of situations. "
letsreset,"i would absolutely do it. imagine if you're offered a 30k raise. as much as you like your current situation, this would at least allow you to:

1. research your new life situation if you took that offer - with 30k more, it's safe to say that you'd be able to save up for retirement more quickly, live in a more desirable area, etc.
2. at least just say hey boss, i received an offer for 30k more than i'm making right now. i love my situation here, but 30k is a lot of money and i'm not sure what i want to do. i'd like to talk about a raise, as that would make my decision a lot easier. "
letsreset,"well no fucking wonder you're doing well! if you have data and hard numbers that supports that claim, that's a real easy sell. i can see why you're itching to jump into it full-time. have you thought about hiring a full-time employee to take on your work? essentially, you would be transferring your risk to the employee. the timeline can be moved up much faster if all goes well. if it doesn't, then at least you're still working your government job. "
letsreset,"i think part of the issue is comparing with others and wanting to 'keep up.' downsizing is much more preferable than barely keeping afloat with a larger house. there are plenty of people out there driving nice cars and living in big houses who simply cannot afford to do so. but you wouldn't know it. if the financially intelligent move is to downsize, then it's a great move to make. "
letsreset,"no problem, that was a very rough 2 minute off the cuff 'email.' make sure you make yours sound professional and try to tie in some things about their company that you really enjoyed. make them want to win your services over the other company. for example, instead of 'i want to stay in the area,' it might be like, i really enjoy that your company has a culture of playing soccer together after work and would therefore rather work at your company. but 7k is 7k. that's kind of the message you want to send. "
letsreset,"well, if you know for sure that a new mattress will solve the problem, then go for it. it just kind of sounded to me like you were hoping a new mattress would solve your neck and shoulder issues. but it's also definitely time to tackle your consumer debt unless your retirement plan is to sell your other house to fund your retirement. "
letsreset,"at age 16, i would recommend you ask your parents to help you set up a roth IRA. then buy some S&amp;P500 index funds. that'll really set you off in the right direction. 

&amp;#x200B;

next, you should continue to focus on saving and spending less money than you bring in. look through this sub and you'll see plenty of people with major debt issues because they spent more than they make. even people making 100k+/year run into major spending problems. when it comes to your car, try to spend the least you can to get a reliable car that gets you from point a to point b. the car ultimately is a necessity in our society, but takes away from your net worth. the less you can throw away, the better."
letsreset,"yes, your decisions are smart and respectable. your line of thinking is also correct that if you gave your dad money, it's now money that can be taken away by his creditors and/or business partners. additionally, he's not even listening to your very sensible advice and is financially suffering for it. if he got into this situation from your bad advice, that's one thing. but he refused to listen to you, got into this bad situation due in part because he didn't listen to you, and now is asking for money to bail him out? hell no. "
letsreset,"that sounds crazy. i feel like they should have at least had some gauge of where the 'invested' amount should be. if you're off by a few hundred or thousand, fine. but i can see people missing the mark by tens of thousands easily. "
letsreset,"that interest rate is lower than the savings rate in a HYSA. keep paying the minimum, and build up your e-fund. i totally understand the feeling of wanting to get rid of your debt. but because your interest rate is so low, from a pure math perspective, it's in your best interest to make minimum payments when the interest rate is 1.99. if you pay it off because you just want it gone, it's not like some horrible mistake either. you're doing just fine."
letsreset,"awesome. i think your first goal while in college should be to graduate debt free. if you can manage that, your high income will put you on a fantastic path when you graduate. a secondary goal i would recommend is to max your Roth IRA if you're able to. contributing at such a young age can really set you up well for retirement. 

that said, by far, the most important thing is to do well in college. this represents your future earning potential, so if you're ever in the position where you only have time to study for a test or go in to work, you study for the test. good luck! sounds like you're headed for success and a comfortable financial future. "
jlevin860,"look up bogleheads. at your age, you really only need two funds, VTSAX/VGTSX (vanguard total us market, vanguard total international) 
i would do a 75-25% ratio, maybe 80/20 if you wanna go more conservative. (so 80k into VTSAX/20k VGTSX for example)

just doing that will set you ahead of vast majority.  put 10k-15k in, 12k/3k in the two funds for example. then each month you can set automatic additions, and steadily add 1-2k a month between the two funds.



disclosure:the funds i mentioned have 10k minimums, you could do VTI/VXUS which are exactly the same funds from vanguard that don't have a minimum but you can't set up automatic contributions, you will manually have to login in each time to add more money."
jlevin860,"yea you are not unreasonable.  if you have listened to his show you know ppl call in who make 120k and have 100k just in car loans. i think he tries to talk to this lowest common denominator listener.
 he just tries to make a point of you have to be focused and you can't lolligag through paying off debt.
i hate that he recommends turning off the matching on a 401k being an investment guy. but the psychology behind it makes sense.

"
jlevin860,"ah gotcha. yea not for everyone!
i do the same thing except with schwab. big investments there, cash parked at CIT. small chase account for rental incomes and credit cards. 

if fidelity made their credit card with no FOREX fees i'd consider them."
jlevin860,"buy a duplex (like 2 apartments attached together) or something with multiple units and rent out the others. you will live in one of the units at first (maybe only for a few months if you don't need to live there and are doing it for investment purposes) and then most likely rent it out. you are not buying this as your ""forever"" home or anything. it is an income property.

i just bought a 4 unit property in phoenix for 18k down, purchase price was 355k. the mortgage is like 2230$ every month, and i charge 750 in rent for each place. so i break even just renting out three of the places, i'll make an extra 750$ if i rent out the last unit.

imagine you bought two of these. (which after your first one should take less than two years to stack up another 18k)

now you have 6k in passive income coming in. yes you have a mortgage but eventually it will be paid off. you think in 30 years you won't get 8-10k of rent from 8 apartments? now you have 95-120k income every year (minus property taxes/insurance so maybe minus 9k for that).

this is not including any social security, 401k, roth ira, or any other investments.

so you could do NOTHING else investment wise and still have a six figure retirement income.

i bought my first house at 24, i was dumb for not buying more and i was dumb for buying a single family home as my first investment, not a 2-4 unit.

i recommend 4 units because that is the biggest you can go with a 30 year fixed rate loan(which is what you want, most ppl use these to buy their homes)

a 6 unit property will require a commercial loan and you want to avoid that. way different requirements and rates.

i still max my 401k/roth ira/HSA, but combine that with some rental real estate and you have to really REALLY fail at everything to not retire a millionaire or at least with a six figure income in retirement."
jlevin860,"ah ok. i figured you werent that far into the churning game. i have 35-40 cards and same credit limits... if you didn't mess up bad at this stage then i guess you could try it.  


if thats the case. sign up for bank sign up bonuses once you build up the cash. like discover bank just gave me an offer for 150$ on 15k for basically a month. thats 12% a year. citi bank, chase... they all have these offers. and its all fdic insured. something to consider.
"
jlevin860,"you need to talk to a cpa and see the cost basis. depending on the amounts you don't want to start liquidating all these stocks at once and generating huge capital gains tax bill.

you actually would only use tax managed in a non-ira account. it basically tries to generate as little taxes each year. mutual funds are not as tax efficient as an etf index fund though. i wouldn't buy a mutual fund in a non ira account, except possibly a vanguard index fund.

what are the dollar amounts we are talking about if you don't mind me asking? you could put the money in a dividend index fund thats considered more conservative than a general market index fund and be good."
jlevin860,"you are in the middle of a trade settlement. the cash has left your account and they are settling the trade. no, you haven't lost your money, its just the way the accounting works when you purchased the funds. this is normal =) give it a day or two once the investment shows up.
"
jlevin860,"travelling around the world essentially for free. ive been to 25 or so countries on 5 continents.
i know how to make mortgage payments on my credit cards and i have rentals so if you can put 6-8k a month of payments through a credit card you can hit bonuses pretty quickly.

also. i set alerts on all cards to text or email me on any transaction over 1$ (or whatever the lowest number choice they give me) never had a major fraud issue that went unnoticed. "
jlevin860,"i would. i would pay off debt first to free up cash flow and consider rental real estate. thats been the best wealth builder starting off from what ive seen and done.

imagining getting a 800k asset and you only put 40k down of your own money. if the property goes up 5% in a year you just doubled your money in 12 months."
jlevin860,"there should be a tab that says trade mutual funds. there should also be a tab that says trade stocks/etfs. you are gonna be buying mutual funds. notice how FSKAX is 5 digits long? all mutual funds are 5 digits long.

if you see something like AAPL (for apple computers) or T (for at&amp;t ) or VTI(vanguard total market etf)

anything 1-4 digits is gonna be a stock or etf(which trades like a stock)"
jlevin860,"he isn't talking about an RV. a mobile home like a manufactured trailer that sits on a fixed location. you don't hook it up to a pickup truck and tow it away.

and its a terrible investment. they don't go up in value. just rent cheap and keep saving."

if its a decent amount of cash i would deposit at different banks for new money bonuses. i use CIT for my leftover cash that isn't sitting at banks that i'm earning a bonus at. i'm getting 4-16% on FDIC insured accounts. (citi bank had an offer last month was bring 15k for 60 days and get 400$. thats a 16% annual return on a savings account) chase was offering 250$ on 25k for 90 days which is 4%. deals like that."

Tjf331,"I’ve known about the importance of budgeting for a long time and just never had the patience for it. I’d budget my bills but spend every other penny. Got on track with paying off all debt, but still didn’t have cash. Taking out a higher amount I’d need for groceries and lunch has alleviated the swiping and ordering of nonsense online. 

As Dave Ramsey says “Cash causes pain.” And that’s the truth! I spend cash and I feel a twinge, no matter how small. "
Tjf331,"As I understand it, the agency you work for deducts 1% of it per paycheck per year. At the end of that time, you will have 30% of your pay saved. They expect you to make 40% off of the market or through the TSP’s performance + match. The other remainder is Social Security, which you can take earlier then eligible after 30 years of service as a “thanks for serving the people” benefit. This is all information as I believe it to be right, but definitely ask around before making any decisions. 
I believe that box is the total amount your agency paid into your retirement, which is that 1% automatic, and whatever matching contribution you elected. 
I don’t believe you have any access to any of that money until retirement age, as it’s almost entrust to you until retirement. The only accessible cash I can think of is on the TSP site via a loan against what you’ve contributed or early withdraw. Early withdraw comes with harsh harsh penalties and is not worth it. "

If you want to experience more of nature and like walking, hiking, outdoor activities, and quieter streets, Maine has that. New England in general has a much more solidarity to it. If you typically are an outcast, you might struggle in how “typical” Maine can be on the outside. "

Don’t call one of those negotiation services like Bill shark; they’ll just get you a new promotional offer that’ll be more services for the same or slightly less.

I highly highly highly recommend your wife and you look up Dave Ramsey and follow his baby steps."

"
0422,"you should post to r/financialindependence

However, I agree with everyone else's verdict - you aren't saving enough and spending 25k+ on cars is going to delay your retirement.

Purchasing in cash isn't always king, it is taking advantage of low interest rates in order to max our your investments. 


[Also, here's a fun little calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/retirement/retirement-plan-calculator.aspx) - though it doesn't allow you to do a 25% withdrawal"
0422,"For a $500k home, and only 10% down, and depending what your local taxes will be, expect to pay $3200-3500/month. A bank typically wont lend if your debt to income ratio is 40% or more. Just keep that in mind. 

Paying down students loan should absolutely be your #1 priority. It seems you might be able to pay it off in about a year. If you can eliminate that debt, your credit score will be happier and applying for a mortgage will be a bit easier. 

Look into HUD certified classes in your area for first time homebuyers. They are usually curtailed to the county you live in, and they will explain all the grants and special loans you may be eligible for when buying a home. My husband and I did it together and found it really really enlightening. 

Also, I would really really really consider increasing your retirement. If you put in up to the federal threshold, its tax deductible, and if you are adamant on buying a home, you could borrow from your 401k to pay for it (not recommended though). 5% of 60k without a pension is pretty small, especially as you enter your 30s.  "
0422,"If your kids are smart and ambitious, there are serious advantages of sending your kid to a Duke or University of Chicago or Columbia. A lot of private colleges also offer generous financial aid packages and scholarships. But I was not really advocating that, I was comparing the rise of private education costs parallel the rise of in state tuition costs too. 

However, depending on how old your kids are right now, expect their tuition costs to be between 80-100k each for a four year state school within the next ten years. That may or may not include any mandatory housing or meal plan packages. I would easily bet that tuition costs in 15-20 years to be between 30-50k/year for in state."
0422,"Have a small ceremony with your close family and friends and eat at a local restaurant. $13,000 can barely pay for a venue and food in many many many many places. My husband and I eloped, best decision we ever made and lots of our married friends agree.

$700,000 is a lifetime of debt. You cant even pay that off with one years salary as a doctor immediately, and it will take you guys more than 6-7 years to even begin earning any kind of real money. 

Save that money as an emergency fund instead. 

"
0422,"Pay off your student loans. 

Will your gf also have student loans? If so, paying yours down will help you both when calculating your debt to income ratio. Lenders like your debt to income ratio to be under 30% and definitely 40%. 

Lenders also look at 2 years of salary in order to give you your cap. If you gf gets out of grad school right before buying a house, and she has loans, it might be a tough bet. 

Pay off your loans. It's an immediate return on your investment. Once your gf graduates and you both are doing well in your careers, live off one income and save the rest - you'll have a down payment in no time. 

Btw, the house my husband and I thought we wanted to buy in our late 20s is directly opposite of what we now need in our early 30s. I'm glad we waited, rented in a few wildly different neighborhoods, and landed really excellent jobs that have informed our housing location. I recommend taking this time to do your research. "
0422,"You guys will be fine!! 

Now that your wife will be full time stay at home, maybe consider her job not just as ""mommy"" but house manager. When I was part time stay at home, my job was 1) manage household finances 2) cook meals and do all chores and 3) SAVE MONEY. 

It got to the point where I was such a finesse cook and shopper that our grocery budget was $250/month and going out to eat was $60. I found extra savings on ANYTHING we needed to buy, and was the savviest of shoppers. When I was home, I rocked our savings account and made it our priority. Your wife being home may help you guys decide cloth instead of disposable diapers, home made food instead of prepackaged, and hand making all of your goods instead of processed as significant cost savings.  

Is there any way to decrease your rent? Maybe move out farther from city center? 

How much is left on your student loans? Is this your wife loans? Was she on PSLF since she was a teacher? Can you refinance IBR or covert to sofi if private to lower your monthly dues?"
0422,"lol. its called Freetaxusa, and although it does offer free tax filing for those who make under 65k, as all tax systems must, but they have a 10% coupon off services if you must pay. 

My husband and I use it. We had complicated taxes too,l and make over 6 figures. It took us about 20 mins. "
0422,"How long and often are you stationed in America? Last thing you want is a car in storage that your paying for, an ocean away, that you spent too much money on. 

Look for cars in the 6-8k range with low miles, like a 2012 Fit. "
0422,"You keep circling huge loads of debt, trying to justify your savings, when its costing you a lot of money to keep 70k liquid. Immediately take that 70k and pay down your debts, whether it be car, student loans or cc debt. 

I would stop anticipating the amount of money you may receive at your wedding, and only consider it once it is actually in your hands. If you guys must financially contrbute to this wedding, those gifts would actually most likely be just zeroing out your book. 

If the student loans are not your fiance's, who might be able to apply for loan forgiveness, and if she is adamant about continuing to be a teacher the entire time, literally wipe these out. That is more than half your annual combined salary and will be immediately pinged for your debt to income ratio, along with the cars. 

And franky, on 110k net a year, a 400k house is way out of your range. I would say the max you guys should try to afford is 260. I know your area is expensive, but a house seriously isn't everything, its just shelter. 

If you are truly able to save 4k a month, you can have 80k for a down payment, no less than that!!!, saved in 2 years. That seems totally palatable, especially if you consider the time frame you are already thinking about 

Edit: also would suggest taking a HUD approved first time buyers class in your county. They are typically free and really give you some.great advice on home ownership and seeking loans. If your fiance is a teacher, she probably qualifies for special loans or grants that may be less than 4.75%. 

Also, that $1,900 extra you calculated could be eaten up immediately by one poorly timed housing expense.  

"
0422,"A good rule of thumb is for every 100k for the house, add at least $500 to the mortgage. So, a 500k house is gonna be at least $2500/month. That's not including hoa, taxes, or anything else you add to it. "
0422,"What's the interest rate on your car loan? 

What is your current take home pay and your expenses? 

If your cc debt is manageable before interest kicks in, DO NOT PAY IT OFF EARLY. You are essentially throwing away a little bit of free money. 

Going upside down on a car loan and then purchase an older car is just silly unless you actually can't afford the monthly payment. 

I also subscribe to dave ramsey, but you have not provided enough info in order to make the best financial decisions. He actually does not have a one size fits all viewpoint. 

Without any other information, my initial reaction is save a 3-6 month emergency fund (most people can't pay rent or mortgage with a credit card if you lose your job), stay the course on the cc, and pay as much as you can on the truck to pay it down earlier.  "
0422,"I usually recommend starting with the Total Money Makeover book, but I feel like since your wife is being evasive about this conversation, see if you guys can attend one of his free Financial University lectures. They are typically sponsored by churches. Dave Ramsey will speak for an hour or so and give advice on individually concerns. He has a podcast if you'd like to check that out. 

I'm really rooting for you! I'm so glad you want to tackle your debts and get your lifestyle on track. My husband and I have been doing this for two years, and even though occasionally we fall off the wagon, it makes us stronger when we get back on. I hope the same for you and your wife :)



"
0422,"Upkeep is one aspect of it. The other if that when you go to sell, you typically pay about 6% of the sale price to agent. So, if you guys wanna move in 5 years, you've thrown, lets say 15k into repairs or upkeep, and then you need to move to a better school district but can only sell the house for 90k, well, you'll pay about 2.7k to the agent, meaning that you'll net 87.5k - you not only lost the 15k, you also lost an additional $200. 

There are many many many factors to consider, nor just upfront price. "
0422,"Omg, dont buy a house. Esp. In VAB where property fluctuates wildly depending on what block you live. 

You also have no experience whatsoever with Hampton Roads traffic and I would highly suggest finding some coworker roommates and living as close to base as possible. "
0422,"If you were planning on paying for your kids college, the $250/month is not going to fully fund it. At base, it is only $54k and with 4% interest, a meager $90k after 18 years. I would seriously consider upping that and aim at least for 60-80k costs per kid. Any top 25 college at the moment is currently base 50k/year, no reason inflation should not drive it even higher. And when that happens, state schools follow. 

I can see the appeal of being mortgage free, but honestly, invest the money especially if you want to retire fully funded. Dave Ramsey generally has ludicrously bad investment advice and while being mortgage free is appealing, its not gonna garner you big bucks or a secure retirement. Only time will.  An initial investment of $140k, at a typical market return of 5% with 30 years of investment is $605,000. However, your mortgage will still stay at $X,xxx per month as your salary goes up. Paying an additional month or two on your mortgage each year (if your mortgage is 1200 and you add $100-200 additional each month to the principal, you save like 50k in interest on the loan). 

I know this may seem like an easy decision or a cheaper decision, but there is a reason economists say that when you win the lottery, take the whole pot, bc over time you'll make more money despite how much they take out. "
0422,"Wait. 

Wait until you are married. 

Wait until you land your real jobs. There are many reasons for this one. If you guys wait until you land real jobs, you can: 

1) qualify for way more house. This way you wouldn't need to sell once you have kids or absorb a parent.

2) Buy a house in an appreciating district. I'm sure its safe to say that a 90k or even 150k house isn't in the most promising location in the Atlanta area. 

3) Possibly buy closer to your full time employer.

&gt;&gt;How long did it take before you were able to ""recoup"" the cash?

It was a windfall so I don't feel like I have to ""recoup"" anything, although I invested the balance left over.

cjw_5110,"Got it. Recommendation remains the same, in this case. 

Personally, I hate saving for no reason - no sense squirreling money away for an uncertain future unless I know what I want to do with it. Therefore, I like to back into the number I need to save to make retirement happen. 

If you know what kind of retirement you want to have, figure out roughly how much you will need to support yourselves and when you want your retirement to start. Do it all in today's dollars. For example, I know that my wife and I want to do some traveling, we will want to spoil our grandchildren (assuming we're lucky enough to have them), we will want to go out to eat frequently, and we'll want to do fun stuff in our local area; we also won't have loans, as we're building our lives around paying off our mortgage prior to age-60. All told, we'll probably need around 100% of what we currently make (after taxes and saving) in order to make that happen for the first few years of retirement, but that number will drop to 50% within 8-10 years. Knowing what we will likely need and how long we will likely need it, we can back into our number, and knowing historical market returns, we can figure out what we need to save in order to have ~90% chance of being OK.

I would do a similar exercise if I were you. In my planning, I would assume that VA disability payments are still there but Social Security is not. Any SS you do get will be a bonus. 

If you have access to an HSA, I'd max that puppy out. I assume that your medical needs related to the service will be handled by the VA, but your spouse's needs will not be, and having a healthy savings will protect you both in the future, when medical costs are inevitably higher."
cjw_5110,"1x salary by age-30 is a great rule of thumb for somebody who started in a career-track position right out of college, at age-22, and who has experienced modest wage growth and a reasonable investment market in the first eight years of their career. For you, it's only natural that you'll be a little behind that figure since you will have had 37.5% less time in your career. 

What you should do is look at a retirement calculator and see what you're likely to have at retirement, and then try to imagine what your retirement will look like - will you spend more, the same or less? Think also about your pension. Will you be at your company long enough to qualify for the pension, and if so, what is it likely to look like? How likely is it that the pension will still be there for you in retirement? Depending on the answers to those questions, your pension becomes part of your plan or acts as a bonus (kind of like Social Security for people in their 20s and 30s). 

I started saving right out of college, but my income today is 2.5x my income at age-22; when I turn 30 next month, I'll have around 80% of my salary saved. My wife started saving right out of college too, but she didn't get into a career-track kind of job until she was 26. She didn't have a 401k option at her work, and she didn't have the resources to contribute a significant amount to her IRA, until she was 29, so her retirement balance is closer to 50% of her salary (most in a Roth account). Given our expectations for retirement, we are confident that we will not outlive our money, even without changing saving habits. "
cjw_5110,"It depends on how much you earn taxable. However, let me just make one thing clear. Money is fungible. This means that it makes no difference whether you invest money put into your account from the VA (thank you for your service and sacrifice, by the way... I assume $45k is roughly 100% on the scale?) or from your regular income; it's all the same in the end. 

Let's say you are married filing jointly and earn $75k as a couple in taxable income. After deductions, you'll fall into the 12% federal tax bracket. If you each contribute $6,000 to your Roth IRA, then you will pay taxes like nothing happened and will pay no taxes when you withdraw the funds in retirement; if you each contribute $6,000 to your traditional IRA, you will pay $1,440 less in taxes this year but will pay the blended rate when you withdraw. It does not matter what you used to fund your IRA or Roth IRA; the tax impact is identical.

Whether you *want* to use Roth vs Traditional is a different conversation. If you have $300k in taxable income today but only plan to withdraw the future equivalent of half of that in retirement, then it makes sense to do Traditional; if you have $75k in taxable income today but plan to withdraw way more than that in retirement, then it makes sense to do Roth. Your VA money comes into play in terms of how much you'll need to withdraw while in retirement. If you expect to need $100k/yr out of pocket to live while in retirement, that means you will need to find $55k in some form or other, since $45k is guaranteed for the rest of your life. $55k can come from a combination of Roth, Traditional, Social Security and taxable means. Ultimately, it's your call on how to do it."
cjw_5110,"Down payment does not influence return on investment. 

As others said, your calculation of return on investment should be based on...

* Current home purchase price
* Projected future home purchase price\*\*
* Maintenance costs (commonly 1-2% of home value annually)
* Projected rental cost for the duration of your period of homeownership\*\*\*
* Opportunity cost of investing down payment in home vs. investing in an index fund\*\*
* Direct cost of closing
* Opportunity cost of investment return on closing costs\*\*

\*\* Make an assumption about inflation rate, and do a present value calculation on this based on expected returns of the relevant investment (maybe 5% for home appreciation, 8% for index fund return)

\*\*\* Figure out the present value of rental costs based on the average increase in rent vs. inflation rates.

I'm probably missing some things here, but the point is that you need to account for everything when you're doing your calculation. "
cjw_5110,"I was you twelve years ago - thought I was able to make some real money in the market with a little day trading. Turns out, I was not, as an individual college-age investor with relatively little money and (no finance/investing/economics experience besides intro econ), subject to 15-minute lag on equity pricing and without a Bloomberg Terminal to use, able to beat a market driven by full-time bankers and immensely powerful algorithms.

An individual's decision to short or invest in a company is driven nearly entirely by the WAG method - Wild-Ass Guess. The reality is that, by the time you or I see any news stories that are detrimental to a given company, the market has already crawled the web, found the story, adjusted its targets and positions, and pushed the stock. 

The most likely scenario is that you will lose money by pulling your investments into cash; if you wind up ahead, that's awesome! But be weary about fooling yourself into believing it was anything other than luck. "
cjw_5110,"I can certainly understand! My wife and I had our first last year, and she went back to work after four months specifically because she was afraid that she'd have a hard time getting back into the workforce if she took an extended absence. 

One relatively easy thing that you can consider to guard against the unthinkable is to have your boyfriend take out a term life insurance policy, with you as the sole beneficiary and your son as the secondary beneficiary, for 10x his income, for 20-30 years. 10x income is widely regarded as the standard to protect stay-at-home spouses. It's also worthwhile for you to consider taking out a modest life insurance policy; if you were to pass, your boyfriend will incur added expenses - at the very least, expenses for child care and, once your son is in school, before- and after-school programs - that you won't incur with you staying home. Life insurance is often ignored by twentysomethings (I assume you're in your 20s), but the best time to buy life insurance is when you're  young. "
cjw_5110,"Keep in mind that, out of 41,000 people who applied for PSLF in 2018, 206 were succesful - 0.5%. Make sure that you have *all* your ducks in a row with respect to this program. If not, then you're going to have a rough time in the not-so-distant future."
cjw_5110,"22 corners to contend with, including some that are tight squeezes, a full time job, and a one year old make figuring it out on my own much less reasonable.

If it were a straight forward rectangular space, I'd 100% do it myself, but that's just not the case here. For the area and cost of living, our final cost is very fair "
cjw_5110,"No. Rent to own virtually doesn't exist anyway, and even if it did, it would be just a different way to separate you from your hard-earned money.

My response to you has nothing to do with what a bank will approve you for. When my wife and I were searching for our first home, we made \~$130k and paid $300/mo in debts (car + student loans). When we started going through pre-approval processes, the first bank we spoke to started talking about pre-approving us for $525,000. There is absolutely, positively, no way that we could afford $525,000 without putting every free penny we own into a damn house, but the bank doesn't care about our ability to do things outside of debt service. The bank only cares that we will literally be capable of servicing the debt.

You can go out and find a bank that will pre-approve you for a $350,000 home, but that doesn't mean that you should.

You know nothing about your husband's ex-wife's boyfriend's financial situation, and you should absolutely not be thinking about that person when considering your own financial future.

When I was a kid, I had a friend whose family was pretty much like mine - middle-class homeowners, living in a low-cost city but in a suburban area of the city. When we were 11 (in 2000), his parents moved them to a McMansion in the suburbs; I didn't really think too much about the actual finances involved there, but I can tell you that the house his parents sold was worth around $190k and the one they moved into was probably worth around $500k. 

I was so surprised by how rich he was...we drifted apart, as kids do, especially when they go to different schools, but I came to find out that his parents moved into an apartment in 2007. Why? Because they were ""able to afford"" their huge house by taking an adjustable rate mortgage at 2-ish% interest for the first five years, after which point the rate adjusted to 6-ish%. Their mortgage payment increased by $1,000 a month, and they couldn't refinance into another ARM or a lower fixed-rate mortgage; they couldn't sell their house because they had taken out a second mortgage to finance other parts of their lives and because the house was only worth $450k when their rate adjusted, so the bank foreclosed on their home, and they were left with basically nothing.

Separately, I have a different friend, whose parents own a home very much like mine growing up - a little bigger and in a nicer area, but pretty comparable. In high school, we were very close, and though I knew his family had a decent amount of money, they came off as very down-to-earth. Since we've graduated high school, we've stayed close. His family is just the same as always, but they've made a few...purchases. First, they bought a townhome downtown, for their mid-twenty-something daughter to live in. The townhome cost about $550k in 2011, when they bought it, and they eventually sold it to their daughter at a substantial discount after she established herself as a working professional. The next year, they were at a beach resort one state over, when they saw a charming house in a highly-desirable area, with a dock. They bought that house too - $950,000, with cash. I had had no idea that they were so fabulously wealthy because they did not ""show off"" - they drove their cars 'til they died, they never had cable TV, etc. 

I tell these two stories to drive home the point that people's finances are not as they seem. Your husband's ex-wife's boyfriend could be up to his ears in debt, house poor with the mortgage, and paying nosebleed-level interest rates on thousands of dollars on his credit cards; he could also come from a wealthy family and have a trust fund that paid for the house; he could also have gotten a tremendous price on the home. You just don't know. What you *do* know is that you, yourself, are not currently prepared for the financial burdens of homeownership. 

None of this is to mention the fact that you want to have a baby of your own soon. As a first-time-dad of a nearly-one-year-old, let me just tell you that kids are *expensive*. In the first 11 months of my baby's life, we have spent $3,000 on the baby herself, $4,755 on medical care (having the baby and taking her to the doctor since then), $12,733 on child care, and $1,500 to furnish the nursery (this is obviously one you can really cut down on, but still). All told, our baby has cost us more than $20,000 in her first year on this earth. We were prepared for this, financially, because I do pretty well and my wife got short-term disability through her work, which paid 60% of 5 weeks of maternity leave. 

If you're going to have a baby and if you're the sole reliable earner in the household, you're going to need to figure out how to pay for everything you currently have going on, plus additional costs that come in the first few months of a baby's life, all while you are getting, at best, a fraction of your current paycheck. It is challenging enough when you're renting, where most of your costs are fixed. It's a bigger challenge when you're juggling all of that in a home that you also need to pay to maintain. Our washing machine broke the week after our daughter was born. Our choices to deal were a) pay several hundred dollars to replace it or b) try to manage by lugging ourselves to a laundromat multiple times a week. We chose the former, and we wound up spending around $800 after all was said and done. 

From the sounds of it, a random, added $1,000 expense would be a substantial setback for you right now. If that's the case, then imagine that kind of setback when your family has lower cash flow (due to maternity leave), higher fixed expenses (due to a fourth member of your family), and a depleted savings (due to a home purchase).

Based on the information you provided, you are looking for reasons to go down a path that will provide you with short-term gratification - showing that you, too, can buy a home if somebody whose financial situation is potentially worse than yours can - while injecting long-term risk about your family's financial solvency. I implore you, **do not do this**. "
cjw_5110,"What a world we live in...

If I am reading other sites correctly, transfers from other banks can actually be coded as direct deposits, so I could just transfer a bunch of money from, say, Capital One 360, to Citizens and have that count as a direct deposit?? If so, this seems super easy to get!"
cjw_5110,"Banking Fees - Pay attention to them! I know this is well-worn ground, but I thought it would be worthwhile to mention once more. If you haven't done so in a while, take a look at the fees your bank charges, and see what other banks are offering - you may be able to save a *substantial* amount of money.

I've been a happy member of USAA since I turned 16 and got my driver's license. In 2008, I opened a checking account with USAA, and it quickly became my primary bank account. By 2010, I had closed out all of my other accounts, and I've been happy ever since. I can't deposit cash, but that's a small price to pay for what I've grown accustomed to. 

Last week, I opened a Citizens account so I could take advantage of their $600 bonus, and I am only now realizing how spoiled I am. I haven't done all that much with it yet, but I've already discovered some substantial differences in costs between Citizens and USAA...

&amp;#x200B;

|Item|Citizens|USAA|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Interest Rate|N/A|0.1% on balances &gt; $1,000|
|Maintenance|$9.99 (waived with deposit activity)|Free|
|Checks|$27+|Free|
|Transfer to external account|$3|Free|
|Out-of-network ATM fees|Free up to 4 per cycle, then $3|Free|
|Out-of-network ATM POS Fees|No protection|Reimbursement up to $12/mo|

I knew I was spoiled, but I didn't know *how* spoiled I was until I opened this account. "
cjw_5110,"Don't forget that what OP's client / future employer is paying includes benefits that they would need to pay on top of a permanent employee's salary. If you are a company paying a recruiting firm $45/hr, your total cost for one FTE (1,960 hours) is $88,200. If that same company were paying you $35/hr as a full time employee, your salary would translate to $72,800/yr. They'd also pay employer portion of payroll tax ($5,569), 401k match (let's assume they match up to 4% of salary, so $2,912), medical benefits (assume \~$300/mo or $3,600/yr, other insurance (basic life, AD&amp;D, STD, LTD, EAP; call it $1,000/yr). 

With the above assumptions, you're already up to $85,881, AND you have the added risk of not being able to sever the relationship on a dime. When you pay a firm for resources, you pay a premium because you can tell that firm you don't like the person they gave you, and that person can be replaced nearly instantly, at no direct cost to you. Not the same when you have a permanent employee. Even though most states operate at-will, turnover is still very costly (probably a minimum of $10,000 per employee, and much more if a recruiting firm is involved).

From an employee's perspective, there are benefits to becoming a permanent employee as well, and you shouldn't underestimate them. 

I'm not saying that you shouldn't ask for a certain amount; just recognize that it's not as simple as ""well I'm getting this as a contractor, so I should get this other amount as a FTE"" ... $35 seems pretty reasonable to ask for, as does $38. If you're wanted, then nobody's going to get scared away by a high ask; they'll just offer you something lower and see what you say."
cjw_5110,"It depends on your definition of being able to retire. If someone is completely comfortable living a modest life in retirement, then it is entirely reasonable to save less, for a shorter period. 

I expect to require 50% of my family's current combined salary in order to have a VERY comfortable retirement. How? Well... 1) Around 25% of our expected balance will be in Roth accounts, meaning we can control our tax exposure such that we will pay around 12-13% instead of our effective 25% rate today (no state/local tax on retirement income since it was already taxed!); 2) We're not going to be saving 10% for retirement in retirement; 3) We do not expect to have a mortgage payment (just taxes and insurance), so that saves 7%; 4) We don't expect to have student loans or auto loans, so that saves another 7%; 5) We don't expect to be putting our income into a short-term savings account for things like major home improvements, so that saves another 9%; 6) While our healthcare costs will likely be higher, our general living costs will be lower (will be pretty great not to pay 8-10% of our income in daycare!). 

Since we only need to have 50% of our income replaced, we don't *need* to save the recommended 12-15%, but to be safe we do actually save 14% inclusive of company contributions.

If we wanted to spend our retirement traveling the world or making serious charitable donations or living a life of comparative luxury, then 50% would be nowhere near enough, but because we don't want that, we don't need to have 75-100% income replacement. "
cjw_5110,"As others said, I'd avoid contributing the $3,000 outside of the payroll cycle. I'd actually take this a step further, though. If I were you, I would ask my employer to increase my contribution such that I would max out the HSA, and I would invest whatever you are able instead of reimbursing yourself right away. You can invest just like a 401k or IRA (usually with limited options), and reap the benefits of long-term market gains. You would get the immediate benefits of tax savings, and you will get the long-term benefits of investment.

What you *could* do is pay *all* of your medical bills out of pocket, keep track of the expenses, and then withdraw from your HSA when you want/need it, some point in the future. The way the law is structured, there is no limit on when you can reimburse yourself, so if you pay, say, $50,000 in medical expenses over the next 25 years, you would be able to take out up to $50,000 sometime in the future, completely tax-free. No other investment instrument is so powerful."
cjw_5110,"I've looked into other banks but just can't beat USAA. The network effect is strong - I have multiple insurance accounts through USAA, and it's a seamless experience to work with their banking group as well. Customer service is top-notch, and their website and app are both very stable and very useful (I have to laugh when banks advertise their mobile deposit feature, which USAA has had for as long as I've had a smart device..in my case, since 2011). All together, it's worth a slightly-lower interest rate (at the end of the day, I'm sacrificing less than $5 a year). 

I also derive value from some other things, like ATM fee reimbursement and free overdraft protection. I run my checking account down as low as possible every month since I'm putting money in savings regularly, and sometimes I get my timing wrong. It's nice that my only ""charge"" is losing 1/6 savings account withdrawals for the month when I do get that timing wrong."
cjw_5110,"The Citi price protection benefit really makes a difference for me. I've recovered well over $2,000 in the three years I've had the card (it's really good when you are bent over a barrel and need to buy something right away, without being able to comparison shop...last year I had to replace a car part that the dealer charged $300 for... Found it online for $180 and got a $120 statement credit a few later) "
cjw_5110,"I'd look into...

1. Roth 401k contributions (if you suspect you will be in a higher bracket in retirement than you're in now, which isn't a terrible idea given the current low tax rates and your high income at a young age)
2. After-tax 401k contributions - if your employer's funds are good (i.e. decent options, low fees), you can contribute up to $55k in total, across employer contributions and your contributions. This can get rolled into a Roth IRA after you separate from your company, so it's effectively bumping up your ability to save in a tax-advantaged account.
3. Taxable brokerage account"
cjw_5110,"As others said, rules of thumb are just suggestions. Ultimately housing costs are personal.

Some people want to get the most house they possibly can; others have a specific type of house in mind (for example, my dream home is 4 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, no more than 1,700 sqft... in my area, that's a cottage compared to the 8,000 sqft monstrosities that are around), which has a cost range that could be well within their means or well beyond their means.

Some people live in ultra-high cost of living areas, where it's laughable to think that you could find housing that costs less than 28% of *gross* income; meanwhile, my wife and I pay 24% of my net income (and my wife works full time too) in a moderate-COL area.

Home price is only a rule of thumb because other factors can be dramatically different. For example, a $400,000 loan at 4%  interest for 30 years costs $1,909.66; at 6% interest, it's $2,398. If we add in taxes, if we assume that $400k loan is based on a $500k home and taxes are 1% per year or $5,000, then your monthly payment at 4% is $2,326; if taxes are 2% per year or $10,000 and your mortgage is 6%, then your monthly payment becomes $3,232 - almost $1,000 more. I could comfortably afford a home payment of $2,326, but $3,232 is ridiculous to me. It is possible, however, that these wildly different payments could be on the exact same house sold for the exact same price with exactly the same amount down.

My *personal* measure when buying a home was that I wanted my wife and me to pay less than 25% of our combined take-home pay. At the time, that meant a mortgage payment of $1,925 or less. We wound up with a payment of $1,682, which we refinanced two years later to a payment of $1,500-ish. With that payment basically locked (it'll go up a little each year as insurance and taxes adjust with inflation), we knew that our mortgage would become a less- and less-significant part of our monthly budget as the years go on. Just four years after buying our home, our mortgage is now less than 15% of our take-home pay and 9% of our gross pay. To get to that initial $1,925 or less, with the amount we had saved for the home at the time, we could buy a home for $330k or less, so $330k became our absolute-max budget and $260k-$280k was our target range.

In other words, it's really whatever you're comfortable spending, factoring in everything specific to you."
cjw_5110,"Oh absolutely - I'm on that train for most things as well. I replaced all of the light fixtures in my house last year, including adding two ceiling fans. It definitely took a while to tackle the first ceiling fan since I didn't know what I was doing, but the second one was up, working and balanced in under an hour. I figured an electrician would charge at least $500-600 for the job, so I easily came out on top. Same when it comes to basic car maintenance - engine air filter, cabin air filter, windshield wipers, no problem. In January I replaced my sump pump, and two years ago I replaced my hot water heater.

If I reasonably suspect that I can do the same job as a contractor can, with roughly the same quality outcome, then I'll take it on myself. But I also need to have the humility to recognize when a professional job would be worthwhile. Part of that is asking myself, would a future homeowner feel as compelled to tear up a floor that I install as I feel about this floor? My answer, given how much detail work needed to be done in my kitchen, was probably. If a future homeowner is going to feel compelled to tear up the floor, they're going to figure that into their offer, even if it isn't front of mind (it definitely factored into our offer, even though it wasn't a specific ""we are taking $2,500 off our offer because this floor sucks hard""), so in the long run, I'm very comfortable hiring a pro for this one.

I think I mentioned before - if this were my living room, I'd absolutely have done it myself. That room is a 600 sqft rectangle with 8 corners, none of which require all that much detail or precision (most walls have baseboard heat, so if the floor doesn't get all the way to the wall in a section or two, nobody will notice/care). But this kitchen is a nightmare. No way I could get it done well on my own without spending an inordinate amount of time working on it and throwing out half of my materials after I screw up the cuts."
cjw_5110,"Yep, pretty much in line with my suggestion. Of course, some people are comfortable being a little house poor. Too risky for my blood, though.

Found out my neighbor just sold his house for nearly $400k...it's a bit bigger than mine, but not too much. Mine would probably go for $360k, based on that comp. Bought for $280k three years ago. Feeling pretty good right now! "
cjw_5110,"I'd definitely contact a realtor about your equity question. A realtor can help you to get the most bang for your buck (e.g. should you add insulation and make it a workshop in addition to a regular garage? Should you add electricity aside from an electric door opener?). In some areas, this add-on will be basically worthless; in others, it could be absolutely worthwhile. All depends on where you live."
cjw_5110,"It depends highly on the role and company you are heading into. I'd guess that it isn't a consultant role at MBB since you typically need a postgraduate degree to get that. Those roles start in the $140-160k range. Same goes for big 4 strategy. I don't think you are looking at these roles, but if you are, it's a set salary (which, for some companies, is transparent to all employees). 

My guess is you're looking at a consultant level role (consultant or senior associate), outside of strategy, which would put you in the $90-110k range + per diem / travel reimbursement + 10% bonus target, give or take. 

For whatever it's worth, I recently (one year ago) left a small consulting firm that did not require travel. They didn't hire associates or consultants, but their pay scale was something like $90-100k for SC, $115-125k for managers (plus $2,500 per quarter utilization bonus if 80% utilized or higher), $140-160k for ages senior managers (plus utilization bonus), and $220-260k (plus $40-80k in sales related compensation). We consciously took about 15% less than we'd otherwise be willing to take as the trade for not traveling. 

My current company (limited travel) is all over the map, but my understanding is that it's $50-65k + 5% bonus target for associates, $70-95k + 7% bonus target for consultants (2-6 years experience), $110-150k + 10% for senior consultants (5-15 years experience), $160-200k + 14% for managers (8-25 years experience), and $220-300k + 20% + stock award for principals (10+ years experience). Bump up everything by about 20% for the strategy folks. 

Your current salary is irrelevant to your new role, so don't think of your negotiating position in terms of your current salary. That will only serve to weaken you. Instead, think of your negotiating position in terms of what it will take to get you to yes and what you see as fair for the role. You're well within your rights to ask for $130-150k as an all in amount, and you'll be within the ballpark if you get $100 + 10%."
cjw_5110,"This is unrelated to the specific issue you are raising, but I need to comment on your situation, as it is dangerous for you. As an unmarried person with no income, you have VERY few protections in the event of unexpected circumstances. 

If your boyfriend dies, your son will be entitled to 75% of your boyfriend's expected benefit amount upon full retirement age, and he will receive that until he turns 18. Because you are unmarried, you are entitled to 0%; if you were married, you would be entitled to 75% until your son turns 16 years old. 

If he dies and has no will, then all of his assets will pass to your son and, depending on your state's specific laws, other members of his family, including his parents. Any assets that your son inherits is held essentially in limbo until he is either 18 or 21 years old. It's doubtful that you can have any jointly owned property since you have no income to support your ownership claim, so if he dies, that property automatically enters into probate. Since the primary beneficiary of your boyfriend's estate will likely be your son and since your son can't take control of the estate until he reaches adulthood, it is likely that property will be sold under an estate sale. 

This has multiple negative elements: 1) you will lose a place to live; 2) the property will likely sell for less than market value; and 3) the proceeds of the sale are reduced by the share allocated to the executor of the estate, which is most likely one of his parents or an independently-appointed attorney. If you were married, then even if he were to own the property entirely himself (i.e. even if it is not jointly owned), you would be legally entitled to live there, and when the time comes, your child(ren) would be allowed to make a decision on whether to sell the property (if you agree to it); this type of rule varies by state, but this is the basic gist of things.

If your relationship disintegrates, you will not get any financial compensation except in the form of child support. In the eyes of the law, you are currently your own entity who is managing to survive with no income; in terms of your family, you provide the valuable service of caring for your child and, presumably, for your home as your full-time job. If you were married, then divorce would likely result in some form of alimony payments, which can help you to get back on your feet. 

Also on the topic of breakup, since you have not worked in years, if you were to break up, you would have a harder time winning custody of your son - you need to be able to demonstrate an ability to support both yourself and your child, and since you aren't entitled to alimony, the only help you'd get from your boyfriend would be child support. Literally the first thing to do if you break up is to find employment. 

I'm saying all of this not as a judgement of your life - no judgement here! - but as a caution. You have virtually no protections as an unmarried, stay-at-home parent if life doesn't go as planned. If I were you, I would seriously consider finding employment, getting legally married, or, at the absolute least, drafting legal documents that establish a will, living will, medical directive, and any other possible documentation to help protect you in the event that your boyfriend passes or your relationship becomes untenable."
cjw_5110,"To be clear, /u/_Rofo is correct about lump sum beating dollar-cost averaging most of the time, BUT that assumes that you have the money to drop into the account all at once. Most of us save as we go, which has the effect of dollar-cost averaging.

OP, your best bet is to put what you can into your Roth IRA now. Set up automatic transfers automatic investing, and do not touch things until you are at retirement age (except to rebalance your accounts to your target allocations a few times a year)."
cjw_5110,"You aren't stuck anywhere. If you go out and find a new job, you negotiate the terms of your start date based on what works for you and for your new employer. It's up to your current employer to a) counter your offer with something you can't refuse or b) plan for your departure. It's business, not personal. 

By the way, $2,500 isn't a big number - certainly nothing to fret about when it comes to a long-term decision such as seeking new employment. I'm a management consultant, and $2,500 doesn't even pay for a day of my time based on what my company bills for me (...boy I wish *I* could get $2,500+ a day for my work...)."
cjw_5110,"That logic really doesn't work when you're looking for products and services together. There is real value to having someone work with you to ensure you have everything you need, order it (and take responsibility is the manufacturer messes up), deliver it, and install it, warranting that their install job is sufficient. 

Could I have done all of that myself? Sure, but instead of two active hours to complete the transaction and get the job done, I'd have to spend in the neighborhood of ten hours, just on coordination, equipment rental (e.g. Nail gun for quarter round), and purchasing, and then I'd need to spend another full day or longer actually installing the product. Before I know it, the job is at 25 hours of my time. I value my time less than my equivalent hourly wage, but not by much... I'd say my free time is worth $40 an hour, meaning hired labor costs under $1,000 are worthwhile to me. I can spend more time doing other things by not worrying about this. "
cjw_5110,"If I were you, I would go to a doctor who accepts insurance and ask for an opinion and a referral, and I would then work with insurance to get the procedure covered. I had an ""elective"" surgery four years ago to fix a deviated septum (not cosmetic surgery) and some other things, and that was absolutely covered by insurance. Total came to \~$30k, and I paid $1,500, $750 of which was covered by my employer via HSA contribution."

""HSH.com, the mortgage-information firm, says, for example, that a borrower with $1 million in assets could count $700,000. After taking out $10,000 for closing costs and dividing by 360, the borrower could show $1,917 in monthly income.""  So, not much relative to your other income.

You'd have to expect that you'd be putting down a larger down payment to keep the mortgage payment somewhat reasonable."
yes_its_him,"So....you own one place free and clear, and it makes $X rent.

And now you'd like to bulldoze that, bringing your rent to zero for a while, and then put up a multifamily unit (which will make you popular with your neighbors...) at a cost of $250,000.   

So, you lose whatever the value of the old house was, and now you have a new small apartment.  That $250K construction cost might get you 2000 sq ft finished, which is small for three units.   That doesn't count site prep (including electrical / plumbing / gas etc) , parking, landscaping, etc.   

So you'd have to figure out what your breakeven period would be, based on the lost value of the old property, lost rent, and increased carrying costs subtracted from the new, higher rental income. 

It seems that there's another way to go that involves selling this property and just buying an existing multifamily unit."
yes_its_him,"You pay at least 50% more  for rent, utilities and medical bills as a typical family would. These should be under $3k at that income level.  Instead, they are close to 50% of your gross income.  This is why you have no money.

But if you had 70000 rental income and 50000 rental deductions, that wouldn't show up in that rollup.  And then the question would be about your personal  itemized deductions.  Maybe you had property taxes and state income taxes combined that were over $10k."

Default87,"Do not invest your emergency fund, keep it in a HYSA and let it do its job, which is being a secure asset that you can access in an emergency. 

Past your emergency fund, you generally will invest additional savings in the market. "
Default87,"You misunderstand, and that might be due to how the OP worded their post. The situation you are describing does not happen. A gift of equity does not raise the price. 

In OPs situation, the fair market value is $125k. A gift of equity of $10k would mean they are purchasing it for $115k. 

Accepting the gift of equity can not raise the OPs costs by definition."
Default87,"If all your savings is about $8k, then you absolutely aren’t ready to buy a house. That is not even enough for the 6 month emergency fund that you want/need when buying a house. 

Sign another year lease. Spend the next 18 months saving (using the good money management skills you mentioned), and revisit this discussion next year. Prove to yourself that you can do this before signing a 30 year loan."
Default87,"You should not be investing your emergency fund or short term savings. 

As for the losing to inflation thing, if that truly bothers you then you should be doing what you can to build your net worth. That way your emergency find is an ever shrinking % of your net worth, and as such the impact of that part losing to inflation becomes irrelevant. "
Default87,"No, it doesn’t not raise the asking price. 

Yes, they could use the gift of equity to reduce their own down payment and still satisfy a 20% down payment for PMI concerns, but this goes back to the previous discussion of what your goals are. If your goal is to eventually have your house paid off, putting your full down payment plus the gift of equity towards the loan will reduce your borrowed amount, which can accelerate how quickly you pay the mortgage off."
Default87,"was this house in both of your names or just yours?  if its both then this is easy, you two decide how to split up the proceeds and go your separate ways.  if its just in your name, then the profit is all yours (it doesnt matter that he has been paying the mortgage).  so you would need to gift him the money (and file the appropriate tax forms if that gift is over $15k-$60k depending on all the various marital statuses in the scenario).  if he is then turning around and purchasing another house, the new mortgage lender may request that you sign a gift letter to clarify that the money you are giving him is a gift and not a loan.

all that said, this is one of the reasons that people should not be buying houses with people they arent married to.  it adds an unnecessary level of complication to how to handle everything properly, and exposes you to a bunch of unneeded risk."
Default87,"When you get divorced there are divorce proceedings that work out the division of assets. 

You have a kid together, you are looking to buy a house together, for all intents and purposes you are married. Go to the courthouse and get the piece of paper that solidifies that reality and then proceed with your plan. "
Default87,"The grace period thing is likely the biggest key in this discussion OP. Whatever credit card that you are carrying a balance on should not be used for more purchases until you have the card paid off and the grace period reestablished. So either use a different credit card in the interim, or switch to using your debit card until this is resolved. "
Default87,"You are setting yourself up to possibly have to sell at a low market point during an emergency. 

Also, your emergency fund should be an ever shrinking portion of your overall net worth, so the fact that it isn’t earning much by sitting in a HYSA isn’t relevant. "

But seriously, you should get married before you do this. You already are married and just don’t have the legal protections that come with it, so go get that piece of paper. "
Default87,"Did you get this financial advisor from listening to Dave Ramsey?  If so, any investing you are doing with them is likely extremely expensive and not worth it. 

As for your 401k investments, if you don’t understand investing enough to be able to pick your own funds, see if your plan has target date funds available, and just invest everything into the fund that matches closest with your expected retirement year."
Default87,"I am not sure why you are concerned about this. You can look at the 401k you have access to and evaluate the investments that are available. If you like the options, then there isn’t anything to be worried about."
Default87,"Typically it’s not an emergency if you are able to delay it a whole lot for that to matter. And if you are able to delay it, while it’s being delayed you should be saving money out of your monthly cash flow to pay for it. "
Default87,"so you have $16.5k in unsecured debt, $3k of debt to the government (not sure what you mean by overpayment, is this back taxes?), and $20k of secured debt in your car.

bankruptcy likely wont clear out the $3k in government debt.  it could get rid of your $16.5k in unsecured debt, and the only way it will clear the car is if you get rid of the car.

generally, it is not a good idea to declare bankruptcy on such a small amount of debt, as its going to cost you a few thousand dollars just to file bankruptcy, you will trash your credit for the better part of a decade, and will likely be put on a payment plan so its not like you just get out from having to pay anything.

so if I were you , I would look at selling the car and buying a cheap car in cash to get around in.  Then I would stop trying to rationalize bad purchases by claiming wants as needs (you may have needed **a** laptop, but you likely did not need **that** laptop).

you have $750 in expenses listed, adding in some more money to cover gas and food, you are looking at maybe $1100/mo in expenses.  that means even in your bad months of only bringing in $1600, you still have $500/mo to put towards debt.  I would stop paying anything towards any debts that are already in collections.  I would pay minimums towards all my other current debts, and then start throwing any extra money towards the government debt first.

I would also look at what I could do for a second job to start bringing more money in each month.  every extra dollar earned in a second job goes directly towards paying your debt off.

so no, you arent bankrupt, you are just in a shitty situation.  but it is a solvable situation none the less."
Default87,"Take the job, apply the extra ~$42k/year after taxes towards her loans, and pay the debt off in under 5 years.

She took out all of those loans under the assumption she would pay them back. She now has an opportunity for a great salary from that education she received from those loans, so she now can pay them back easily. "
Default87,"your mortgage lender likely take objection to this plan, as you are effectively putting 0% down on the house by financing your downpayment through your mom.  depending on the size of the house, it could impact your debt to income ratio enough to disqualify you from the mortgage.

and make sure you do not lie and say that the amount your mom is giving you is a gift when its actually a loan, as that is fraud."
Default87,"the estimated tax return number that is given is not accurate until you have fully completed your tax filing.  if you dont know much about taxes, you should pretty much ignore it until the end (or hire someone  to do your taxes for you to make sure they are done right).  if you do know a good bit about taxes, it can be used as a sanity check to make sure you are filling your taxes correctly."
Default87,"if you have any planned expenses that can be routed through your FSA, do so, as you are only spending approximately 70 cents to get a dollars worth of goods/service.

if you dont have planned expenses, you can see if your plan allows for dollars to roll over from year to year.  if it does, it wouldnt be the worst idea to put in up to what can be rolled over as an emergency fund, assuming you already have an emergency fund and are out of high interest debt."
Default87,"It’s not bad, but your credit card holder will likely close the accounts due to inactivity after a while. 

An easy way to avoid this is to put a small, recurring item like a Netflix subscription on any card that you don’t use daily and set the card to be auto paid in full each month. Keeps the card active, but reduces the amount of time you need to spend to manage them. "
Default87,"Life insurance is there for two primary cases, someone depends on your income to live or someone has co-signed a debt for you. 

In the case of a co-signed debt, you want enough insurance to cover the remaining debt if you were to die, and you want the term length to match up fairly closely with when the debt is expected to be paid off. 

For the case where someone depends on your income, the first thing you have to do is determine if you are already self insured. If you have $10m in an investment account, your family will be fine if you died, so life insurance becomes and unnecessary expense.  If you aren’t self insured, you want enough insurance so that the payout can be invested and the person can draw off of it to replace some or all of your income. General recommendation is to get about 12 times you annual income in term life insurance. 

The length of the term is influenced by a few things. It only needs to last until you expect to be self insured, so if you are forecasting out your savings, and see that 12 years from now you should have $2m which will be enough for your family, then getting a 10-15 year policy is a good idea. If you just had a kid and you want to cover until they are through college then a 25 year term would be appropriate. If you are more conservative and want to cover your entire working career, that’s where 30+year term policies come into the picture. "
aceman97,"Don’t do it. I know your heart is in a good place but don’t do it. You must let her sort it out. Keep emphasizing that it will impact her future and potentially your future if she keeps doing this. If you pay it for her, you’ll just enable her more. Bad idea."
aceman97,"Your 457 is similar to a 401k. Assuming you continue to contribute 400 dollars to your 457 over your investment lifetime, you’ll have the following amounts:

I assumed you are 28 years old and you retire at 65 and you don’t currently have anything saved:

@7% return = 1.69 million

@6% return = 1.23 million

@5% return = 898,000

Assuming you did the 4% rule, you would be able to take out the following amounts per year without going broke:

67635 per year with a 7% return

49068 per year with a 6% return

35920 per year with a 5% return


The amount you contribute to your 457 matters and the fees you pay matter even more. The lesson here is to watch your fees in your 457. The difference of a 2% in fees means you’ll have almost 46% less money over your investment lifetime. Make sure you are paying the least amount possible for the best fund in your 457 and I would suggest you open a Roth IRA as well and max it out yearly. Fees are probably the most important item that will impact your long term returns. "
aceman97,"You should have a Roth IRA. The Roth 401k is still subject to required minimum distributions or RMDs at 70.5 years of age. A Roth IRA is not. Eventually you will probably move your Roth 401k to your Roth IRA to avoid the RMDs when you separate from your employer . If you can max out both, you should think about doing so. Also think about what you are paying in tax now vs taxes when you retire. "
aceman97,"Let’s say you max out your pretax contributions this year. You get the full company match and let’s say at your company it’s 6k. You would have put 19k in as pretax or Roth 401k and the company’s match at 6k for a total of 25k. The yearly limit is 56k on 401ks:

56k -19k -6k = 31k

If your plan allows it, you can still contribute an extra 31k to your 401k in after tax contributions. These are funds that taxes have been taken out but you opted to save. Now there is no tax benefit to doing this. However if your plan allows it, you can take the 31k and move it to your Roth IRA through what’s called an “in service withdrawal”. This “in service withdrawal” allows you to move an extra 31k into your Roth IRA per year. THIS IS HUGE!!!!!! This doesn’t impact your normal Roth IRA contribution of 6k. So assuming you did both you could contribute a full 37k into your Roth IRA in one year. 31k from the mega backdoor process (“in service withdrawals”) and 6k of normal contributions provided you don’t hit income limits on the Roth. However if you do hit income limits you could still do the backdoor IRA process and still get the 6k in your Roth. Do not confuse the backdoor Roth IRA procedure with the mega backdoor Roth IRA procedure. These are two separate things.

Backdoor IRA: this is when you make too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA directly. You then open a Traditional IRA -&gt; make a contribution of 6k -&gt; wait 3 business days -&gt; roll it over to your Roth IRA. 

Mega backdoor IRA: this is there you make after tax contributions to your 401k then do “in service withdrawals” to your Roth IRA.

Hope this helps!"
aceman97,"It depends on whether you want to save tax dollars now or later and fees. I would use the following requirements:

1) do I want to save on taxes now?  Yes. Place money in 401k. You’ll be able to deduct any money you place into your 401k from your taxable income but you’ll pay taxes on your gains later in retirement.

2) do you want to save on taxes later? Yes. Place your 6k contribution into your Roth IRA through your backdoor Roth IRA. Once in your Roth IRA you won’t pay taxes on withdrawals later in life.

Now the key here is to make sure you don’t have a shitty 401k plan with super high fees. What’s a high fee? Anything above .2%. If all your funds charge over .5%, then you probably have a bad plan."
aceman97,"If you do married filing separately:

Total income 45500

Taxable: 45500 - 12000 = 33500

@12% = 33500 - 9526 = 23974 * .12 = 2877

@10% = 9525 - 0 = 9525 * .10 = 953

Total tax = 2877 + 953 = 3830

Total tax due = 3830 - 2000 (CTC) = 1830

You should get back your withholding-1830. Looks like marrried filing jointly is the better path."
aceman97,Your taxes are going to be around 13100. This assumes that you only had the standard deduction and did not contribute to a 401k or Traditional IRA. Go look at your December 2018 paystub and see how much withholding they took out. That will give you an idea of how much you’ll get back or owe.
aceman97,"The most apartment you can afford is 650 a month. Take your monthly income and multiply by .28. This is just a general rule of thumb. Anything above that will probably end up stressing your finances. What happens if you guys break up? How will you handle the apartment?  Make sure you are both are on the lease. Did you account for your subscriptions (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc)?"
aceman97,"I would pay off your debt first and then start looking at your house options. Since you have 53k in savings I would say your budget is:

93k x2.5 = 232,500 + what ever savings you may have. In your case:

232,500 + 53,000 = 285,500  (max budget)

Now once you pay off that debt, that number will come down a little. You don’t have any numbers listed for retirement? Are you guys saving for retirement? If you aren’t, you should be. You should be saving 20% of your income for retirement. Good luck!"
aceman97,"Buy a broad US based total market index fund. I’m not familiar with Chase’s options in terms of what kinds of securities you can buy. I would highly recommend Vanguard or Fidelity or Schwab to open a Roth IRA. If you can, buy the following type of funds or their Chase equivalents: VTSAX or FZROX or VTI or ITOT or SCHB.  Since you are just starting out, ITOT is a really good choice as it’s 59 dollars a share and zero commissions when you buy through Fidelity.  Always look at the fees that Chase is charging. Fees will have a profound impact on your retirement savings."

Keep in mind it’s a general rule of thumb. Doesn’t mean it will work for you based on your location and income. However you’ll probably be house poor if you decide to ignore that guidance.  Let’s assume you decide to ignore it and go up to 35% of your income on a house. The typical breakdown for your monthly income would look like this.

25% going to taxes (Fed, state, Social Security, Medicaré)

15% toward retirement 

35% going to Housing

10% going to your car

That’s leaves 15% of your salary for everything else. Even if you don’t have a car. 25% to live off and three items are eating up 75% of your income."
aceman97,"I don’t follow. When you buy the house, if only one of you is on the mortgage, that person is solely responsible for all taxes and mortgage on the home. As far as getting to write off the taxes, you’ll be able to deduct up to 10k in property taxes and any interest that you pay on the house. When you get married, same rules apply. The best thing to do is to get married so you can claim married filing jointly. The benefit here is that your tax brackets are larger (e.g.):

MFJ:

10% 0 to 19400

12% 19401 to 78950

22% 78951 to 168400

Single:

10% 0 to 9700

12% 9700 to 39475

22% 39476 to 84200

As you can see, the quicker you get married the more you’ll save on taxes.  Depending on the cost of your house, it may not be advantageous to itemize vs just taking the standard deduction 

FYI. Filing married filing separately is even worse as most of your deductions are capped."

At the end of the day, it comes down to what you would rather do with the money. I would rather earn 7%. To each their own."
aceman97,You probably could have refinanced 3 months after you initially took out the loan. The credit union or bank should have seen that you had some payment history and they would have reworked the loan. When I was 18 my buddy bought a Chevy pickup and got a 24% loan. He went to his credit union three days later and got a 9% loan with zero credit history. I’m sorry you got robbed in this experience. Chalk it up to a lesson and don’t repeat it. 
aceman97,"Yes. Since it’s a taxable account. She won’t be able to roll it into a Roth IRA. She’ll need to roll it into a taxable account. The primary point of a UTMA account is to provide for education or transfer wealth to your child. I’m using it to transfer wealth, albeit a small amount, to get my children started with investing and money management. At 18, they could blow it or they could continue to be prudent with the money. It’s on them. No guarantees."
aceman97,"You should invest it. Paying off a depreciable asset is never a good idea. You may save 1200 bucks in interest but what is the lost opportunity cost? I’ll assume you are 28, if you pay the 9k on the car and pay it off , your opportunity cost is 303k.  You saved 1200 bucks in interest but lost a potential 303k. "
aceman97,"One thing I started doing was I would have a “No Spend day” once a week. The only goal was to not spend for a single day. Every other week I would increase it by a day.  I eventually grew it to a “no spend week”. The next thing I did was a “no spend pay cycle”. In my case, I could not spend any money for 15 days. It was really hard as I had terrible spending habits. Once I made it a pay cycle, I finally broke my cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. It felt good to have almost an entire paycheck sitting in my checking account. I used that feeling to build on that. 

I moved on to my next problem, how do I save the money. I opened a Roth IRA and I started to put 1% of my gross income per month  into it. Every month I would increase that number by 1%. My goal was to get to 20% of my gross income saved per month. After about 10 months, I pulled the rip cord and jumped my savings to 25% of my gross income would go to my 401k and Roth IRA. 

It will take some time to get used to it but set a small goal and build from there. Save 1% of your monthly income and don’t spend for 1 day. Build on that.  Anything you want to buy, put a 72 hour rule on. You have think it over for 72 hours. Start there."
aceman97,Do it. You have to keep in mind that time matters in investing. The sooner you do it the more your money is potentially worth. After you leave your current job you can always roll over the 401k to a Rollover IRA or to your new 401k if they allow it.
DiggingNoMore,"No problem.  So we have a different spreadsheet file for each year.  And then a different worksheet for each month.

Each worksheet looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/ZWkqGIt

It's ugly, but I whipped it up in like two seconds.  That would be an example of what part of a particular month would look like.

So there is a table like that (with a lot more categories, those are just some examples), for every month.  Then we write down the date, who was paid, how it was paid, and then the amount that was paid in the right category.

We have the notes column because it's not always obvious what the purchase was.  If it's money under ""Gasoline"", then you obviously put gas in your tank, for example, so no need to use the notes column.  But other ones might need more of a description.

And if we have a shopping trip that happens to be in more than one category, like buying groceries at Walmart but also buying some office supplies while you're there, we just use the receipt to determine how much to put in each column."
DiggingNoMore,"That's not a great plan, unless you're in poor health.  I pay $165/year for $300k coverage and I'm mid-30s.

You also don't have any kids, so there really isn't much of a reason for you to have life insurance anyway."
DiggingNoMore,"It's a Health Savings Account.  You may have access to one if you have a High Deductible Health Plan from your (or your spouse's) employer health insurance.

It allows you to pay for medical expenses using pre-tax dollars, so that saves you 10-20% or whatever your income tax would be."
DiggingNoMore,"Without any details, you're just going to get generic advice.  And here it is.  Create an emergency fund if you don't have one.  This should be big enough to handle short-term problems, like the moving you speak of.

If you already have that, you can invest in your 401k to get the match.

Already doing that?  Pay extra on your high-interest debts, starting with the one with the highest interest.

No debt?  Then it depends on your goals.  Early retirement?  Save more there.  Home ownership?  Save for 20% down.  And so on, depending on your goals in life."
Welledone,"The risk you run, as you mentioned, is that the fund, target date or VTSAX, experiences losses during the year. That’d result in having less than the Roth max to contribute, at least from that source, in January 2020. 

No risk of that with the HYSA but also no upside if the market moves higher over the year. 

You would pay capital gains at your marginal tax rate for funds held less than one year. "

Once you're enlisted, if you select the new new retirement plan, you'll definitely want to max out any matching into your Thrift Savings Plan, but other than that, I would just plow every extra dollar into your debt (after setting up an emergency fund).

In addition, you can withdraw any *contributions* (not earnings) made directly into a Roth IRA without penalty.

I would recommend just saving up the money separately, though.

chefddog,"You will have taken a ding, but it's part of the process when you have a new credit file.  You should be able to rebound.

On another note:  Have you looked at your credit report? It's possible there is some negative information on there that kept you from getting a card also.   

You can get a free report from [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com) or even Credit Karma (although their scoring should be ignored as virtually no lender using Vantage scoring)."
chefddog,"Thing is you can not predict the future.  Right now it doesn't seem like it's needed, but things can take a turn very quickly.  All the sudden your parents are not an option.   Before you know it you have an SO, a kid and a mortgage.  Much easier to bump up to a $12K e-fund when you already have $7500 there than starting from scratch."
chefddog,"Then only give them a set amount (same for each kid) for entertainment/expenses.  Let her figure out how to budget.

ETA - my sister did a similar system to what we grew up on. All the kids got the same amount of money.  One daughter was a spender, son a saver other daughter was in between.  Son saved up enough for a spring break in CO. Spender daughter was upset and said it was unfair he got to go away.  Then my sister pointed out all the crap she bought throughout the year.     It was a real eye-opener for her."
chefddog,"Pay yourself first.   10% would be ideal, but if you need to do less, so be it.  Even $25 per month will give you $300 a year.    I find it easier to save a certain amount each paycheck go toward savings.  So if you get paid say every other week that would be $12.50 a pay check.  That seems doable.   After a while you might find you can bump that up to $15 a paycheck.   If you get a raise up your savings a little. Eventually you want to increase the percentage, but it might be a little while with your income.   If you keep up this habit it will become second nature."
chefddog,"Whatever your budget can afford, but I would start with the following:  Make adjustments based on your social groups tastes.

1 Red wine,1 white wine.  Light beer, craft beer.  Vodka, Whiskey (Jack or Jim or something similar), rum, tequila. 

Mixers coke, diet coke, 7up, club soda, tonic, sour mix, water. Lemons, limes.

I've worked plenty of weddings and most people will find something to drink from the above list.  Sure they might have preferences on brand or even drink, but if it's not there they still find something to drink.

I'm not sure the laws in CA, but we brought in our own alcohol for our wedding in NJ and were able to return any unopened bottles."

chefddog,"You can sometimes negotiate a higher payout, but not as an excuse for covering your loan.  It doesn't work that way.  The car is worth what it's worth.  Loans have no baring on the car's worth.  Sure insurance companies will try to pay out the least, so do your homework.  Run the numbers through Kelly Blue book and Edmunds to get an ideal what the car is worth.

It's doubtful you will get the car loan company to negotiate either.  You borrowed 'x' amount of money and they want that amount back. "
chefddog,"Using it to buy things outside your budget.  Lots of people get themselves in trouble that way.

Don't get me wrong, they have good intentions.  The minimum payments looks easy enough to handle.  The problem is interest starts adding up quickly. Then they start using the card more and more and before they know it the minimum is now in the hundreds and they barely can cover the payment let alone pay off the debt itself."
BethlehemShooter,"I think if the car has been officially labelled a lemon under the states lemon law you wont be able to get a loan on it.

Have you looked into what your rights were? They may not have informed you properly....."
BethlehemShooter,"Be forewarned, though, that if you have a 401K loan balance and you leave the company, the loan becomes immediately payable. If you dont pay it back, the balance unpaid becomes an early withdrawal and becomes taxable and subject to a 10% penalty tax."
BethlehemShooter,"Who is paying the car loan now?
If the car is in your name but the loan has 2 names, refinance.
Go to the Bank of America web site and you will find car loan refinancing available.

Technically, if you are burning bridges with your Mom. You can tell her that if she doesnt hand over the car you could report it stolen and tell the police where to find it. Personally,  I wouldnt do this, but technically it is within your rights."
BethlehemShooter,"A 2 minute commute is abnormal.

How many miles is the new trip each way?
Are you able to work from home any days?

What price if gasoline are you assuming?

Assuming 50 miles each way you are at 2,000 miles per month.

At 27 mph, 2,000 miles/month is roughly 75 gallons of gasoline per month. Even at $3/gallon, that is only $225 per month.

I don't see how you come close to a $400 a month estimated cost.

My personal view: drive the Camry until making repairs on it no longer makes economic sense."
BethlehemShooter,"It is dubious that he could deduct the car payment,  as you noted. He would have to pay employer-side social security tax in the income, and he would have to pay enough pretax to make the after-tax payment, which would 50% more than the payment itself."
BethlehemShooter,"How much cash is left over each month after paying everything?

You dont have any ""bad"" debt.

How much do you think you will need for the downpayment? With the $25K in savings how much more do you need.

For example: you need $60,000 downpayment in 24 months so you need to save $35,000 in 24 months. Thus allocate $1,500 a month toward saving for that.

If I read right, you have $6,000 a month left over, so after that $1,500 you still have $4,500 a month left over.

Anything else save up in a separate account until you can completely pay off your smallest debt (i.e. the small car loan first).

You're doing great.

"
BethlehemShooter,"Just NO.

What is your interest rate? Your student loan interest is tax deductible perhaps.

The 401k/IRA withdrawal is a taxable event.

After the tax refund, your balance will be down to $3,000. The interest expense on $3,000 is no reason to blow up your retirement savings.

How much can you afford to pay per month?
"
BethlehemShooter,"So given 2 years in the field, you had a 14 month job and a 10 month job. You describe the current job in very positive terms.

I guess my question is this: Are you still learning new things on your current position? If so, I would say stay.

If not, I would say consider what the impact on your resume is from creating a series of jobs with short tenure. In general, I think, companies want to hire people who will stick around for a while, not someone that will jump ship quickly.

So my question is: within your field, did the current job represent an increase in your level of responsibility?

I guess it never hurts to put yourself out there, but only look at jobs that represent a step change increase in the level of responsibility that the new position represents.

GL

Edit: the point of a resume with short tenure jobs is a feature on your resume, it's a red flag for new companies. Also take into consideration opportunities for advancement where you are,  both within HR and outside HR."
BethlehemShooter,"2,100 miles a month at 30mpg = 70 gallons @ $3/gallon = $210/month

Oil change at $70/per every other month is $35/month.

Tires. $900 for four lasting 63,000 miles at 2,100 miles a month = 30 months = $350 a month

$210 + $35 + $30 = $275/mo.

Maintenance. Yeah. Lumpy. Part of the cost of owning a car.

Net net lots of cash flowing to the car.

That's my take, how I would view it. Anyone can have their own view based on their own assumptions.

Cheers."
BethlehemShooter,"I think that sounds right but I remain uncertain. So leys say you put in $5,000 and over 5 years you did really well and it got to $10,000. You are saying the original $5,000 can be withdrawn tax free, but the rest would be subject to the 59 1/2 age limit.

If you took that out, what would the tax owed be more than the 10% early withdrawal penalty given that it is a Roth?"
Greenappleflavor,"Make sure you get something in writing. You don’t want to damper the relationship just in case down the line anything happens on either end.

Also even though it’s 1% (after you graduate or as you borrow?) you want to make sure you’re diligent about paying him back because it’s different when you borrow from family or friends vs the a third party with no attachment."
Greenappleflavor,"&gt;&gt; Just be easier to pay in payments so i don't spend it all at once.

This actually allows you to spend more than you should.

I would steer clear from it because it’s similar to paying on a credit card with 0% interest for x months. You then suddenly have more in your bank to spend rather then paying off the item...

"
Greenappleflavor,"If you signed up via paper you can request for the original docs and if it’s was roth versus traditional and opened incorrectly it’s on them to fix it.

But if he had sent you an app and it was for traditional versus roth and you filled it out and signed it with that fact there (trad vs roth) you might be SOL.

If it’s opened online I’m not quite sure how the broker could have messed up as you’d be the one doing the application."
Greenappleflavor,"&gt;&gt; This feels like a viscous cycle and I am being ""fed upon"" by creditors. After automatic payments and utilities and food/gas I have about $700 month to support my 2 boys.


I’m being honest here, but you have to change your mindset. You don’t make a lot of money. You make good money as an individual. You make decent money as a newly single parent with two boys.

You are also coming off with a collection that puts you in the negative, meaning, your first priority is to take care of the debts... the faster the better, the less interest you’ll pay.

You also need to put a freeze on your credit as another user suggested, alongside requesting to see what’s on your report and start dispute process with any you don’t recognize.

Don’t worry about credit so much right now, you should rework your budget, and cut out what fat you can. Find a way to get yourself back in the black, with an emergency fund, before you feel like you can splurge $20 on something that’s not essential (and generic version of that, Eg forget brand names)."
Greenappleflavor,"Cheapskate is someone who will only order an appetizer but sample from everyone else’s meal, never picks up the tab when the office goes out drinking and will essentially save money off of someone else back.

Frugal is when you only go out on special occasions, reuse items or figure ways out to save money without piggy backing on someone else’s tab and a lot of it has to do with couponing and DIY projects."
Greenappleflavor,"Your post is the exact opposite of what one is suppose to do with credit utilization and credit score.

However whichever friend convinced you so, probably is reaping in the rewards as you’re trying to spend the 30-40% on your credit cards limit."
Greenappleflavor,"And make sure you follow up!! If you make a call to inquire (after read receipt of email, I forgot that in my original post, or confirmation of delivery from certified mail), write down the day, time and person you spoke with and in as much detail as possible, what was said. Keep diligent with the details and make sure when you’re talking to the dentist, or the office manager, that you repeat what they say and ask for confirmation in form of:

“Okay, so to summarize..... is that correct (insert person’s name here)? I just want to make sure I get this absolutely correct, thank you”.

Don’t let it go too long. I would give it a couple of weeks, a month max before letting them know of your intentions to go to the state board, in CA it’s https://www.dbc.ca.gov/consumers/complaint_followup.shtml

If you’re from another state you should have something similar set up.
"
Greenappleflavor,"If I were you I wouldn’t. 

I’d look for another job to build up a healthy savings to fund it.

I would also apply for unemployment right now, and very sparingly use the severance given, stockpiling as much away as possible—again, to fund something like that.

"
Greenappleflavor,"You misunderstand, to get a social security number you’d have to apply for one. If you say you don’t have one it’s because you are new to the US, and if that were true you’d have the paper trail for it.

Let me put it this way. I had a colleague who accidentally helped a non-US resident who had no social, apply for a credit card. The social entered in was probably a telephone, at least the area code and the first three digits of the social was same. The guy still got denied for the credit card (I don’t think he had an idea that he only could have applied with the social, which he told my then colleague he didn’t have)...probably because the info didn’t match up or whatever.

Well, a few weeks later this guy in Florida goes into the bank to apply for a credit card—appalled that in our system there is a profile and that that profile, not him, applied and got denied but has a bank account.

Long story short, my colleague was let go (he didn’t do it purposely but still) and we had to fix the issue. However, as you can see...everyone is assigned a social...the odds of you getting a number unassigned is very unlikely. And if you were to apply for one, again, it’s not that easy as you’d have to have the documentation to prove your identity before being even considered for issuing one. "
Greenappleflavor,"&gt;&gt; We got the new statement due in Feb for $453 which included our minimum payment of $403 + $25 past due + $25 late fee.

&gt;&gt; So moving forward, I confirmed with the agent on the phone, multiple times, that I needed to pay $428 ($453 - $25 late fee)

You can ask them to pull the tapes of when you spoke to this agent with, if you’ve confirmed with the agent multiple times that the payment needed is $428.

Because this:

&gt;&gt; Their explanation was that even though the $25 late fee was credited, we were still supposed to pay $453 because that was the minimum due on the statement.

Is true. And if the agent didn’t tell you that, you can try and fight this from that angle, that **you were going off of what you were told by the agent and was not made aware that you still need to pay $453**

Good luck, I had one horrible experience with BofA on a mistake they made and it took 4 hours for a $36 reversal but it was the principle. I’ve since then not had a single product to do with them and I used to work for BofA."
Greenappleflavor,"I would go with schwab or capital one.

Greenappleflavor,"He’s basically living paycheck to paycheck. He has Hulu and Netflix. One is already a luxury imho if you only have $500 in savings.  $250/month is 50-60 in groceries a week. If you’re on a rice and beans diet you can greatly lower this. Along with bagels or sliced bread with peanut butter for breakfast..you can shave down more if you buy in bulk. I used to spend only $20-25 a week in groceries.

Greenappleflavor,"First, I’m sorry you’re having to go through all of this.

She’s not the brightest bulb if she is stating this. The payroll department would have had to prepare w2 and those are typically sent to AOR.

Greenappleflavor,"Your third paragraph would be a valid explanation as to why you’re quitting if they ask—to be honest after reading your other reply (that you’ve only worked there for a week), you honestly don’t owe them anything and it doesn’t matter resume wise.

Turn in the completed work and ask for payment, then quit.

If they give you more work in the meantime, stall. Don’t do it, say you have an emergency that came up and have to go visit your great aunt out of town and you may be slow in your replies.

Greenappleflavor,"What particular aspect of banking are you interested in? There’s a world of difference between this banker: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2017-03-29/jamie-dimon-explains-how-he-became-a-banker-video

And a former banker myself (consumer, business and “private” banking).

If you’re going for the former I suggest looking at r/financialcareers

If it’s the latter, as someone who didn’t have a college degree even and worked for one of the big four banks... you’ll be fine but I would suggest pursuing to be a financial advisor over a banker in this case.

Some of the big names (Morgan Stanley, Merrill (soon to be changed if not already), Fidelity, schwab, etc... they all have programs you can join that will get you set up to be an advisor in 1-2 years.

Greenappleflavor,"Yes, manufactured spending.

Also have had people who churn too much and they’re allowed to open cards but no longer qualify for the sign up bonuses."
Greenappleflavor,"Just my two cents? Pursue what you’re passionate about. You don’t necessarily need to come out a graphics designer. You could work in the field but a different role that would be more steady with pay and still allow you to be working in a field you enjoy.

Life is too short (cliche but true) to be working towards retirement only to turn around and wonder where the last 20-30 years of your life has gone. Some things you won’t be able to do when you’re old or the experience isn’t the same regardless of how deep your pockets are.

Kevin827,"First of all, good job not being in debt.  That puts you squarely ahead of a significant amount of people.  Your spending habits looking forward should aim to continue to not be in debt.

I would consider your first goal to be establishing an emergency fund.  It doesn't have to be huge since you have a relatively stable job, but just aim for something like $3000 for now.  You can quickly open a savings account with Ally which will give you a great interest rate, park that money there, and forget about it.  You should work diligently to never touch that money unless it would prevent you from accumulating high interest debt.

Once that is squared away, you probably want to start thinking about retirement.  The typical advice is to save 10-20% of your total (pre-tax) income specifically for retirement.  The TSP is a good place for that, and you should definitely contribute at least the minimum to get the full match.  You could consider opening a Roth IRA with Vanguard, and putting the rest of your retirement investments in there (mostly since IRAs offer a lot more flexibility compared to the TSP (which is essentially a 401(k)).

If you still have money left over that you want to invest, you can certainly open up a taxable brokerage account with Vanguard, but you'll probably need $3000 to make an initial deposit.  Don't touch your emergency fund to invest it.

Starting young with regular, consistent deposits to savings and investments is the best way to go."

Kevin827,"There's so much to retirement accounts, and I just sort of re-learned something I already should have known in another comment below from [wahtisthisidonteven](https://www.reddit.com/user/wahtisthisidonteven).

So the **contributions** to a Roth IRA can be withdrawn without penalty at any time.  The earnings are a different story.  For the 401(k)/TSP, once you leave the company (or military in our cases) that is offering it, you can roll that money into a Roth IRA.  Then, I believe after 5 years, you can withdraw those contributions without a fee.  You'll have to double check me on that one.

But in my opinion, you might as well max out the Roth IRA ahead of the TSP, because then you don't have to bother with rolling it over (except the amount you contributed to it over the IRA)."
Kevin827,"&gt;As for why I am hesitant about maxing out my 401(k) is because of the guaranteed income I will be getting during retirement and how it might make more sense to use the money now where I can draw from it if I need/want to. 

This is the reason a Roth IRA would be good to fully fund each year. It saves for retirement just in case you don't make it to 20, and you can withdraw the contributions whenever you want with no penalty.  So if you make it to 20 you could withdraw what you've contributes whenever you'd like."

If it is not as much an investment as it is helping her out financially, then you need to ask yourself if you can be comfortable with never seeing that $2k again.  Whenever you loan/invest money to family and friends, and you want to maintain that relationship, it is best to think of it more as a gift than a loan.

Also, if you are in similar place financially as I was as an A1C, you probably don't have a proper emergency fund in place.  Your first concern should be to get that set up, and then you could consider giving money to your aunt."

I usually just fill out a request on their site.  They ask for current income and one or two other things, and might increase the limit immediately.  I've had some banks ask how much I want and others just increase it by how much they think is good.  It's pretty simple."

My wife and I had a few credit cards each when we got married, but we hardly touched them for the first two years or so, just because I wanted to establish good joint spending habits, and to me, using a checking account was the best way to do that.  Now we just put all those expenses on a cash back card and collect the rewards.

Don't be afraid of switching back to your old way of doing things if you find that you're having trouble keeping the card in check.

wijwijwij,"Okay, the 5% deferral from 48823 earned in 22 biweekly pay periods would be about 2441. And his 6% deferral from 69231 earned in 20 biweekly pay periods would be about 4154, so we need to subtract (2441 + 4154) from the AGI figure.

New AGI = 142054 - 2441 - 4154 = 135459

Old tax = 17601

New tax = 16150

The change in tax is 1451 because 22% of (2441 + 4154) is 1451.

New paycheck size:

(57700 – 5% of 57700)/26 = 2108  

(90000 – 6% of 90000)/26 = 3254

Withholding if S-0, S-1, S-2, S-3:

2018/biweekly (you): 272, 237, 201, 170  

3254/biweekly (him): 524, 489, 453, 418

So if you go to S-2 S-2 then overall withholding will be:

withholding = 536 Job 1 + 4422 Job 2 + 2472 Job 3 + 9060 Job 4 = 16490

That gives you a refund of 340 if your tax is really 16150.

It's still fine for you to use S-2 S-2, since the pretax deferrals are disregarded for purposes of the withholding formulas. The withholding adjusts downward automatically to account for the lower tax overall. You're still overpaying a little if you use S-2 S-2 at the new jobs (it's because fiance has been overpaying in Jan and Feb by using S-1). I think that cushion of over 300 seems like enough. But if you want even more cushion then continue at S-2 (you) and S-1 (him)."
wijwijwij,"No you won't be underpaying if you use single 2. That's exactly what you use if you don't have any special deductions or tax credits. Using 0 is taking a little too much federally.

wijwijwij,"(tax liability – amount paid so far) divided by (number of remaining paychecks) is what you'd want your goal to be per paycheck.

wijwijwij,"IRS was thinking last year of modifying the W-4 to do this: Have people use $ amounts to describe their deductions and tax credits, and figure out the withholding based on that. I haven't seen any further outcome of that draft. It got lots of criticism, especially because of privacy concerns, as it would requires an employee to list household income from all sources (including other jobs):

https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=IRS-2018-0015-0009

https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=IRS-2018-0015-0010

As you can see if you delve into the above, one of the big challenges is what to do when someone has more than one job with withholding. The above ends up doing a complicated nesting process, where amounts already written on earlier W-4s gets used on later ones. 

The reason multiple jobs is an issue is that the tax increase is marginal, so you  need to know how much income has already been earned (elsewhere perhaps) in order to know what amount of tax a new income stream will cause. That wouldn't be an issue if we had a flat tax rate that applied to all dollars earned, but we have standard deduction and various tax bracket rates."

wijwijwij,"You were 24+ at end of 2018, so your parents can't claim you as qualifying child dependent, but if they provided over half your support and your gross income was under 4150, they can claim you as qualifying relative dependent. 

This lets them get a 500 reduction in their tax. They might also get education expense tax credit like AOTC if any qualified education expenses were paid in 2018 and that credit has not been used 4 times already.

If they say you ""don't need to worry"" about filing, perhaps they mean you are not required to file. 

That's true, if your W-2 income is all your income, as you earned under 12000.

However you should file if your W-2 box 2 shows any amount at all, as that is withholding that should be refunded to you. 

Their CPA does not need to prepare your filing. You can do it yourself for free in a few minutes. Try www.irs.gov/freefile and choose any of the vendors listed there.

If you are not going to be part of the meeting with CPA and he is not going to file your taxes, he does not need your W-2. What he does need is to know your gross income is less than 4150. Also, if you received a 1098-T from school, it may be helpful for parents as they determine if there were qualifying education expenses, and you would prepare for parents info about your tuition, books, and materials if it useful for them for tax credit purposes.

Your filing will check a box near your name that says ""Someone can claim you as a dependent.""

You leave question about health insurance coverage empty because you are a dependent.

If your parents do claim you, you do not get  any tax credits. So no further refund except your wrongly withheld income tax amount.

Your parents do not need your W-2. They do not put that income on their filing.

If your W-2 box 2 is empty, then you don't actually have to file anything.

tldr: 1) Yes 2) No 3) No, but file if W-2 box 2 is nonzero and you want that refund."

wijwijwij,"If you're Single, and you'll be working one job all year, your baseline W-4 setting would be 2 allowances, and that conveys to the system that 12200 of your income won't be taxable, which is the standard deduction for a Single taxpayer in 2019. 

You could estimate your income tax for the year:

$15/hr * 40 hr/wk * 52 wk/yr = 31200  

Subtract your standard deduction to get taxable income. 

31200 – 12200 = 19000

Your taxable income gets chunked, based on tax bracket sizes, and different rates are applied to each chunk.

9700 * 10% + 9300 * 12% = 970 + 1116 = 2086

If you're paid **weekly** and your income tax is 2086 for the year, you would expect to see 2086/52 = $40.12 withheld from each paycheck. I think Arrch was giving you $160 as a monthly figure for your budget.

You'll also see 6.2% for Social Security. That's about $37.20 **weekly**.

You'll also see 1.45% for Medicare. That's about $8.70 **weekly**.

wijwijwij,"&gt;If it's under then I'm fine for the year not doing quarterlies and I can start up next year? Even if I would owe more than 1k at the end?

I realize I didn't answer this question.

If your 2018 income is under 12000, you should file to get refund of any income tax withheld, because you don't actually owe any income tax.

In this case, you do not need to do any estimated tax payments at all during 2019, even if it will turn out that your overall tax for 2019 is more than 1000.

In other words, those two ways of escaping underpayment penalty are distinct. You can escape the penalty by not having total 2019 tax greater than 1000, or you can escape it by virtue of your previous year's tax being zero. Those two things don't both have to happen together. 

Then, you'd ""start up"" doing estimated tax payments in year 2020. Because 2019 would not be a ""zero"" tax year, your calculation would involve looking at 100% of 2019 total tax and comparing it to 90% of 2020 anticipated tax, and using the lesser value as your target required annual payment in 2020. "
wijwijwij,"What amounts do your W-2 box 1 and box 2 say? 

Is this your only income for 2018? 

Are you claimed as a tax dependent by another taxpayer, such as your parents?

Answer about ""what to do next"" depends on those questions."
wijwijwij,"&gt;Is the advantages by filing separate

What are the advantages of filing separately? I did not see any mentioned.

Is it possible you misunderstood and the adviser was merely saying you two should both use the ""Married but withhold at higher Single rate"" check box on W-4? That would be a way to avoid underpaying your withholding. You would still file jointly."
wijwijwij,"&gt;There should be other options for other situations, it shouldn't assume only one earner if you're married. And if you are married, what sense does that make to have to file as withholding as a single person to have taxes withheld appropriately?

It's a tricky question. The issue is the IRS doesn't ""know"" that you are both earning incomes.

If you are both earning incomes, do you want those incomes to be treated as if they are filling up Married size tax brackets and have withholding done accordingly? That's what happens if you choose both choose ""Married"" check box. The result is your incomes get treated as if they're filling up brackets twice as roomy as the married tax brackets really are, and you underpay. That's why the adjustment is to lower allowances numbers to force more to be withheld.

I suppose you could say that the default should be that if people use ""Married"" check box, they should have withholding done as if they are Single (presuming there is not more than two jobs), and there should be another check box called ""Married but only one earner"" that could instead apply the Married tax bracket size. 

Instead, the status quo is that ""Married"" check box means ""Married and only one earner"" and the ""Married but withhold at higher Single rate"" check box means ""Married and more than one earner, or more than one W-2."" 

Either way, people would have to read the instructions."
wijwijwij,"Well, your tax with 40000 – 24400 = 15600 taxable income is about 1560, and if you add 3000 more SE income you have to think about 424 in Soc Sec and Medicare plus about 279 income taxes. 

So you want to have 1560 + ~700 withheld if you prefer to not do any ""estimated tax"" payments during the year. 

That could be achieved by conveying that your income is 7000 more. Each allowance is ""worth"" 4200, so if you subtract 2 allowances it makes your taxable income seem 8400 more. Thus, maybe you'd want to go from M-3 to M-1 to be on the safe side, and expect a small refund.  

Or you could leave your W-4 at M-3 and have wife make 4 estimated tax payments of 175 each."
wijwijwij,"Pinned in my profile is a spreadsheet you can use (or download) and play around with paycheck size and allowances to see how changing number of allowances will change amount withheld. It's based on the withholding formulas found in IRS Publication 15.

If you're married and both of you have W-2 incomes, one option is to use the www.irs.gov/w4app tool and it will give you suggestions of how to set your W-4 supposing you use the ""Married"" check box. But another option is to use the Single withholding formulas (which use tax buckets half as big) if it will cause withholding that is more in alignment with your taxation. My spreadsheet can help you forecast what the withholding would be if you do use the ""Single"" check box. Use the sheets labeled Single."
wijwijwij,"Yes. If you live all year together, and the claimed person earns under 4150, and you provide more than half their support, and they are not a qualifying child of another taxpayer, and they are not married filing jointly ...

It's called ""qualifying relative"" even though you are not related.

In this case, though, BF cannot because he did not live with her all year.

OP can claim daughter as a qualifying relative because the mother-daughter relationship is one on a list that allows this as long as they merely lived together ""more than half"" the year.

It's complicated!

Lionstar814,"You can apply for PSLF based on the 120 payments of the loans that qualify. The ones that don't just wont be forgiven with the first ones-they will have to hit 120 also. 

Whatever you do **DON""T** consolidate as that would reset **ALL** of your payments to zero. Doesn't sound like your planning to but I had to throw that out there."
Lionstar814,"If you have the check now, take it to your schools cashiering office and see if they will reissue the check.

As long as you return the original check they hopefully can reissue a new one..unless they returned the funds to your lender/source of aid."
Lionstar814,"***Question 1: Most important question - According to the PSLF Loan Repayment Plan page, it states that you can only be eligible for a PAYE plan (instead of IBR) if you received disbursement after 2011, but only if you took out loans after 2007. Because she went back to school, and consolidated the loans, is there any way she'd be eligible for the PAYE plan? I don't see an income limit - is there one for eligibility?***

I'm not 100% sure about this one. I would hate to guess.

***Question 2: Let's say she is eligible for PAYE (or for those of you reading who are) - If you are currently enrolled in the IBR plan, making eligible payments, can you switch to the PAYE plan and retain the previous on-time payment numbers going forward with the new payment amount? Or are you resetting the counter to zero when you do this?***

Switching plans DOES NOT reset the clock to zero. Consolidation does, so only her payments made since she consolidated will count towards the 120 and the loan has to be a specific type of consolidation (if you look it should say Direct Consolidation I believe).

***Question 3: Marriage (when that time comes) - With the new Tax laws, it might be harder to estimate at this point - but for the most part, did you file Married filing separately or married filing jointly? What makes either choice better in that situation? Do the new tax laws limiting property tax deductions change things?***

I am on IBR for PSLF and my wife and I file separate so they only take into account my income when determining my payment amount each year. I can't recall how the other plans look at income off the top of my head but I'm pretty sure REPAYE takes both spouses income regardless of how you file. I don't remember how PAYE works because I know I'm not eligible because of disbursement date issue (goes back to question 1).

***Question 4: Maternity Leave - How exactly does this work? Are you technically considered working full time while you are taking maternity leave? I assume after the maternity leave time allowed that she would no longer be considered full time if she extended her leave a bit.***

It really depends on what her employer says on the ECF. If she is full-time they will probably just say she is full time and works an average of 40 hours (or whatever) per work and not get into calculating it out. I don't think maternity leave itself would be an issue so much as it would be if she changed her hours per week after she went back to work to part time or something like that-that could cause a problem.

Lionstar814,"You would probably need to contact your bank and request an appraisal. They usually want to set it up themselves but have you pay for it.  Your municipal tax valuation is not going to be enough for the bank to drop PMI, but it could be a good indicator that with a proper appraisal you may be high enough to get it removed."
Lionstar814,"I switched from BofA to Ally over a year ago because I was tired of BofA too. I haven’t had any issues with Ally at all—if anything things are much easier and much better.

I can’t speak to the other online banks, but I am very happy. I have all of my accounts at Ally now although I do keep a small savings account at a local credit union in case I need to deposit cash or need brick and mortar services."
Lionstar814,"Not sure about where you can check your credit while being under 18 since as you said Credit Karma requires you to be 18 and so does Credit Sesame, but [Annualcreditreport.com](https://Annualcreditreport.com) is definitely not a scam. 

It was set up to allow people to check their credit with each of the big 3 firms once a year without paying a fee. You can choose to look at all 3 at one time or spread them out over the course of the year, but realize that each may hold different info from the others. 

Without much credit history to verify your identity, they may require you to have your reports sent in the mail as opposed to viewing them online so be prepared for that if you decide to try and check through there."
Lionstar814,"I submitted my repayment plan paperwork during the shutdown as well as my wife's without issue so I'm thinking there is something else going on. As others have suggested, you should contact your loan service company and find out what is going on."
Lionstar814,"This is from my banks FAQ about PMI...this law covers everyone in the US I imagine:

The Homeowners Protection Act and applicable state, federal and investor guidelines outline the requirements to cancel your PMI. They vary depending on your type of loan. If you would like us to cancel your PMI early, please call us at XXX or send a written request to the address or fax number above. We’ll send you a letter with the requirements for cancellation. After you’ve completed them, we’ll let you know within approximately 30 days if we can cancel your PMI. 

&amp;#x200B;

and this...

The Homeowner's Protection Act of 1998 allows a borrower to cancel Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) under certain conditions. If the loan payments are current, you can cancel PMI for single-family, single-unit or owner-occupied properties when the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio reaches 78% based on the initial amortization schedule. The Act applies only to loans that originated on or after July 29, 1999. In some circumstances, the Act may allow a borrower to cancel PMI before the loan reaches 78% LTV.  "
Lionstar814,I actually use Ally for my savings as well as my checking/debit. I keep a small savings at my credit union Incase I need a cashiers check or if I need to deposit cash or use the coin machine in the lobby.
Lionstar814,"IBR will allow you to file separately and not count the spouses income, but most if not all of the other IDR plans will count the spouses income regardless of how you file.

I file MFS because of my loans being eligible for PSLF and I try to keep the payment low. I am on IBR and her income is not counted in the calculations of my payments.

It really depends on what plan you are on or are eligible to switch too, as they have specific requirements as far as original disbursement dates and stuff."
Lionstar814,I would check with the clerks office when they open. Some states would consider you legally married as long as the ceremony was conducted and the license signed and dated before the expiration. Your local clerk is the best place to get an answer to this as each state has different laws that govern this stuff and what happens in a scenario such as yours. Good Luck and congrats!
Lionstar814,"&gt; My husband is not on my account 

That's the reason right there. They put up signs in the bank to say this also (at least my local BofA did when I still banked there). Most banks have moved to a policy similar to this so you may have issues finding one that doesn't.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;"
Lionstar814,"I don't think what your want to do is possible without making multiple accounts.

Having said that, I use Ally and can make multiple accounts (savings or checking) and there are no fees or minimums. I believe CapitalOne 360 and Discover offer the same availability but I can't say for sure as I don't use those. 

Anyway, it may be worthwhile to look at an online bank. Even if your not looking to move online with everything, this could allow you to have different accounts for different goals and needs without requiring minimum balances or direct deposits to avoid fees."
Lionstar814,"I switched from BofA over a year ago to Ally and have been VERY happy. Having said that, I do keep a small account at my local credit union for in person stuff if i ever need it or for cash deposits (which I never have).

Most credit unions have a membership requirement, but mine is just to live in a county where they have a branch. Some are employer based (you work for x employer, you can join). Check with the ones in your area to see what, if any, requirements they have if you are interested in going that route.

Either one, online or credit union, is going to offer better rates than one of the big banks and probably less or no fees."

Lionstar814,"Retirement Funding Question My wife and I are both in our mid-40's. I work in government and have a defined benefit pension that upon retirement will pay 78% of my annual income, which I estimate at the time of my retirement will be about $72k/yr. If I can tolerate it, I can hang out 4 more years and bump that to about 90%. I am also eligible for deferred retirement where I continue to work for 5 years after electing to retire and they deposit the retirement money into an account on my behalf each month, which I get at the end of 5 years and should total about $350k. During that 5 years I would still earn my normal paycheck and benefits. After the 5 years I would start collecting my retirement checks monthly and really be retired.

In addition to all of this, I have a 457(b) that I can contribute to, but there is no matching for it. My wife works but has no retirement plan available right now so we are opening a Roth IRA in her name.

&amp;#x200B;

So..the questions I have are should I also open a Roth IRA for myself also, and if so which of my accounts should I prioritize (the 457 or the IRA)?

I know I can technically do both (and max my wife's IRA), but due to a finite amount of money being available and other bills to pay I am trying to figure out where I should put my focus.

If I can follow through with all of the above options as far as staying to achieve the 90% and the extra 5 years for the deferred retirement, I would be about 57 1/2 when all is said and done. I point this out because one of the big benefits to a 457(b) is taking the money out without penalty if I leave my job before 59 1/2. "
whiteraven4,"What exactly was your relative talking about? There's a fixed number of green cards per country per year. But that has nothing to do with you initially moving to the US and doesn't matter for nearly all countries. I've never heard of a country limit for an H1B so unless you have some kind of actual information on that, I'm not inclined to believe it. And I'd really like to understand what your relative was talking about so I can learn if there's something I'm mistaken by. And when I google for it, the only information I find on per country quotas relates to green cards.

Other information about the H1B, your employer (you can't apply for it) must apply for it in April and if you manage to get one, then you can start working in October. So depending on when exactly you want to move, you may have less time than you think.

I think you're severely underestimating how difficult it is to immigrate to the US and any plan you have needs to take into account that it is a lottery. If you go in with the mindset that you're guaranteed a visa with a job offer, you'll potentially end up disappointed and possibly in a bad financial situation if you don't plan correctly. If anything, the current administration wants to make it harder to get an H1B.

Maybe I'm wrong and like I said, I'd love to learn more if I am."

There's also the potential savings of her being able to do more to save money at home, like cooking more. Since you don't mention it, I'm assuming you guys aren't and wont have to pay for daycare?

The 7% is due to you needing to also pay the half of FICA that your employer normally pays."

Right.. that's pretty much what I'm saying should be included in the $500 max if you go to a place that'll get one from a pick/pull. Modern cars don't need a paint job since the paint rarely fades. 

Insurance will replace parts with new parts. If you pay for it yourself you can put a used bumper on there and it should be a lot less then $1k for your deductible. 

I totaled my first car in a ditch. It had a lot of underbody work and insurance paid out $8k and we bought it back for like $250 and my dad and I repaired it for like $3k and $1k to repaint. Insurance won't cover the used parts but it beats paying more and having your rates go up"

That said if you want a Subaru then get it outside of Denver and either ship it or drive it here.

In my head, I'm jumping up and down. I've had a hard time filling this roll. So then I say.. Great.. We love you so lets make it $85k. Both sides are happy right?

What if I told you I was willing to start at $95k? So you just lost $10k by telling me how much you wanted to make. So even if you suck at negotiating, you just lost out on $10k. 

The fun fact is that $10k snowballs. Your next job you give up your number and you are happy with $90k but you were at $95k and the other job offered $115k. So you can see it snowballs.

akkruse,"You could obviously pull cash out of the old bank and deposit it into the new account, but I'm assuming you don't want to do that (maybe it's a decent chunk of money). You could probably withdraw your funds as a cashier's check for a small fee, which would be essentially the same as withdrawing cash but you wouldn't have to leave carrying a suitcase full of money. For that matter, if you have paper checks with your old bank, you could just write yourself a personal check and deposit it into your new bank account.

If you both accounts open at the same time (ex. old account isn't closed immediately when new account is opened), you could probably go online and add your old bank as an ""external bank account"" to your new bank account, then just transfer the money (it would be an EFT transfer). This shouldn't cost you any money. You could also probably do a wire transfer, which would be quicker but would cost you money.

Some banks will also handle everything for you if you want (ex. you could call the new bank and ask if they do this), but you might be better off doing it yourself so you don't end up in a situation where you have missing money and each bank says the other bank has it."
akkruse,"Sent in increments until the 24th? Your $3500 check broke the bank haha... as a side-note, I personally would not be ok with my bank doing this (as in this would make me seriously consider changing banks). Not only are they not giving you access to your cash, I would also assume they're earning interest for themselves using your funds."
akkruse,"From what I remember, Cobra wasn't worth considering... I forget why exactly, but I think it was expensive and you didn't get much. If you (or your family) have regular monthly prescriptions, talk to your doctor about the situation while you still have insurance and they might be able to work with you. You might be able to do a mail-in thing to get three months worth at once. But if you guys don't have regular monthly prescriptions, then none of this is an issue. You didn't give much into as to what exactly you're concerned about (prescriptions, the possibility of getting sick, possible emergency, etc.)."
akkruse,"I feel like the majority of the people that have responded only read the title and not the rest of your post. Your question is does it make sense to redeem for cash *to cover unexpected debt*, not if it's the best option for redeeming in general.

I would say you know best, and to be logical. How much is the debt? If you don't redeem your points, then what happens... does it get financed on a credit card at 20%? If so, then it's probably best to redeem the points. If the debt isn't that much, on the other hand, and you could manage by cutting back on other expenses in the meantime, then maybe it makes more sense to do that. I think it depends on your particular situation."
akkruse,"Yes, if it's not costing you money (no annual fee) then you want to leave it open to help your credit. It will add to your overall number of accounts, line of credit, and age of accounts. In the US, all of these things help improve your score."
akkruse,"With an online savings account, you can usually also get a checking account with a debit card, giving you instant access to cash from ATMs. It might not be the best option (pulling out $1000 in 20's at CVS is kind of awkward), but better than 3-5 days."
akkruse,"Also, I believe Chase only asks for your name and date of birth. It's kind of crazy to me that Chase makes it so easy to add an authorized user, then that person has to jump through hoops to get removed. "
akkruse,"I'm not sure on that to be honest. You could always call them and ask. If it is possible to remove her, I would imagine you'd probably have to call in anyways to do it. If they can remove her, I would also be sure to ask if they have to check your credit first (which would be a hard pull on your report). I guess it wouldn't be a huge deal if they had to, but if having her on the account isn't a problem for her, I personally probably wouldn't bother (I'd rather save a hard pull for a new account)."
akkruse,"To add to what others have already said, it might be worth mentioning that if you ask for an increase, they'll likely have to check your credit before they make a decision. Since you said this card is 8 months old and you have another that is only a few weeks old, that tells me you probably already have at least two hard inquiries on your report within the last year. If you ask for an increase and get another hard inquiry, that might start having a negative impact on your credit score. If you just wait for them to give you an increase without you asking, they shouldn't check your credit.

Also, I'm not sure how Capital One does things, but I know every once in a while Chase will ask me to update my income information, which I'm assuming they use to determine if they should give me an increase (so if you get an email like this, you might not want to ignore it)."
akkruse,"I'm not sure, you could probably call the number on the card to find out. On one hand I wouldn't see them going out of their way to give you money, but then again maybe they want to get it off their books."
akkruse,"Your statement should be generated after the auto-payment, that's the only way it could reflect the payment. Example, one of my cards has a due date of the 17th and the statement date is the 20th. It might also be worth mentioning that I could have everything paid in full by the due date (the 17th) but then any new charges on the 18th or 19th could still be on my next statement. If you want a zero-dollar statement balance, pay your previous statement balance by the due date and make sure any remaining balance is paid by the statement date.

I'm not saying utilization is or isn't important like everyone else has already said, I'm just trying to answer your question."
akkruse,"Good job, it doesn't have to be as hard as so many people make it lol.. don't put more on it than what you can afford, pay the balance in full every month, and watch your credit build. While you don't *have* to pay in full every month (there's no penalty from the credit card company), just don't make that an option for yourself. Then, since you're not paying 20%+ interest, you can stick that money in an IRA and maybe *earn* 5-10% interest. At 18, this is literally the lifestyle difference that determines if you'll be trying to dig your way out of debt in 10 years or actually have some retirement saved up."
akkruse,"Yes, you should be able to use plans from other states, and no, you wouldn't have to file a return for that state. You'll want to look into the different options, some states are known for lower fees, some are known for higher fees, some have certain tax advantages, etc."
akkruse,"Just commenting on the title of this post. Since you didn't use any punctuation, my brain autocorrected it as I read it: ""Recently married wife's mom. Opened a credit card in her name without her consent..."" then I had to try again."
akkruse,"I don't know the answer to be honest, but even if you get taken off her card, your 4.5k out of 7k still puts you pretty well over the 30% utilization point. Granted, 64% utilization is better than 82%, but from a credit score perspective I'm not sure how much of a difference it makes (compared to the additional good history you'd be giving up)."
akkruse,"Right, which is part of why I suggested he read up on it a little bit. There are a lot of different options for different things. My main takeaway has been that saving with a 529 plan should always have a positive outcome, even in unexpected/unplanned situations."
akkruse,"I can't comment on Ally, but I did want to say you might want to consider M1 Finance. I noticed several (all?) of the things you mentioned have fees/expenses, and I believe they're all geared towards longer term investing (not frequent trading). From what I've seen, M1 might be a good match for you, as I believe it's for more long-term investing but is also free. I haven't personally used it, but have definitely been checking it out."
akkruse,"The way I understand it is you pay the 4% interest on the principle every year, meaning year one you'll pay 4% of $280k in interest. Just using random numbers as an example, if your payment for the next 30 years is $2000/month, the 4% interest on the full principle will be a big chunk of that $2000. Ten years later after you've paid some of that principle, 4% on that smaller amount will be a smaller piece of that same $2000 payment (meaning in ten years, less will be going towards interest).

I'm sure there are lots of details and specifics this leaves out, but it should give you the idea of what's going on here."
akkruse,"Compare all three of your statements and look for a transaction at the same place that's on all of the statements. That should take the guesswork out of trying to figure out where it could have happened. Since your girlfriend also had her PIN stolen, it would have had to be an ""in-person"" transaction (ex. not something purchased online, but in a store or at an ATM, in particular where the card was ran as debit and she had to enter hey PIN).

If you can't find anything in common like this, then it's probably not a skimmer or the actual card information that was stolen, but something where more general information was stolen (ex. hacked email account or something where this information could have been). However, since the info was used only an hour away, I wouldn't think it's anything too sophisticated (ex. a virus, Russian hackers, etc.).

Can't your girlfriend's bank do anything to help? If money was withdrawn from an ATM, there are usually cameras recording the people using the ATM."
akkruse,"My gut reaction was that's too much work for not enough pay, which might be the real root of the ""problem"". Granted I'm sure a lot of people would say they should be paid more, but in your case you're working 7 days a week for about $50k between two jobs. With working every day of the week, I would imagine that doesn't leave you with much extra time for ""fun stuff"". Your family might not necessarily be worried that you aren't spending enough *money* on having fun, but rather you're not spending enough *time* having fun. Spending more time on fun things doesn't necessarily have to mean also spending more money on them.

If it helps to put things into perspective, $150/month on fun stuff comes out to under $40/week, or $5/day, and accounts for just under 15% of your gross pay."
akkruse,"Then based on the article I linked, you guys should be able to use Zelle. The article says only one of the banks (sender or recipient) has to work with Zelle. Not that there's anything wrong with opening an account at Ally, but it just seems like a waste if you don't have to."
akkruse,"Explain your situation to them, tell them you were added without your knowledge/permission by someone and you don't have the account number, but you do know what accounts *should* be listed under your account (so by process of elimination, they can figure out the ""bad"" one). The ""normal"" reps can't look up accounts you're an authorized user on, but they have a security department that can.

Also, in case you aren't aware, once you are removed as an authorized user, your credit should go back to where it was. You don't have to wait years or repair the damage, it should immediately disappear as if it never happened (since you're only an authorized user)."
akkruse,"Based on this info, I would say you should open the account. There's not really any reason not to, as long as the online account doesn't have any fees (which ones like Ally don't). Why the hesitation, because you're not sure if the ""hassle"" is worth it? If so, you can set up a new account literally in 5-10 minutes. I was kind of in this same situation, but was surprised how quick and easy it really was. I should have done it way sooner, it's been really convenient and 1%+ interest is way better than 0.01%."
Cruian,"Stick with big name brands. Avoid Credit One.

Discover or Capital One both have student cards with rewards. I think I've heard BoA's student cards have good rewards, but they might be a bit pickier on who they approve.

Edit: Who is your normal bank or credit union?"
Cruian,"700 should be good for all but the very best cards, and for most loans likely in tier 2.

It could be something as simple as inquiries being different or because of your score calculation dates the utilization numbers changed."
Cruian,"The first time you buy into a mutual fund, you may have to make a minimum purchase (most Fidelity and Schwab funds don't have these anymore though). When making subsequent purchases you may also have a minimum you most buy (again, not an issue for most Fidelity and Schwab funds anymore).

For Vanguard, the initial minimum purchase of target date funds is $1,000. The initial purchase for most Vanguard Admiral level shares of index funds is $3,000 minimum. Subsequent purchases at Vanguard appear to be $1."
Cruian,"Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. Any of those 3 should be fine and are the top 3 recommended here for IRAs.

Edit: For starting under $1,000, Schwab and Fidelity have an advantage in that their mutual fund don't have minimum buy-ins."
Cruian,"Every extra penny she has that is tossed towards that card each month reduces the balance, which reduces the interest generated.

How much extra does she have per month?

With a score in the 700s, talk to some local banks and credit unions about a personal loan to pay it off. You might be able to get it to under 15% interest for a 3-5 year term. This should also eventually help her credit score instead of destroying it for 7 years."
Cruian,"I use Alliant credit union, Ally is probably the most popular here, Discover is recommended by many.

I've had to use Alliant's customer service once (I wanted to double check which debit card I was sent went with which checking account), and they were great. That also gave me a welcome call and we're able to answer some questions there. They likely will have the best interest on checking for the levels you'll keep in there with the greatest/easiest to meet conditions (0.65% only requiring one deposit from outside Alliant into the checking account each month and choosing estatements). Their website design is old but easy to use."
Cruian,"Discover and Capital One are both supposedly new cardholder friendly (which unless BoA transfers your card info is how lenders will see you), but you likely will need a job.

You could try for their basic cards if you'd like to give that a shot, or just go straight to the secured for nearly guaranteed acceptance."
Cruian,"VTSAX is probably popular because Vanguard is popular. FSTVX I believe is Fidelity's equivalent and should perform nearly the same. You could have stayed with Fidelity and just gone with the FSTVX.

If you put in $17,000 to your IRAs combined, I imagine there will be issues.

Edit: Fixed numbers
Also probably meant FSKAX"
Cruian,"Think of it as Allpoint handling the credit union's ATM business.

Actually looking at my credit union's page, the first 7 Allpoint each month are free, then $2 each (on credit union side, not Allpoint's). Which is still fine with me, I think I've only used an ATM like 7 times in my life so far.

Edit: Fixed name in first sentence"
Cruian,"Why not open an Ally checking account? That way you can at least get ATM limits immediately, or write checks. I think they refund up to $10 a month on ATM fees.

I have 2 checking accounts and my emergency Savings at Alliant, and use a local credit union with no fees for cash, maybe one month of emergency fund, and short term money holding."
Cruian,"The only reason I'm aware of to keep a 401k with an old employer would be if they offered institutional level funds which would have very low ERs. But with expense ratios as low as they are now, that probably isn't a good enough reason.

It is usually suggested to roll over to an IRA with Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard. You'll get more options and control in the IRA."
Cruian,"Utilization has no memory. If you hit 95% then pay it off to 6%, your score once the 6% is reported will act as if the 95% never happened.

Edit: Utilization only matters 1-2 months before applying for more credit."
Cruian,"Just so you are aware, the credit score that Credit Karma provides is a Vantage Score 3. It is a real score, however very few lenders actually use it in their decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

Discover or Experian can provide much more commonly used FICO 8 scores for free. No Discover card needed if you want to use that method.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: It will take about 6 months after getting a credit card to get your first score."
Cruian,"Fidelity and Schwab let you start investing in mutual funds with $1. As mentioned above, Vanguard's target date funds require $1,000 minimum buy-in while their other funds require $3,000. Under those levels and you'll have to use ETFs, which would often mean some money in your account not invested in anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Vanguard I believe has a small annual fee unless you sign up for estatements. Fidelity and Schwab I believe don't have that requirement.

&amp;#x200B;

For taxable accounts Vanguard has an advantage due to the way their mutual funds are designed."
Cruian,"Utilization is the % of the maximum limit that you use and is 30% of a score. Generally total combined utilization is most important. It is generally reported once a month, most issuers report the statement balance (a few do other times of the month).

1% - 9% utilization is ideal. Under 30% acceptable.

Because it is so heavily weighted, even small changes in utilization may significant affect a score. Having a higher total combined credit limit (used responsibly) helps  keep the utilization low and your score high.

Utilization has no memory, so it only really matters to worry about for the month or two before you apply for more credit.

Edit: Swype"
Cruian,"The fact that you don't need to pay interest isn't a secret. Plenty of people have not paid interest and have great scores.

Experian themselves (one of the 3 major credit reporting agencies) say payment history is 35% of your score: https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/infographic-what-are-the-different-scoring-ranges/

Edit: Swype..."
Cruian,"Probably a large number of people (including myself) would suggest don't. If she fails to pay, you have to pay it or your score may tank as well.

Has she applied for secured cards?

By no credit do you mean absolutely nothing? Not even student loans?

Does she have a job currently?

Edit: Spelling"
Cruian,"Do you have a separate emergency fund to cover about 6 months of expenses? If not, fund that first, it should not be invested.

&amp;#x200B;

You can open an IRA account (Roth or Traditional, based on some factors about your tax bracket now and expected at retirement) at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard and deposit $6,000 in it for 2019. Once they receive the money, you can use it to buy some mutual funds (target date or 3 fund or similar are often recommended).

&amp;#x200B;

If you have anything left over after the emergency fund and the IRA, you can open a taxable investing account and do a similar thing there."
Cruian,"I'd hold off on a second card until your first hits a year. Better cards become available then.

For long term building, you don't need to make payments immediately. You can let a statement generate and just pay it all at once (as long as you don't go over the limit).

The limit doesn't matter directly, it usually matters indirectly by lowering utilization. Utilization has no memory, so you can ignore that up until 2 months before you need to use your score for another card or loan.

Asking Capital One for a credit line increase is only a soft pull, you could try asking now, if not, you may have to wait.

Edit: Swype"
Cruian,"Credit scores and how credit cards affect them work very differently in other countries. https://www.reddit.com/r/eupersonalfinance/ will be able to help you more.

If your country's banking system is anything like the US one, savings accounts will often provide better interest rates than checking accounts."
freebird1990,"It’s always interesting to me how mentioning Dave Ramsey on this sub will inevitably send people into a tailspin. His advice re: debt management is certainly worth considering in my opinion. But maybe that’s because I’ve been able to pay down over 40k since August following his advice...all student loans and much of it—gasp—under 6% interest. But paying the debt down rather than letting it sit was right for me. Personal finance is personal, and etc. "
freebird1990,"If it sets you at ease at all, a period of unconsciousness (especially hours long but even just a few minutes) almost certainly WOULD necessitate an emergency work up at the hospital. Highly unlikely that you’re going to be out for hours and wake up without a brain injury. You do not just lose consciousness for no reason. 

Source: I work in a neuro/trauma icu. "
freebird1990,"Balance billing is illegal in California (provided you don’t sign anything saying you accept being billed as out of network)—I had a similar issue with a 6k charge from my surgeon in an emergency situation this year. Finally got my insurance to get them to knock it off, but the process took months as the law is somewhat new. You’ll have to check your own state’s laws, though. And if you find that it’s illegal in your state too, file an appeal with your insurance so that they convert the coverage for the PA to in network (the protocol in CA for emergency situations). It will then be illegal for the PA to bill you anything more. "
freebird1990,"Call his nurse and ask if a Social Work consult has been placed. If they’re not sure, ask them to look in his chart and see. If not, ask the nurse to contact his primary team and request a SW consult (many places will do this automatically but it never hurts to double check). Make sure you leave your number and a message to call you (if you want to be contacted). I don’t know the details of his specific situation, but the prognosis for recovery after a bleed (hemorrhagic stroke) is usually much better than after a blockage (ischemic stroke). I would also request a consult to speech pathology so his communication can be evaluated if there is any concern for speech, language, or cognitive deficits. PT and OT too since it sounds like there are motor deficits. Again, many places will place these rehab orders automatically but sometimes they get overlooked so it helps to double check. I’m a speech pathologist in a top 10 US hospital and work with neuro patients in these kinds of situations daily. If you need help navigating anything, please don’t hesitate to reach out. 

Edited: missing a word "
freebird1990,"To be clear, you’re not “paying the extra money now” as you don’t have any money. You’re taking the loan for money you do not have, so that you can hopefully pay it back in the future. Do whatever you want, but the people saying these things are just looking out for you. A car loan never made anyone rich, and buying a car you can’t afford is kind of a stereotypical mistake many people make right out of college. Just lookin out for ya. Good luck either way!"
freebird1990,I lived with my parents for two years after grad school and commuted 55 miles away for work in Southern California traffic (commute coming home was typically 2 hours). I had 110k in student loans and wanted it gone ASAP. It was a big sacrifice but I’m so so glad I did it. Now I’m 28 with no student loans and all the money I make is MINE. 
freebird1990,Agree with this wholeheartedly. There is no reason for you to be in debt over a car when you can have a perfectly good 10k used car and given that you didn’t list your salary I’m guessing it’s either low or nonexistent. Or if you must have a nicer car (and your salary is neither low nor nonexistent) save up 10k and buy one! A car loan in your situation would be financially dumb. Just buy something you can actually afford. 
freebird1990,"Make sure he is connected with a Social Worker in the hospital, who can help connect you/him with resources. Second, his future needs likely largely depend on the severity of his stroke and any residual deficits. You can have a stroke and go back to your normal job, and you can have a worse stroke and be out of work and completely dependent on others for the rest of your life. Make sure he/you are having real discussions with his neurology team regarding prognosis for recovery so you can develop some realistic expectations. I’m really sorry you are going through this. "
freebird1990,"As someone who is about to finish paying off 110k in student loans next week (+20k in interest, kill me), I would say do whatever you possibly can to minimize what you take out. It’s really just such an incredible handicap in starting your life post-college. "
freebird1990,I would be very hesitant to exchange an unsecured loan for a secured loan (ie you could get your house taken away if you mess up). Any way you can consolidate your student loans with someone like sofi at a lower interest rate instead?
freebird1990,"PSLF requires ten years of qualifying payments. Ten years!!! Do you want student loans looming over your head for the next 17 years?! (Rhetorical question, answer is a resounding NO for me but maybe you don’t care). You would be taking a bit of a risk in that you could get denied at the end of it or the program could go away entirely. Even if you do your due diligence, you could get the wrong advice from loan companies and miss a few years due to filing paperwork incorrectly (happened to a coworker even though she really did her best to get everything in order). 

It would also limit your job prospects to employers that qualify. You say you’re sure now that you probably won’t want to work in the private sector, but we’re talking about how you’ll feel 10-15 years in the future. Haven’t you ever changed your mind about something over the course of 10-15 years? 

If I were you, I’d try to pick up a part time job and put as big of a dent as you can in the balance while in grad school. I went through a really intense masters program so I know it can be difficult, but I managed to work ~8 hours a week the first year and I’m glad I did. Even just babysitting whenever you know you’ll be free could be really helpful.

I will finish paying off 130k on Wednesday. I sacrificed a LOT but managed to do it in under three years. I am so glad that I chose to just get rid of it rather than letting it emotionally cripple me over the next 7 years. Whatever you choose to do, good luck!"
freebird1990,"Make sure he gets an evaluation (you can call and ask his RN if speech has been consulted). They will assess him and be able to determine what his deficits are and what kind of therapy he will need if any (ie outpatient vs acute rehab vs home health). I might leave a message for them to call you or your sister so you can discuss their findings. There are many different domains of communication (cognition, speech, voice, receptive language, and expressive language), and he may have difficulty with none, some, or all. The SLP should be able to give you a rough timeline of if/when would be realistic to return to work from a communication standpoint. Ditto for PT/OT with regard to motor stuff. Depends on what he does for work too of course. "
freebird1990,"Definitely agree. I’ll add that as an agnostic democrat, I don’t agree with plenty that he says. I also ignore most of his investment advice. But I think he gives good advice on getting out of debt and it works for many people. I like how he accounts more for the psychological aspect of something like getting out of debt (I used to be a staunch supporter of the debt avalanche, but began finding new and intense ways to throw more $ at my debt when I got the mental reward of the snowball, thus paying things down WAY faster in the long term). "
freebird1990,"I have Trunk Club and I love it. Fyi you also don’t have to pay the $25 fee if you buy something. I have my trunks scheduled for every few months now and I’ve never had to pay the fee because there’s always at least one thing I love. Their stylists are great. I’m assuming you want to create an account because you actually want to purchase things, so you probably wouldn’t have to pay the fee either. Also you can schedule them for as often or not often as you want. Monthly was too frequently for me, and I’ll also cancel it for long stretches if I’m saving for something. It’s really easy to pause/cancel and it’s completely free. "
mormengil,"Pay off all the debt that has a higher interest rate than the mortgage interest rate will be on the new house.

That's probably the cc and the personal loan, but maybe not the truck loan.

Then, put the rest into the new house.

Good luck."
mormengil,"Cut the food bill, and you should be able to save $1,200/mth for debt reduction.

1.  Month 1:  Pay off the debt in collections.

2.  Month 1:  Pay off the credit card.  Now, you should be able to add the $183/mth you were paying to the debt consolidation to your debt reduction fund, and have $1,383/mth to pay off debt.

3.  Month's 2-6:  Pay off the personal loan.  You now have $1,990/mth to pay off debt.

4.  Month's 7-9:  Pay off the car.  You now have $2,255/mth to save or invest.

5.  Hurray!  Debt free in less than 9 months.

6.  Now boost your emergency fund to 3-6 months expenses.

7.  Then boost your retirement contributions to at least 15% of salary.

8.  Then save for goals less than 5 years out, or invest for longer term goals.

Good luck."
mormengil,"You should at least max the employer match, to get free money.

Maybe you should do more, as inheritances 20 years out are not certain bets.

What stops you immediately withdrawing the money and using it is a 10% penalty on early withdrawal, and immediate payment of taxes (if Traditional rather than Roth - which, at least the employer contributions will be).

Good luck."
mormengil,"1.  It's not a bad rental.  It meets the two main rules of thumb for a good rental:  1.  Monthly rent about 1% of purchase price.  2.  Cash flows positive.  You could just keep it.  Over time, the rent will go up.  The Mortgage Payment (P&amp;I) will stay the same.  The amount of equity in the place will go up.  The value might well go up.  Eventually, the mortgage will be paid off, and you will have a nice income stream in retirement.  You leave it to the kids.  They inherit with a stepped up basis and no capital gains taxes to pay if they sell it.  Don't know why you are looking to sell, but you should consider keeping it.

2.  If you sell it, you will have costs.  Say 6% in real estate agents fees, and then long term capital gains taxes of 15%.  So, if you were planning on $135k without taking those into account, it would more likely be $109k cash you would get after sales expenses, paying off the mortgage and taxes, rather than $135k.

3.  If you do sell it, I might split the money between paying a lump off the mortgage on the other property, and investing.  I like paying down enough of the mortgage so that it is paid off before retirement.  But I also like the liquidity (and, possibly higher returns) from investing.  Maybe 50/50?

Good luck."
mormengil,"Housing markets do not often crash.

Some do, and all housing markets are local, and some housing markets in California are possible crash targets.

But, although some local housing markets can and do crash from time to time.  Large scale housing market 'crashes' (as in 2008 - and even that was not a crash everywhere), are rare.

Housing markets are much more likely to flatten, or decline gently, than they are to crash.  Usually, housing markets make slower and less volatile moves than stock markets.  They also signal the moves a bit more.

So, I am not one of those people who says 'don't time the market'  (well, I do say it for the stock market, but not for your local property market),  but, I do think that while you can see a housing market showing signs of rolling over (more houses for sale,  houses taking longer to sell,  houses selling for less than the asking price, etc),  it is hard to estimate the exact timing, duration, or extent of any softening in a local housing market

In any event, your friends should do their own research into what they think the housing market is doing, rather than rely on some hearsay, before they make any decisions.

Then they should think about what they will do, and how badly they will be hurt, if they are wrong, and house prices keep going up?

Good luck."
mormengil,"You are not thinking about this right.

If PMI would cost you $6,500 over 3 years, it would cost you $2,167/yr.  $2,167/$10,000 = 21.6% annual return from using the $10k to pay off the PMI.

Now, you are not going to get anything close to a 22% risk free return from your investments in the 401k.

So, you are better off paying the $10k towards eliminating the PMI as you will get a better return than you would from investing in the 401k.

You cannot compare the cost over 3 years with the return over 30 years."
mormengil,"I did this, and really, I wouldn't do it again.

You might make a measly $300 net, in interest over 4 years.  Is it worth the hassle?

Now, if you were tight on finances, and thought you had enough for college but not really enough for an emergency fund through college, then I might.

Good luck."
mormengil,"If you have an S corp, yes, you can pay yourself less than the profits (as long as the pay you pay yourself is 'normal pay' according to the IRS) and take the rest as dividends, thereby reducing FICA taxes.

Many people would not want to do this unless they were making more than $132,900 in profits.  That is where the Social Security tax caps out, and many people would want to max Social Security contributions to max Social Security benefits.  After that, however, all you save is the Medicare portion of the FICA tax, which never caps out.  The medicare tax is 1.45%, but you pay both halves so, you save 2.9% in taxes.

That concept has nothing to do with whether you have a SEP IRA or a Solo 401k.

I don't know anything about the NYC tax."
mormengil,"Ally is usually one of the last of the on-line banks to raise interest rates on savings accounts.  Most of the others are higher than 2.2% already.

The Fed is trying to get interest rates back to normal, so they have been going up.  However, now that inflation seems to be decreasing, and the stock market has been wobbly, they might not keep going up so fast.

Interest rates going up is good if you are a saver, bad if you are going to borrow money.

Good luck."
mormengil,"If you view this as a temporary supplement to your emergency fund.

Good luck."
mormengil,"$12k in cash should be enough for an emergency fund, especially as your expenses will fall (no mortgage payment), and you will build up liquid assets quickly as you will be saving $2,000/mth.

mormengil,"If he is upside down, The most likely explanation for why he is upside down is that he took out additional loans against the house.

However, if the house has kept going up in price every year, it is unlikely that he is upside down on it.  As, even if he took out a second mortgage, no lender would have been likely to give him a mortgage  for more than the house (minus any other mortgages) was worth at the time.  So, if the  value of the house has kept going up, it is unlikely that he would be underwater, even if he took out a second mortgage or a HELOC.

So, he might have been able to get underwater through some dubious and irregular borrowing, or, he might not be underwater at all, but just be mis-understanding the term, or not wanting to listen to your advice to sell the house (for whatever reason) and just dismissing it by saying he can't sell it as he is underwater."
mormengil,"You can keep contributing to the Roth IRA via the backdoor method (and you should).

If your 401k allows it (most do not), you could also contribute to the Roth IRA via the 'megabackdoor' method.

If you can do the megabackdoor, that would be the fastest way to get that $50k back into your Roth IRA.  You could probably shovel it all back in over the next 2 years.

Other than putting the money back into the Roth IRA via the two routes above, the best way to get that money into tax advantaged retirement accounts would be to increase your 401k contributions from maxing the employer match, to maxing the contribution at $19k/yr.  Use the $50k for living expenses, while increasing contributions from payroll to the 401k.

You can use all three of the above methods (if possible) at the same time, to get your money back into tax advantaged accounts as quickly as possible.

Good luck."
mormengil,"I'm guessing your take home pay should be around $2,400/mth?

Your expenses might be $400/mth.

Perhaps you could save $2,000/mth at the moment.  If you could save that for 5 months, before moving out in June, you could have $15,000 in savings, instead of $5,000.

You could move out with $5,000 saved, but it would be tight.  If you could have $15k saved when you move out it would be a lot more comfortable.

mormengil,"Put it in a high yield savings account at an on line bank like Marcus or Ally, and it will make a nice emergency fund.

By the way, I am not a great fan of your plan.  I suggest, haunt your college's careers office and get a job in the 'traditional career for your major', at least while undergoing the 'NYC job application process'.  Better to make more than $20-30k/yr while that (seems to be lengthy) process takes place.

Then, if you get the low paying (but utterly fascinating) job you desire, you might have found out that you actually like the higher paying job you already have, and like the money.  Or, not.

At any rate, you will have made more money while waiting around for the application process to happen.

Good luck."
mormengil,"The TSP is one of the best retirement accounts in America.  You are not going to find lower expense ratios on index funds in any account you can find on the open market.

Although there are a few advantages to a Roth IRA, over a Roth TSP, I think the TSP has enough advantages that you should stick with it.  

One suggestion:  Switch your Roth TSP contributions to Traditional TSP contributions.  Then, take the money you save in taxes and contribute that to a Roth IRA.

Good luck."
mormengil,"Vanguard has a patented method of re-balancing their index mututal funds by doing the re-balancing in their mirroring ETFs, and then importing the re-balance into the Mutual Funds.  (The patent runs out fairly soon, 2025, I think).

The reason why ETFs are more tax efficient than Mutual Funds is that all index funds need to re-balance their portfolios periodically to stay aligned to their indices.  This means they have to sell some positions and buy others.  If the positions they sell have gains, then they will have to pay capital gains taxes, which they will pass on to you if held in a taxable account.  

ETFs can re-balance in a much more tax efficient way (which causes considerably fewer taxable events) than Mutual Funds can.  So, ETFs are more tax efficient in taxable accounts.  

Except for Vanguard, who figured out how to do the re-balancing in their mirroring ETFs and import that into the Mutual Funds in a tax efficient way, and then were clever enough to patent it.

mormengil,"1.  You could if you had opened the Solo 401k account before the end of 2018.  Then, you would have up until tax day in April  2019 to make 2018 contributions.  But the account would have had to be opened in 2018.  Now regular IRAs, you can open the account and invest up until April 15 2019 for 2018 contributions.  I don't know about SEP IRAs.

2.  I think you should be able to roll a SEP IRA into a Solo 401k, but only a limited number of Solos would allow this.  I think E-Trades would, but I don't think Schwab's or Fidelity's Solos have this feature.

3.   Maybe.  Some Solo 401ks might pay interest on un-invested money.  You would have to check.  However, better to invest in something.

4.  The best investment for a beginner is probably to put your money in your broker's Target Date Index Fund, with a target date close to your retirement age.  These will have a huge diversification of investments, usually total US stock market, total International stock market, and a bond fund.  They will automatically re-balance for you, and they will get more conservative (more bond funds in the portfolio) as you get closer to the target date.  They used to be expensive.  So people used to run their own portfolios, but the expense ratios on Target Date Index Funds from good brokers like Schwab, Fidelity or Vanguard have come down so far that there is very little incentive left to run your own portfolio.

Good luck."
mormengil,"Yes, you need to report it.  I have  always just estimated.  You are not taxed on any of it.  I don't know why they want to know.  Probably just to keep  track of you ex-US money so that if  it changes a lot, they can see if you owe any US taxes."
mormengil,"1.  You can contribute $19,000 to a 401k this year (2019).

2.  The tax advantages of a 401k are worth roughly an extra 1.5% average return.  The fees and expenses in your 401k would have to be higher than 1.5% to even start thinking about investing in a taxable account with Vanguard instead of contributing to the 401k.

3.  You could (and probably should) contribute directly to Vanguard  and invest in a tax advantaged account, if you open a Roth IRA with Vanguard.  However, the max you can contribute to IRAs is $6,000/yr.  Contributing to an ordinary (taxable) brokerage account with Vanguard will not be as good as contributing to your 401k, unless the fees and expenses in the 401k are more than 1.5%/yr.

Good luck."
mormengil,"All real estate markets are local.  In some places, you would have done much better to have bought 10 years ago instead of rented.  In other places you would have done better to have rented and invested.

You would need to look at property price appreciation in your location over the last 10 years, and at investment appreciation over the last 10 years, and then model the results of the two scenarios.

Good luck."
mormengil,"Stay with parents until July 2019.  Save $2,500/mth.  You will save $15,000 by then.

$5,000 towards paying down debt.  $10k towards an emergency fund.

Then, it depends on the cash flow from renting the house.  If it cash flows positive, after paying mortgage, property tax, insurance, maintenance and voids, I would keep renting it out.  Try to rent someplace for less, keep paying off the debt, and contribute to retirement after the debt is paid off.

If it did not cash flow positive, sell it, and use the money to pay off debt.  Rent, contribute 20% of income plus to retirement, and try to save more for an eventual down payment on another house.

Good luck."

Citryphus,"I plan on never spending my HSA until I'm retired. So I keep cash and short-term securities for normal medical expenses outside my HSA. However, I'm a bit more conservative with the HSA investments. I wouldn't want to have to sell stocks during an poorly-timed hospitalization."
Citryphus,I don't want to discourage you but it's going to be next to impossible for you to get a business loan. You might have to work for a few years to get the money together to go out on your own.
Citryphus,"LLC formation might cost you a little or more than a little, depending on your state. After that it's usually inexpensive to maintain. When you say ""register"" the sole prop. Do you mean a DBA certificate? Did you register for sales tax? What exactly did you do to register?

Doing business as an LLC will help protect your personal assets if your business gets sued, but it won't pay the attorney, so if getting sued is a possibility you want to get business liability insurance."
Citryphus,"You don't need to wait for a 1099 to file. You should already know what the 1099 will say. Look at Schedule C. Find any business expenses you can take to offset your income and calculate your net profit. Multiply that by .9235, then by 0.153. That's your SE tax. You could send that in, or what 1040-ES says, by January 15, but even if you don't the penalty for underpayment will be pretty low."
Citryphus,"You can't control who buys your mortgage after you close. If you end up with Wells Fargo at some point you'll just have to accept it or refinance. When comparing mortgage offers it helps to look at the APR, because that includes any extra costs like points that lower the mortgage rate. A lower mortgage rate means a smaller payment, but a lower APR mean a smaller present cost overall, which is what you should be shooting for. "
Citryphus,"Not sure there's a right or wrong here. The future is uncertain. If you were to just put $21k towards your mortgage you'd go from 290 payments remaining to 271. It turns out you would get to 75% LTV exactly at 60 months, when the 75% requirement is no longer needed. So $21k strangely puts you no closer to removing PMI. Maybe you should look at wiping out the car loan, or refinancing to a 15-year if you can afford that payment."
Citryphus,"It sounds like the $25k is his net profit after expenses. Unless his LLC has elected to be taxed as a corporation, the business revenue, expenses, and net profit are determined on 1040 Schedule C and he needs tax software that supports that. He owes self-employment tax on that, and income tax, whether he ""pays it to himself"" or not. Even if he leaves it in the business it's taxable income to him. "
Citryphus,"If you contribute $7k then you save $1,300 but push your loan repayment out a month. You're obviously not paying anywhere close to $1,300 in interest per month on $65k of debt, so funding the HSAs seems like a no-brainer to me."
Citryphus,"NY's 529 uses Vanguard funds and you can get very similar results to anything you could do outside the 529. There's no inherent reason for a ""lag."" It's still worth it even without the state deduction, so you should save more than $5k if you anticipate you'll need to for higher education costs. However, you shouldn't do it at the expense of your own retirement. That savings is more important."
Citryphus,"You can either choose to reduce your tax now, by making a Traditional contribution, or not reduce your tax now, but making a Roth contribution. When compared with making no contribution at all, there is no ""additional"" tax for making a Roth contribution. You can contribute $6,500 for 2018 only if you were age 50 or older in 2018."
Citryphus,"Whoever you rent space from will require you to carry liability insurance. But that won't cover getting sued over pictures. The problem with weddings and other one-time events, as I understand it, is that something goes wrong with the pictures; they're lost, or they don't come out right. Do enough of them and it'll probably happen once. People who come in to your space to be photographed can always come back in if something goes wrong the first time. I'd say the odds of being sued go way down."
Citryphus,"The closest you can come to a useful comparison is your marginal labor rate, which has only a little to do with your gross pay. Why do you work an average of 50 hrs/week and not 52, or 60? Probably because you value the time more than the after-tax income from those extra hours of work. If your marginal tax rate is around 30% then you are rejecting extra work at $27/hr.

Paying someone $15 to deliver your groceries instead of spending an hour doing it yourself is consistent with valuing an extra hour of leisure at $27/hr."
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"&gt; I'd rather suffer with debt then take away food from people that really need it.

Im not trying to rub it in but you are living off of *child support money from the dad of the kids mom who she is still married to.* Thats well above moral high ground and well into needing food money territory.  "
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"Baby born with complications, missed 30 day qualifying event window for health insurance. Are we bankrupt? My wife gave birth to our second child in early December. He was born with a nuchal cord (umbilical cord wrapped around his neck) and he spent a week in NICU due to complications. Happy to say he's home and perfectly healthy now.

During all of that commotion, no one mentioned to us how important it was to fill out the qualifying event form for him to be added to the health insurance policy through work. My wife and I work for the same employer under the same policy. We were in contact with the insurance company many times (trying to figure out how much this was going to cost us), but the form was never mentioned.

Fast forward a week later to the babies first well visit, and the topic of insurance came  up. The front office person put my wife on the phone with our insurance company - the person on the phone said that they would ""add him""[meaning my son] and that it was all taken care of. 

Second well visit, insurance was never mentioned. 

Today, The hospital just informed us that the claim was denied and that we need to pay the full amount, due to not filing the form in time. 

We reached out to the insurance broker who said she would ""try"", but she mentioned providers are very strict about this. The provider is United Health Care

I admit that it was my fault for not filing the form in time, but is there anything that can be done here? I dont know the exact bill but I was told the pre-negotiated amount is six figures. 

My financial situation is ""ok"" at best. We've aggressively paid off all student loans, credit cards, and car notes since we found out she was pregnant, and we are in the process of building an emergency fund. We are out of debt but cash poor. We have some equity in our house and good credit scores. Wife and I work full time and she is a part time student finishing her degree. 

I actually sent out a check for close to $10k (our last debt) today. I'm trying to stop payment on it. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation?"
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"Ouch! When did this take place? I've been reading that the baby is always covered under mom for 30 days post obamacare. Is that true? Ours is an employer plan and not through the exchange, if that makes a difference. "
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"You're dismissing your role in this. You didnt need to finance a divorce on CC bills. You didnt need to buy a car you couldnt afford. You didnt need to carry student load debt. You didnt need to do a lot of things. Lots of people do those things and it doesnt make you a bad person, but saying that it all just happened to you passively is a recipe for this to happen again. 

A very significant number of people whole file for bankruptcy go on to do so again because they didnt change the behavior that got them there in the first place. "
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"We spoke to them 48ish hours after the birth inquiring about expected costs while in NICU, and then again a few days later, and then a week or so after birth at the doctors office. Of course, none of this is documented.

Its not a ticky tack claim, we're talking something like $50-80k after negotiation, so I cant say I'm surprised. "
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"If you are ok with rebalancing your portfolio from time to time, you can replicate the target date fund allocation using zero cost fidelity funds. Its a bit more hands on, but you can save even more on fees if that is your goal.

Nearly 6% load is borderline criminal!"
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"&gt; She cannot claim an education credit in this case because her net qualified educational expenses are $0.

Thank you for your response! This statement makes sense to me logically, but I havent seen it written in the tax code (just references to if your net tax liability is zero, then you can claim 40% of the credit). Can you elaborate?

"
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"You have an FHA mortgage and the rules change considerably every year. You need to contact the bank that owns your mortgage and ask them about the process of removing PMI. For some FHA loans, you cant remove it at all and the only way to remove it is pay it off or refinance. In my case, I have to hit 22% equity based on the ORIGINAL AMORTIZATION SCHEDULE to remove it. The actual market value does not matter at all.

With the rate increases since 14, it likely will cost you more to refi than the PMI costs. 

For sure contact the bank before you shell out $$ for an appraisal. 

Edit: Taxable value is always going to be lower than market value"
Eyimanewpizzaguy,"Questions about 1098-T form. How should I treat taxable scholarship income? My wife and I both work full time and have W2 forms from our employers. 

I plan to file my Federal taxes using Credit Karma (no state tax where I live).

I am confused about the Education Credit. My wife attended school full time for most of 2018. She earned scholarships of around $12k (box 5 1098-T) in the form of Pell grants and a few private scholarships. She had qualified expenses of about 9500 (box 1 1098-T plus a few hundred for required textbooks).

She did not receive a W2  from her university, only the 1098-T.

Should I create a separate W2 (in credit karma) and list the $2500 difference as ""wages, tips, and other income"" with the employer being her school?

Do we still qualify for the $2500 American Opportunity Education Credit even though her scholarships exceeded her qualified expenses?

Should we claim the entire scholarship amount as income? 

I expected a refund of around $2500 but the education credit represents half of the return, increasing it to $4900 per credit karma. Our only other deductions are 2 small children and a few hundred in student loan interest (plus standard deduction).


All this is making me think I should go to H&amp;R Block or something, I dont want to screw up.

Thank you!

Eyimanewpizzaguy,"OP is wildly dismissive of his/her spending problem and blames 100% of it on a divorce (including their ongoing behavior). I hear this all of the time. People feel like going into mountains of CC debt is NBG as long as the money wasnt spent on vacations and TV's. Guess what, it doesnt matter when the money was spent on as its now a boat anchor sinking you financially. I wish the best for the OP but IMO he/she will just kick the can down the road (refi) and the situation will continue to snowball. "
wanttostayhidden,Not necessarily. Short-term disability benefits are taxable if your employer paid the premiums. Your claims payments will be subject to taxation in proportion the employer paid. The insurance company may withhold an appropriate amount from your claims check and report the income to the IRS.
wanttostayhidden,"All of my bills are autopay. Once in a while something will increase and I notice it right away as I look at my account online line at least every other week. You need to look at your account at least monthly. If you have any fraud, you only have 60 days max to report it or you have no chance of getting your money back."
wanttostayhidden,"Are you sure it was a 10K raise plus a 2K bonus? Could it have been an 8K raise and a 2K bonus for a total of 10K? With the way the math works out, this looks like it could be a possibility. Or as others have stated, perhaps the raise wasn't in effect for the entire pay period."
wanttostayhidden,Interesting. It was 2014 when we did this. Paid to 78% within a few months of taking out the mortgage and PMI was dropped. We didn't have to meet any kind of time requirements. Perhaps rules have changed in the past few years though.
wanttostayhidden,I have never seen any lender adjust a car loan when paid ahead. The only way I have seen that done is if you refinance the loan which would not be a good idea since OP has a 0% loan right now.
wanttostayhidden,"If you were a minor when the cards were open, you were probably just added as an authorized user. I did this for my minor son to give him a little credit boost. He isn't responsible for any of the charges as I am the primary account holder. I would remove myself from any card with a balance and leave myself on the others to keep the credit history."
wanttostayhidden,"Typically the authorized user gets the entire history of the card so it doesn't matter if you add them now or later. That's why it's better to add them to an old card instead of a recently opened one. You want to make sure the card issuer reports authorized users to the credit bureaus as not all of them do.

I added my son to a 13 year old card when he turned 16 and got his license. I let him carry the card for emergencies or if I need him to pick something up for me when he is out."
wanttostayhidden,"Freetaxusa was free for federal last year and we had the 8889 form. Probably is again this year. It's also only about $13 if you need state as well.

We made well over the 66K limit and paid under $12 to do our taxes last year with freetaxusa."
wanttostayhidden,"Our 30 year mortgage was $214,000 @ 4.5% and our payment is just over $1300. This includes only the payment, interest, insurance and property taxes--we don't pay PMI or have HOA fees. I think you are severely underestimating the payment on $350,000."
wanttostayhidden,"You are 18. You do not need your parents permission to open an account, nor do they need to be on your account. You can also get a job and your license without them.

They sound very controlling and if it were me, I would not want them to have any access to my account."
wanttostayhidden,"Due to that, it's exactly why we do plan our life around the worst case scenarios. We will never again put ourselves in a position where if one of us loses our job, we can't survive. Our new house is well under the amount we could really afford. If something happens to one of our jobs, we will be able to pay all of our bills, even if the the only job we can pick up is a minimum wage one.  We also have a large emergency fund.

$200 a month extra is very tight. It wouldn't take a very large expense to hit you and cause you to really struggle. It could be something as simple as your property taxes jumped and there a shortage in your escrow account so your mortgage payment increases. One year ours increased by almost $150/month."
wanttostayhidden,It drops to $500 if they turn 17 before the end of the year and he turned 17 in Nov. It was the first year we weren't going to phase out and get the full amount. I had no idea it was if they were under 17--I thought it was under 18.
Brye11626,"There's a separate Fico ""auto score"" that goes up to 900 instead of the 850 of the normal score. That's what they got in this situation. Just another reason to pay attention to your credit score factors, but not the exact number itself."
Brye11626,"It's unlikely you'll find much support around here for this. You'll be paying about 45% of your gross income towards housing, and about 55% of your net assuming you don't save anything for retirement. This far exceeds the general ceiling suggestions of 30% gross, 40% net.

You don't really mention your other expenses other than the $100 comment. Do you have a car? Do you pay for public transport? Interested in traveling? Need new furniture when you move? Thinking about retirement savings? These are all important things to factor in. You should be saving at least the difference in apartments ($500) easily each month before you'd make this move. Only a realistic budget that you make can give you this answer. I'd suggest actually tracking your spending for a few months, rather than just trying to list things off."
Brye11626,"It's not really the case, but can be dependent on number of bedrooms, desirability of the building, and time of year. My friend moved into a $3900 3-br this past weekend that they offered $3600 on, and was instantly accepted. Free $1200/yr/person just for making a comment.

May - September are really bad months for negotiating though, so you'll want to time your lease renewals outside that area if possible for the best deals."
Brye11626,"The more you own and/or are responsible for, the more you need an emergency fund and the larger it needs to be. Some situations in life are unpredictable, but depending on how your life is set up you can mitigate problems a lot of the time without cash laying around. The general suggestion of 3-6 months isn't really a suggested range, it's a lifestyle range. The more you own will put you towards 6 (or more) months, where a lite lifestyle without responsibility could survive on 3 or less.

Rent an apt instead of owning a home? A smaller fund will do.

Good low-deductable health insurance?  A smaller fund will do.

Take public transport instead of driving? A smaller fund will do.

Single, no dependents, and a secure job? A smaller fund will do."
Brye11626,"90k in Arlington is $65k after taxes.

58k in rural WA is $47k after taxes.

Both of those assume no deductions. Worthwhile to ask about work retirement plans, benefits, healthcare etc. The top end of the bracket ($90k) would get you an increase of 18k/year or $1,500/mo. A good chunk (at least half) of that would likely be eaten up by housing. Other expenses would likely add up at well to mean it's a break even or very close trade-off.

The difference would be long-term growth. If you think there's a better chance at salary expansion moving forward in DC than WA, it may be worthwhile, even if it doesn't help in the short-term."
Brye11626,"You are doing just fine. You'll likely fall a bit short of the ""1x income by age 30"" suggestion, but it seems like maybe you got a bit of a later start on the 401k compared to your IRA. Did you just start you 401k 2-3 years ago compared to 4-5 for your IRA? 

Based on 60k income between the last two years you are saving essentially 20% of your income for retirement. Thats a great job."
Brye11626,"You are correct that a Trad IRA does you no good, so you ""have to"" stick with Roth. As for what ratio of pre-tax and post-tax funds you want to contribute is a lot of guesswork. At your income I'd personally suggest at least a 2:1 ratio of Traditional to Roth which would mean that should be saving at least 13% of your income in your 401k (with your employer match). If you aren't, I'd personally suggest lowering your IRA and contributing more to your 401k until you reach that ratio.

People have different opinions on this, however. You'll get a lot of different answers since things like tax brackets, life situations, and future costs can all influence which one is best. And they are all subject to change moving forward."
Brye11626,"It seems highly unlikely ""all of your house"" is used for business. The IRS says that you have to use the space ""primarily and exclusively for business"". Basically that you don't regularly use the space for anything other than working. Is the primary use of your personal bedroom for business? Your kitchen? Your bathrooms? Seems highly unlikely.

I'm not sure what your linked articles is aout. They don't mention anything about deducting the whole tax burden. That article is about SALT changes with the new tax law and how home office deductions can be done separately."
Brye11626,"Bond funds return fluctuates, but will usually beat those of a savings account over a reasonable enough length of time. The annual return of Vanguard's Total Bond Market fund since it's inception in 1986 is 5.79%/yr. It's 5-year return is 2.56% which is higher than your 2.0%  savings accounts rates today, and much higher than savings accounts were 5 years ago."
Brye11626,"Everyone has their own opinion on spending of course. The basis of a lot of this goes back to the 1969 government housing regulation that said 25% (gross) of a households income would be the most a landlord could charge for rent in public housing. This number was then bumped up to 30% a few decades later. This was the first ""max rent"" ceiling.

In reality it's situation dependent which leads to more confusion.  If you don't have a car, for example, you can spend more on housing since you have dropped another expense. The more money you make, the more you can stretch these numbers as well, since other costs don't tend to rise at the same rate. Someone making 90k doesn't need to spend 3x on food, gasoline, utilities, etc than someone making 30k.

Tl;DR: 25-30% gross is probably the most realistic numbers for middle income individuals, but again this is meant as a ""max value"". Poorer individuals will likely have to go higher, richer individuals can usually go lower. Many cities implement ""40x rules"" saying you must make annually 40x the monthly rent. After you do some simple math you see this is a fancy way of saying rent can't exceed 30% of your monthly income."
Brye11626,"Your money is technically earning ~2.5% in their money market mutual fund until you invest it. You can buy an etf soon (vti is $148/share currently). You are right that mutual funds have higher minimums. Most are $3k, some are $1k such as the target-date funds at Vanguard.

The difference in returns on a value that low is fairly inconsequential. Once you put in more money make sure it's invested for the longterm."
Brye11626,"Erm, you have the funds flipped a bit. The S fund is the S&amp;P500 which likely should make up the majority of your holdings. The S&amp;P makes up \~75% of the USA stock market.

My personal preference for retirement funds are:

C Fund - 55%

S Fund - 20%

I Fund - 25%

Brye11626,"You are missing the point, I believe. Once April 15th comes you can't contribute to 2018 anymore. You lose that space forever. If OP is going to be able to rebuild their emergency fund and contribute to an IRA in 2019, then it's absolutely worth it to do what they are implying. Even if the money isn't invested for the first 6 months, the growth from 2019 -&gt; retirement tax-free is worth the annoyance of having to withdraw the funds from the account in the case of an emergency in the next couple months. "
Brye11626,It's not worth it at your account levels. You'll probably want to wait until you have $1k or more to start to investing. Many HSAs also have minimum cash reserves required for this very reason (mine requires me to have $1k cash before investing). Might want to check on that as well.
Brye11626,"Do you have any sort statistics to back up that claim? A good chunk of low-income social security in non-taxable and with the median savings for retirement only sitting around 125k, your claims (about both tax rates and spending) seem highly unlikely."
Brye11626,"You pay the net, so Fidelity is 0.01% cheaper. I wouldn't suggest moving for such a miniscule amount, however. There will very likely be a larger difference between the returns than that over their lifetime anyway.

Go with whichever one is more convenient, or that you like the fund makeup and glide path better."
Brye11626,"Was there any type of employee match or base-line contribution by your employer to your account at your last job? Even if all of your contributed funds are post-tax, employer contributions must be traditional pre-tax. Rolling over those funds would lead to a taxable event."
Brye11626,"I guess it's possible, but seems oddly difficult. 

Do you live with roommates or at home with family? Do you pay for car insurance, gas, and car repairs by yourself or does someone help? Just food, gas, and car insurance/repairs put me well over $400/mo when I was starting out. I'm not sure how all other expenses, including furnishing an apartment, will fit in that budget but I'm not one to tell you what's possible in your own life."
NeutronStarPasta,Lock your reports. It's not totally unheard of for parents to use their kids for credit related things. Especially if they are having payment issues or have less than stellar credit scores. Better be safe than sorry before reaching out to the company to ask why there's an inquiry.
NeutronStarPasta,"It depends. When does your lease start? Did you get keys today? If you're technically able to move in today but are choosing to move in on the 21st, then it should start today. Does your lease have a section on it that explains?"
NeutronStarPasta,"I've had good luck with independent insurance agents. They took my info and compared policies with most major companies as well as some local ones. They don't really have loyalty to one company over another and we reevaluate each year to make sure it's the best policy for me. Saved me almost $100/month from what State Farm wanted to charge (multiple auto, home, personal articles etc)."
NeutronStarPasta,"Generally no. Some employers might but there's always one. My wife recently got a new job and during the acceptance phase she mentioned it. It's where you negotiate everything anyway. They allowed her to take a week and a half for an Alaskan cruise just a few months later. It was partially unpaid because she hadn't accrued enough PTO, but they did give her a couple days paid that made her go negative. Anyway, they understood and worked out a deal."
NeutronStarPasta,I had something similar happen with my debit card. Several purchases at two gas stations I frequent that I didn't make (I was out of town on business at the time). Then there were some purchases from boutique shops in France I also didn't make haha. Turns out someone put a card skimming software on the computers at a Subway restaurant I went to often and that's how the info got stolen. Got a new card and charges refunded. 
NeutronStarPasta,"It is your responsibility to ensure bills are getting to insurance and paid - to the best of your ability. Obviously there's things you just can't know, but in this situation I'd call both the billing dept at the hospital and your insurance company to see if any claims have been filed. With that info you should be able to better figure out where you stand. 

Generally, hospitals have 1 year to bill for services before they write them off. But every insurance company and hospital is different."
NeutronStarPasta,My wife works at an insurance call center - how providers code things is often of great debate. Since the insurance company isn't present during the procedures they have to trust what the providers code it as. Sometimes they are way wrong (a format they don't even use) and sometimes it's even blank. Like OP said - be diligent and always ask questions/dispute when you feel slighted. Nice work OP!
NeutronStarPasta,"Be prepared for it to cost though. Some complexes don't have fees but some do. Some won't let you break your lease without someone to fill it. Just be mentally prepared. I know you don't want to borrow money but desperate times...

NeutronStarPasta,"Anecdotally, I've seen temp jobs with higher rates than permanent jobs for that reason. They need an immediate fill and will pay a higher amount because it's temporary and it slows the flakiness of people. Don't just assume you'll get what you're getting now"
NeutronStarPasta,"There should be additional information on your policy. For instance, where I work, our company is self insured so I get health insurance through my company and we can go virtually anywhere within 50 miles of downtown. But we have a lot of remote employees with the same insurance. When outside the 50 miles range, we use Cigna. So those associates just look at Cigna in-network providers. Yours might be the same. Also, as others stated, most policies have emergency ER visit being covered regardless of in/out network"
NeutronStarPasta,"Ask for an itemized receipt first. You may find mistakes that can be disputed and reduce the overall bill.

Get a printout of benefits from your insurance company. $30k seems high for a hdhp. Dispute some things with the insurance company if it seems like it should be paid at a higher rate. 

Then call the billing dept and ask what can be done. Let them know what you realistically can pay and ask for a payment plan. Most (not all) have an option to pay over several years with no interest.  "

If she's just an authorized user, she isn't held liable for paying off the credit line. In either case, her credit will be affected (more if she's a joint account holder and it goes to collections)."
NeutronStarPasta,"Ah sorry I glossed over that part. If she's been removed from the account (no longer has access to the card at all) then she's no longer liable for the balance. 

How long ago was this? I would strongly suggest pulling her credit report and seeing if it's still on there if it's been at least a few months. "
NeutronStarPasta,"Take out a loan for $20k?

NeutronStarPasta,"You're married so you're in this together. You're both now responsible for the lease. I've not had luck with extending terms, but you're gonna have to do what you can to pay rent or face eviction and bad credit. Part of the vows - good times and bad.

NeutronStarPasta,"You can lock them for free by going to each of the 3 bureau's. You just have to prove who you are, they will give you a PIN so that when you want to unfreeze it, you can. It's a protection thing - it reduces the chances someone can open an account using your identity. You will have to unfreeze it when doing something credit related (renting apartment, buying house, buying car, changing jobs, etc...) but it's free to freeze. "
NeutronStarPasta,"Is there an early termination clause? Depending on circumstances, you might be able to cancel lease and get a new apartment that's cheaper (not from LA so I'm sure cheaper is not easy). Is he done working forever? Or is this temporary? Ultimately the apartment is too expensive. Should definitely plan on relocating to something more affordable so if you have one income you can get by. "

that New Jersey is one of the states that taxes contributions to HSAs. How does this affect how I should view the HSA? Is it not as good as it's normally touted to be? And does the tax depend on the state that I live or the state that I work in?"
irregular_regular,Right so I have $6000 in my checking account. I'd like to deposit it into the traditional ira before converting everything in the tradition ira to roth (some reading gave me the impression this is simpler from a tax perspective) and I'd just like to double check this is the case or if there is a better option. 
irregular_regular,So I'm not eligible for the direct roth ira contribution anymore. My worry is would the tax forms know that there was no tax deduction taken on the 6k deposited. i.e. there is 10k from a trad-401k rolled over to the trad-ira. I add 6k making the balance 16k but I don't take the tax deductions on the 6k and make the roth conversion. Would vanguard handle the tax information properly such that I can simply download a pdf and hand that over to an accountant?
irregular_regular,"If I can make a reduced Roth IRA contribution (my income is between 122,000-137,000) should I do that or just do a backdoor Roth IRA? It seems like the backdoor Roth IRA is just better since I can make the full contribution. Is that right?"

nothlit,"If you have any pre-tax balances in any IRAs, then your Roth conversion is prorated between your pre-tax and after-tax balances. The IRS doesn't let you convert only the after-tax amounts.

nothlit,"Self-employment taxes are separate from your federal income tax. When you have a job as a regular employee, in addition to income tax, you also pay half of what's often referred to as payroll taxes or FICA taxes (6.2% for Social Security and 1.45% for Medicare). Your employer pays the other half. Since these are flat rates, they come out of your paycheck and don't really show up anywhere on your federal income tax return unless there was an error in the withholding. When you are self-employed, you have to pay both the employer and employee halves of those taxes, for a total of 15.3%, on 92.35% of your net profits, and that's referred to as self-employment taxes. This gets calculated on Schedule SE which is filed along with your income tax return. It's an entirely separate parallel set of taxes you pay, so it's not affected by things like the standard deduction of the income tax.

Since the US tax system is ""pay as you earn"", and taxes aren't withheld from earnings you receive as an independent contractor, you're supposed to make quarterly estimated tax payments. Filing at the end of the year is just settling up any minor differences."
nothlit,"Yeah, ultimately the IRA provider does not (cannot, really) keep track of taxes or penalties because they don't know the purpose of your withdrawal (you can withdraw earnings penalty-free for certain reasons), and they don't know about any other IRAs you might have elsewhere.

The amount doesn’t actually end up anywhere on your tax return unless you qualify for the Saver’s Credit, which phases out at pretty low income levels."

nothlit,"Recharacterization applies to contributions. When you recharacterize a contribution, it's basically saying ""oops, I meant for that to be this other type of contribution."" You can only recharacterize contributions for a given tax year until the filing deadline for that tax year (including extensions). You can recharacterize in either direction (i.e., a Roth contribution becomes traditional, or a traditional contribution becomes Roth). When you recharacterize, any earnings attributable to that contribution go along for the ride.

Conversion is when you transfer money from a traditional retirement account to a Roth account, and this is not limited to any specific tax year. In other words, you could convert the entire balance of your traditional IRA if you wanted to, even if it contains money you contributed several years ago. When you convert from a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, you pay taxes on whatever portion of the conversion consists of pre-tax contributions and earnings.

You used to be able to recharacterize a conversion (i.e., undo the conversion), but this was eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Recharacterization of contributions is still allowed."
nothlit,"&gt; But if I make a tIRA contribution in July 2019, I'm ""not covered by an employer plan"" since I'm jobless. Does that mean the contribution is still deductible? Or will the IRS say ""No you WERE covered by a 401k WHILE you made that earned income""?

If you were covered by an employer retirement plan at any time during the year, and your MAGI for the year exceeds the applicable limit, then you are ineligible for the deduction."
nothlit,"As you may already know, a 403b is offered by your employer, whereas an IRA is an individual retirement account unrelated to your employer. For 2019, you can contribute up to $19k to a 403b, and, separately, up to $6k to an IRA.

ktfzh64338,"&gt; 1) I can select a different set of investments between ""after-tax"" and ""roth in-plan conversion"". So if I invest 100% on stock ABC for after-tax and stock XYZ for roth conversion, does this mean that when fidelity does the automatic conversion after every quarter, it will sell ABC tax any capital gains/earnings then with that buy XYZ which would now be able to grow tax free?

I'm also doing Fidelity Mega Backdoor, and I had this exact same question. In practice I've found that when I have them do the AT-&gt;Roth conversion, the investments don't change. 

I called up and asked the fidelity agent if this is expected, and he said that was the way my plan had elected to set this up, to ignore the ""in plan conversion"" allocation settings. So maybe the answer depends on what your company has decided to set up. "

ktfzh64338,"$980x50 = 49k, not 490k. You walk away with ~90.02% of your salary. Which is about what you'd expect with a 10% tax rate everywhere, and a small standard deduction.

&gt; Let's say that my wife and I make 50k each, for a total of 100k and we worked in two different taxable states... Are you saying that at 10%, we would owe $10k to both states?

No, $5k to each state. Basically think of think of it as:

tax owed to state = (tax owed to state, as if all income was in that state) * (percentage of that state's income relative to your total income). 
 
The calculations are not quite that simple, but that's sort of the spirit of how they work. 

If I live in Washington, and hold two jobs (one in oregon earning $50k, one in washington earning $50k), than I owe more Oregon income tax than an oregon resident that only earned $50k. Because overall I'm wealthier, and the voters who setup the progressive income tax feels like they can tax higher earners at higher rates than lower earners. 

Also assuming your wife earns $50K, you can see that oregon is not ""taxing all of her income"", since your overall liability only went up by $1000 when you added her income to your tax return. If oregon was really taxing all of her income your liability would have gone up by $5,000 when you added her."

ktfzh64338,"&gt; “sell right away to avoid additional taxes”

This advice doesn't make much sense, not sure if you misread it or got some bad advice somewhere, but usually the recommendation is to sell right away to diversify your holdings away from your employer to mitigate risk of loss. 

Selling right away doesn't really avoid any additional taxes. The only way you'd have additional taxes is if the stock price increased further, in which case that would be a reason *not* to sell."
ktfzh64338,"&gt; For example. Let's say that I earned $100, my wife earned $100,and taxes are 25%.

See, the problem with your example, is that taxes aren't flat. They're progressive. And they're progressive based on your *entire* income, not just the income you earned in that state.

Oregon *does* only tax income that you earned in this state, but they may tax it *at a higher rate*, because overall your total income is higher. 

Think about it this way, pretend the tax laws are the same in each state: your first $10,000 of income is untaxed, and beyond that it's 10%. 

Using your logic, if you earned $10,000 in each of 50 states ($500,000), then you would owe no income tax to anyone, because you assume each state looks at you in isolation, and you think your first $10,000 in each state is tax free. But it doesn't work that way. Each state is going to look at you as a high $500,000 earner, and say: ""well your first $10,000 is free, but we want our cut of the other $490,000 income you earned, which would be $49000 / 50 = $980"".

So with this example you can see how by earning more money in other states (doesn't matter if it's you or your wife), you can owe more tax in the states that do have an income tax. "
ktfzh64338,"I think the point is that since only one share was bought, only one share would have a disallowed loss. Actually not even a whole share.... not sure how that works.

If you are eligible to open a HSA (you have a qualifying HDHP), and the HSA has good investment options/low fees, I would max that out before any other retirement savings."
ktfzh64338,"You sound a little confused. 

Converting a traditional 401k to Roth 401k isn't a backdoor anything, that's just a fully taxable conversion. 

There is such a thing as ""After-tax"" 401k which you can do conversion to Roth 401k, (this is known as a mega backdoor roth). 

If you're not trying to do any ""backdoor"" and just want to convert your traditional 401k to Roth funds, that's up to your employer's plan. If they allow conversions (sounds like they don't), you could convert your 401k to a Roth 401k (and pay tax). If they allow in-service distributions, you can rollover to a tIRA and then convert that tIRA to a Roth IRA, paying taxes on all the converted amount. 

Many plans don't allow in-service distributions, meaning you cannot rollover out of the plan so long as you remain employed by the company. You'd have to leave your job to rollover the 401k funds. "
ktfzh64338,"Assume rates do go up significantly, how aggressively would you be able to pay down the mortgage, assuming you do end up staying there for the full 10 years?

Do you think you'd be able to payoff all or most of the balance by the time the rate resets (e.g. do you have any significant other assets like investments)? If you could, than the ARM seems much less risky.

I bought a couple years ago at 3.5% fixed, I didn't even think about ARM since I just associated it in my mind with foreclosures and people who couldn't afford their mortgage, though if I could go back I would seriously reconsider it, since I've got a significant pile of assets I could use to pay down most of the mortgage if I wanted to.

If so, I don't think knowingly providing bad payment information to them is going to save you. 

If they want to play hardball, they can just keep accumulating your fees, failed payment surcharges, late payment surcharges, let it accumulate for a while into a nice sum and then dump a mess of unpaid bills all into collections and wreck your credit. "
ktfzh64338,"I did it once every month or two for a while (~10 minute call to Fidelity, no paperwork), but eventually Fidelity started offering us automatic conversions, so now I don't have to do anything and it's automatically converted the day after the contribution. 

"
ktfzh64338,"&gt; Or why would someone invest in this?

Snazzy marketing. 

Hard to really compare risk levels without multiple PhDs in economics, but I don't think this is the product for you if you want to purchase a house in a year or two. 

"
ktfzh64338,"&gt; Once the limit is reached, will the post-tax distribution still take 14% of my paycheck, remove the taxes to be paid, and deposit the remainder into the 401k? Ie, assuming no changes otherwise, my net paycheck will remain the same.

I'd be very surprised if that was the case, in my provider (Fidelity) you choose different contribution percentages for 401k vs AfterTax 401k vs Roth 401k. "
ktfzh64338,"I guess I don't really understand what some of your columns mean. You say that after B goes to 0, the total savings should increase, but you've literally defined total savings as ""last years savings + B"". Don't you have to add-in the interest earned by your savings somewhere?"
ktfzh64338,"A few months back a few interest rate hikes were expected in 2019, though I think the current 'consensus' on wall street is now that there are no longer any more hikes expected this year, with a small chance of a rate cut. Of course this is all just educated guessing. CD rates might still climb slightly, but I wouldn't expect any more big jumps this year. 

If you're not comfortable with investing or if this is your emergency fund, 2.85% seems like a pretty good place to park some cash for a year. 

This would be a very conservative/safe choice. "
Takegoodwithbad,"Just FYI, giving her loan--very good intentioned--will cause an indescribable strain on your relationship.  If you give her a loan consider it not to be paid back.
It would be safe if you both sign a contract to pay you back once she has found employment/income and an x percentage/amount to slowly pay you back."
Takegoodwithbad,This might sound ridiculous but does grocery sales tax or monthly car payment loans count as a tax deduction It's my first time using tax deductions but it seems the definition is vague and also varies from state to state.  So i don't want to fil in some bs numbers.  FYI i live in WA. 
Takegoodwithbad,"I'd set a timeline to get out of that house. Your instincts are spot on that his behavior is inappropriate and...well, sounds like a alittle weirdo.  I think set  a goal to move out with your friend or have our financial savvy family/frien help you know how much to save to leave. It'll take your mom likely five times longer than you to fully realize his behavior. Do you have the patience to stick around for that epiphany? "
Takegoodwithbad,"I'm a govt worker and concerned about what my finance options are if this govt shutdown continues long into January?

I'm coming back from vacation tomorrow. What are the options financially to sustain and cover bills/expenses if this continues? 


Also, for govt workers that had to work without pay or will receive no pay due to this shutdown i send my best wishes.

I'm new to all this as a new employee so i don't have savings yet. I have enough funds to last the month but from credit cards. And I do not want to dip into further debt.  

Monthly payments: 
Rent: $800 (with a not govt worker-roommate who pays $600 for $1400 total)
Car: $230
Electric: $110
Internet: $60


Netpay $2100"

Takegoodwithbad,"Sorry you're being dragged through shit.  But numbers are great to look at objectively and trust when you can't trust your emotions. What's your expense, income. 

Good for you not assuring debt. But this fact can change fast quitting.  

What's for job and how long have you been there? Would someone give you a good review for a new job?"
Takegoodwithbad,I was a student last year  and just rent home. I had expenses to move to WA for a job. Would that qualify? I haven't added anything in the deduction tax section. What generally qualifies as a deductable most individuals miss?
Takegoodwithbad,"At the very LEAST get last year's truck if you want new.  Not 2019, 2020. Just it going off the car dealership drops painfully in value.  And a car will usually last you 10-15 years in great condition and you maintain it.  Not a lifetime thing. 

But i suggest used Tacoma.  Like this: https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/l-Used-2012-Toyota-Tacoma-c23123#listing=231043925

Good luck, man."
Takegoodwithbad,Sales.  I guess my question is what qualifies as a deduction for federal and state? Funny how something like this wasn't taught in my college of business courses yet i know calculus. 🤔 i think I'll take an online tax course.  
Takegoodwithbad,"If you're picking between these two careers, computer science is a safer bet.  I've managers in the private and public sector fighting over developers and coders. Don't worry about a prestigious school unless you're staying in the education system or politics as a career.  
Maybe stick general course credits your first 2 years of college and try a coding course and aviation--or even do extra circular activities in those two fields.  Trust me. It'll be clearer what you want after some sampling. Extra curricular activities/work experirnce gave me a job that i love by the time i graduated. Why pick these two fields in particular?"
Takegoodwithbad,"Ill double check with management. They left it off with ""it depends"" the day before my vacation. No call so far about shutdown so so first day back will be interesting. But I'm designing a savings plan spreadsheet so I have that emergency funding and NOT depending on credit cards. Thx"
Takegoodwithbad,Yes. If you can wrote  a persuasive proposal of how your skills are needed and the promotion doca then you're likely to receive it. BUT it often takes 2-4 months to get onboarding (first day on job). Sometimes the supervisor who hired you can help advise because HR doesn't always communicate very well with its code supervisors. 
Takegoodwithbad,"
I just love you're defending the cat as its guardian.

Do youve friends to stay with while your stepdad and mom settle their emotions? Maybe wait couple days then talk to your mom about future plans fot what you both wish for the other?
 
Maybe plan a time frame with her about moving out or logistics on the cat.  Seems like a lot of misunderstanding going on. Im sorry you're going through this.

throwaway_eng_fin,"You should compare funds in the same company.  Fidelity has total market index funds with similar expense ratios (FSKAX).

Fidelity's 500 index fund will not perform exactly the same as Vanguard's 500 index fund.  Even after fees, vanguard is probably 0.01-0.02% ahead, unless fidelity has gotten drastically better at indexing in the last 6-12 months.

S&amp;P 500 was good advice back when indexing was more expensive.  Today, it's less relevant because it's not so expensive to track total market."
throwaway_eng_fin,"Personally I always sell all rsu as soon as possible and invest back in total market index funds.  And something like 40% of my total comp is from RSU, so I am deep into this brand of Kool-Aid.

It's taxed like ordinary income on vesting, so it's exactly the same as a cash bonus.  I don't spend my cash on company stock, so I also sell rsu asap.

It does literally double the amount of time it takes me to file taxes, since I have to enter like 20 god damn 1099-b entries and check my math.  But, oh well."
throwaway_eng_fin,"Ah I think I understand.

TurboTax wants you to enter things you'd get from a 1099-B and won't let you directly edit your 8949?

If so you probably just need to translate back between the codes and what they correspond to on 1099-B:

https://twonline-18.taxwise.com/Help/WebHelp/Content/IRS%20Codes/English/Miscellaneous_Codes/Form_8949_Columns_(b)_and_(g)_Codes.htm

Some of those options would come in a dialog box after entering things - e.g. ""was there a wash sale adjustment"" or something."
throwaway_eng_fin,"&gt; I’m still taxed on any and all gains, so I guess that means you pay the taxes out of pocket with separate funds from the dividends? Or is that a matter of personal choice? My fear would be dumping a bunch of money into it, having a good return and then having a heavy tax burden on top of it. Am I understanding that correctly?

Either one you want.  You can either reinvest dividends automatically and pay out of pocket (either with increased paycheck withholding, or estimated taxes), or you can have dividends go to settlement fund, pull out the right amount for taxes, and then reinvest the rest manually.

Really though, the dividend tax hit is not bad, and almost not noticeable until you have a lot of taxable stuff.

Say you have a quarter of a *million* in taxable investments and it's all in total market equities, the tax drag is like less than a thousand per year if you're in the 15% bracket.

(Also this is the importance of like not holding REIT in taxable, because the tax drag gets a lot larger)"
throwaway_eng_fin,"If you're going to finish out your career as a doctor and end up with &gt;&gt;$100k taxable income in retirement (easily possible I guess?), then yes I'd go just roth right now.

As soon as you get to 300k, probably you want as much traditional space as possible (though IRA will still have to be roth due to income limits).

Also check out whitecoatinvestor.com now."
throwaway_eng_fin,"&gt; Can I rollover my pretax IRA contributions to my 401k, leaving only my after tax contributions remaining in my traditional IRA?

Yes (though doing it the other way around might be easier)

Basically just roll over however much to leave your IRA with the after-tax basis indicated by your last filed 8606.  Everything else is considered pretax (even gains from after-tax contributions).

So say you have $50k in your IRA and your last 8606 basis is $5k (line 14 or whatever).  Then you would roll over $45k to your 401k, leaving $5k to convert to Roth without incurring any tax.

Alternatively, and probably better, just convert the roth first (since you know the exact basis $$), and make sure to rollover the rest to a 401k before Dec31.  All that matters is that you clear out your pretax $$ by Dec31, the order doesn't matter beyond that.

Also if you contribute more during the year you do the conversion, that can of course be converted to Roth too, just remember to file 8606 again."

throwaway_eng_fin,"Ok the spreadsheet you linked has a lower HELOC rate than your primary mortgage rate.

That would be one reason.  If you can get a lower HELOC rate (and somehow can't refinance even lower?), then the math might be favorable."
throwaway_eng_fin,"&gt; you ever think you will be in a higher bracket than that in retirement (you probably won't be), then go with pre-tax

It's an even harder bar to clear - you need your effective tax rate in retirement to be higher than your marginal tax rate now.

So for example my marginal rate is 32% but my effective rate is like 21%.  Makes the math incredibly difficult to work out in favor of Roth."
throwaway_eng_fin,"You don't have enough income to max out 401k and IRA.  (Maybe do IRA first)

throwaway_eng_fin,"TDFs are index funds.  They are ~""perfectly"" diversified already. If you don't want bonds in your taxable brokerage, you can just mimick the VTSAX/VTIAX split - 60/40.  Maybe around 2030 or 2025 start thinking about bond allocation.

TDFs would be lazier of course.

VT is also a lazy option that has no bonds"
throwaway_eng_fin,"The main difference is VT/VTWAX doesn't have as much small cap coverage I think.  It's a very small difference (&lt;5% or whatever).

It also has 0.02x% higher expense ratio.  Over decades that is less than 1% difference so also not big difference.

Personally I prefer just VTWAX, but I value simplicity.  I also use basically just one credit card, never churn, don't switch banks for higher interest rates, use target date fund in my 401k, etc."

The 15% tax bracket is large, so you could just sell enough to pad that whole bracket every year.  (Sell stock until income + stock sold is about half a million in one year - cut a check to the IRS for 15% of the sale that quarter in an estimated payment)

I’ve been trying to advise him to not do this and to just save . But it’s hard for me to explain why it’s not a good idea . Also Maybe I’m wrong and it’s not such a bad thing . 

He is 35 years old and has 75k in his 401k . Can someone help me with an explanation?"
3ofakind85,"I have a 30 ft 5th wheel it’d be tough to live in for me for an extended amount of time , but I have a family . How will you get the trailer to the spot your keeping it ? I know you say your in Texas but does it ever dip below freezing at all to freeze the pipes ? We love our camper but I will say they drop like a rock in value ."
3ofakind85,I also see some calculating how much house they can afford with gross monthly income . For example 100k a year is 8333 monthly which 30percent would be 2500 a month mortgage. I always thought it was net income .

If a family had an net income of 7600 per month  they would want to be around 2280 mortgage.

Now another family with with the same income had two 300 dollar car payments , would they still be ok spending the 2280  or 30% on a home ? "

3ofakind85,"This is not my situation, we thankfully paid our vehicles off . But it seems that if the family with the two car payments can afford the 25-30% mortgage with the car payments .Then the other without a car payment would be ok spending 35% on there mortgage? "

ohn900,"No it won't. I clearly said I want it as a backup in case I can't do things manually. I don't have enough in my checking account to pay the statement balance without moving money each month from my high interest savings account. That's why I want it to pay the minimum due, in case I'm in a coma or something and can't move money to my checking, there is still enough in the checking to cover a few months of minimum payments. "
ohn900,"How about this. They know exactly when a bill is late, yes? So if their system can see a bill is due tomorrow and will be late, make an auto-pay today for the minimum amount. That really shouldn't be difficult. Bill will be late tomorrow, if yes, auto-pay. "
ohn900,"Discover Bank Online - 2 questions I'm considering a Discover Savings Account and had 2 quick questions. 

1. If I recall correctly, I thought there used to be a referall link mentioned on here that would give you a slightly higher interest rate if you opened the account using that referral link. But for the life of me I can't find it. Perhaps I'm mistaken? 

2. For those that have it, can anyone clarify if you can link an external *savings* account? I know some online banks only let you link to an external checking account, so I was curious if Discover let's you link to an external savings account as well?"
ohn900,"Well 1. Every time lately I try to use that site I have a problem. Most recently where Equifax said I have to mail in documents...I'd like to just have a hassle free account where I can log in each month...not deal with the nonsense the credit bureaus keep causing me. 2. If something does go wrong, that means I may have to try to fight something that happened 11 months earlier. I'd prefer to keep a closer eye on things if possible. "
ohn900,"You aren't doing the math right. First off, some months I have things like insurance due, which makes some months closer to $2,000-3,000. That's $40-60 a year. But, I would want around 6 months covered in the event something happened and I couldn't handle my finances, so that's closer to $250-350 a year lost. "
ohn900,"I'm not sure why this is difficult to understand. I want to keep as much as possible in my high interest savings account so I can get as much interest as possible, instead of keeping a lot in my checking account. I do transfer from savings to checking each month as I clearly stated...but if I'm in a coma, then I can't transfer the money I need for that month from savings to checking. Hence why I want it to pay the minimum due if I haven't already. "
ohn900,"Normally I pay the full credit card bill each month. However, in an emergency like I'm in a coma or something, I want it to automatically take the minimum due because I don't keep a lot of money in my checking account, I transfer what I need to my checking account each month. Additionally, some cards only let you select the payment due date as the auto-pay day, which I wouldn't want in case something went wrong. "
ohn900,"Not exactly. If I an insurance payment is due or I make an unexpected purchase and something happens before I move the additional money over, then I'd be screwed. I want the backup to be automated or else it really isn't a backup. "
ohn900,"Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I never got an email. The phone rang just as it loaded the screen asking if I wanted to open a checking account, so I didn't click yes for probably 15 minutes...it probably timed out, although it would have been nice if it said that! "
ohn900,"Too many variables? It should be simple as anything...If I made a payment on a bill that is due, no auto-pay on the due date. If I didn't make a payment by the due date, auto-pay the minimum due. Real simple. If they can figure out when a bill is late, they can figure this out. "
DanvilleDad,"You did the right thing by focusing on price not payments.

The problem is you didn’t come with your own financing. Here’s a good rule for next time: go to your bank or credit union (or a few of them) and get prequalified. Typically you will have a letter that outlines what you’re approved for.

When the dealer offers you a rate, take it if and only if it is better than what you brought with you.

For the current situation, you can see if it’s possible to refinance the vehicle into a better rate with another lender.

Good luck.

Edit: clarification in 3rd paragraph.

"
DanvilleDad,"You would probably end up paying more on the note than you pay in rent.

35,000 / 5 years / 12 months = $583/month ... and that is just principal.

Maybe you can get a longer term (maybe) but do you really want to live on a camper for that long?"
DanvilleDad,"This is a relatively inexpensive lesson and I wouldn’t fight it. I’m not saying it’s right, just that the facts presented don’t give a clear indication that you indeed did cancel and that the company isn’t honoring the cancellation request. If you had an email, that would be different."
DanvilleDad,"I’m assuming you are in active military service for the US armed forces? If yes, thank you for your service to our country.

I don’t know the details of the policy but sounds like your situation is exactly why someone would buy this product.

I’m appalled that a company with “American” in their name would put you in the situation described. I would appeal the decision and write a polite and concise letter to someone senior within the organization - and send it certified mail or FedEx so you know they will get it and read it.

I would be surprised if a company like AIG would want a PR nightmare for failing a US active duty serviceman.

DanvilleDad,"Check out the “prime directive” as a good baseline if you haven’t yet read it.

Personally, I’d pay off that student debt before getting a mortgage. I’d also wait to be a landlord until you have a bigger cash cushion... in a duplex situation you have not only your own home to care for, but a second oven, hot water heater, dishwasher, washer, dryer, etc ... and when those items break, you need to replace them.

Overall, good for you loading up the Roth and having a plan to own property."
DanvilleDad,"A CPA would be good from a tax perspective, but not likely for investment advice. If you’re not comfortable investing on your own, find a few fee only advisors, interview them and go with someone you like. But you likely don’t need to be paying an on going fee for advice."
DanvilleDad,"This. Plus if you don’t like the annual fee you can easily downgrade to a free chase credit card. When I signed up it was $1,500 in points ..... they’ve ratcheted that down to $750 (assumes you book through their platform) ... well worth it."
DanvilleDad,"Sounds good ... and while finance is loaded with jargon to make it sound really complex, it can be distilled down to a few important concepts and you should be able to take a DIY approach. Asset allocation, time horizon, fees are some important places to focus your attention. You could save yourself a boatload over a lifetime of investing."
DanvilleDad,"Congrats!

Make sure you’re building an emergency fund ... pregnancy / delivery / kids are expensive from a health care perspective.

Save for your retirement first, once you’re on track there, a 529 is a “nice to have” if you think your little one will be heading to college.

Also all the gear adds up ... stroller, car seat, crib, changing table .... there’s simply so much stuff.

Lastly, get your sleep now!



"
DanvilleDad,"Why not?

Look no one ever plans for the worst, but there’s a more orderly and defined way to split assets if the house is purchased when married and then there’s a divorce. It’s the Wild West if it’s a couple with *plans* to be married that needs to unwind a large transaction but doesn’t have a legal contract outlining who contributed what, how the transaction gets unwound, etc. If there’s no stopping or delaying this purchase, I would recommend having a lawyer draw up some docs that addresses the low probability but highly impactful event of not ending up getting married and living happily ever after.

So we have 1 joint account and all our joint bills come out of that, and we each deposit our amount each month and everything works out fine. Whatever else is left out is the respective persons to do with what they want. IDK if you guys are married or planning life together yet or are just moving in together, but at some point (after marriage most likely) you'll want to add joint savings and savings for expenses into the same formula (saving for a house, vacation, etc)"
m_d_f_l_c,"Sell house, take 60k in equity (minus back pay on mortgage, relator fees, etc) = 50k maybe. Pay 10k CC = 40k left. 5k + whatever she can trade/sell her current failing car for for a reliable new-to-her car = 35k left. 5k in bank for emergency fund. 30k to rent a place and hold her over until she gets a job. Once employment is secured she can start rebuilding. 

This puts her in a much better/pretty good situation:

No CC debt

No mortgage debt

5k emergency fund

30k for rent/living until a job is found (if rent + living expenses are 2000/month, that gives her 15 months to find a job, should be doable)

Reliable car (paid for with no payment)"
m_d_f_l_c,"Check you lease. Most places have a few day grace period from the due date (it was 5 days at my last rental). You may be able to just pay it 5 days late and everything be fine. And even after the grace period its usually just a late fee everyday, which you could also just pay if you have to.

Might also be able to just make a partial payment, and pay the rest when you get it. "
m_d_f_l_c,"Yea my old car was 108hp, had to turn the AC off to maintain speed up hills on the highway lol.... For $10k I'm.more than happy. It has heated/cooled seats, Bluetooth, etc. Not bad for a 2007.... 0-60 is like 4.7s, but because of the big engine highway speeds it where it really shines. Gets 20-25mpg highway too depending on how ""spirirted"" I drive...It looks kinda like a grandpa car but can beat a lot of cars out there without much effort. A real sleeper. I like it. Only downfall is, obviously it's a used luxury cars so its bound to break at some point and when it does it will be pricey. But I knew that going into it.


Edit: have you looked into a 201X Kia optima w/turbo? They're around 280 hp stock , reliable, comfortable, most modern conviniences, can get another 50-70hp with just a tune and intake. And are probably around 10-14k depending on features miles etc"
m_d_f_l_c,"That doesnt leave you $10k short, that'll leave ya $12k up! You can get tons of nice cars for $12k! .... But you're not going to listen to some guy on the internet.... Yea you can trade in the cruize on the gti, and take out a loan for the remaining hopefully $15kish.... Is it the best financial descision? No.... No not really. But not the end of the world.

The MOST financially responsible answer (which is what this sub likes) is to keep saving money, and drive the cruize until it shits the bed... Then take the money you saved + whatever you can get for the cruize at that point and buy a car cash for that amount..."
m_d_f_l_c,"I was in your shoes, I took the loans, it was what I had to do to stay enrolled and afford to have a roof over my head. For me, it was worth it many times over, even with my massive loan amounts. I am pretty sure I would not be where I am not if I hadn't gone that path. If you know you will be able to get a job job, making good money, with this degree, I would take the loans and focus on graduating

Also, I was a B/C/D student my first 2 years of school before I buckled down and got A/B's for the remainder.... But my gpa was already poop from the first years grades. Graduated just under a 3.0, which is B- to C+ range... Thing is though, no one has ever asked about my grades and in the real world, experience and good personal skills are way more important that grades. My.grades have never come up."
m_d_f_l_c,"call ask for the billing department, or just go into the hospital in person. Tell them you dont have insurance.... that alone may chop 50% of the bill, the rest you can set up a payment plan for. I dont know the circumstances of you not having insurance but you might be able to retoractivley get cobra insurance coverage, but youd have to google it and see if you are eligible, and that would probably bring it down under $1k if you could do that


edit: actually cobra may only be if you lose insurance from an employer, not from your parents. but still google around, I am pretty sure there is some kind of retroactive coverage you can get somehow through obamacare or cobra or something...."
m_d_f_l_c,"You are 100% not going to listen to this, BUT if I were you, I would keep the job, and maybe just see if you can work less (or muster up more energy) so that you can work on the animation as a side project. There are tons of people who make a living on youtube, you could try uploading stuff there to make sure people like it. Maybe itll take off, and youll get millions and can quit your job no problem. Maybe people wont really like it, and you'll still have your job and be OK. 

No where will give you a loan with 0 income. So if you NEED to get a loan, you would have to get it BEFORE you quit.

Edit: Another option, is save $25k this year, so that in 2020 you can quit AND have your $25k you need to live off of/fund your project. "
m_d_f_l_c,"&gt;I'm 22 and my plan was to take $5k-10k and invest it or play around in the market. 

Your gunna lose it most likley.

&gt;If we lose $5-$10k that's fine as I see it as tuition for me to study the market. 

It is their money, not yours, why would they let you do this? Also, you dont need to lose $10k to ""study the market"". Read a book, make trades with a fake/practice account for  a while!


&gt;any ideas what I should do with this money?

Unless your parents specifically said, ""we have $190k ear-marked for you to do whatever you see fit with, and already have enough money to not worry about money for the rest of our lives"", why are you doing anything with it?"
m_d_f_l_c,"75k wont go very far. I would stash 10k away as an emergency fund, and just invest the rest and let it grow for 10-30 years to help with retirement. But your main focus should be finding a new job that doesnt need that much movement (secretary, accountant, basically any office job, programmer, etc etc). There are plenty of jobs that can be done without being able to walk at all that make great money. "
m_d_f_l_c,"It includes a down payment of 20%. So, I would think 360k - portion for down payment (72k) +300k down payment. So if you have 300k to put down (and want to use it all for a house down payment), 500-600k would probably be safe."
m_d_f_l_c,"this happened to us when we got an even lesser amount as a gift from a grandparent on our first house. Banks get really skeeved out when money shows up from no-where (could it have been from selling illegal drugs?! stolen money from theft?!) usually not, but the banks want evidence that the money came from a legitimate source before accepting it, just to cover their asses. This is required of all ""non-seasoned"" money. Our lender said the seasoning lookback is 3 months. So if you had gotten it 3 months prior to when they checked, they wouldnt question it."
m_d_f_l_c,"If the car is free, take it and drive it. Fix it when it breaks, itll still be cheapers than any car with a car payment. Its a deisel too they tend to be more reliable. Plus if the car is free just take it and drive it until a huge repair comes up.... then sell it and roll that into something else, youd still be better off than not taking it."
m_d_f_l_c,"at 240k, after deducting the standard deduction of 24k, if you maxed out your 401ks (37k) wouldnt your modified gross income be under the 199k (240 - 24 - 37 = 179k before any other deductions like childcare credit, other taxes paid, mortgage interest/deductions,etc) qualify you to be able to do 2 roths as-well?

1) Does that mean we can't contribute to IRA?

&gt; I think when you file you may find your MAGI might be close or under the limit and still allow you to make IRA contribution, youll have to start filing and see. 


2) Is maxing out 401k a great option no matter what? Should I?

&gt; I would always max it out, especially if you cant qualify for other tax advantaged accounts like IRAs

3) Traditional vs 401K, Which one do I choose? (Sorry I am still learning)

&gt; Not sure what you mean here

4) Contributed 3k to IRA in 2018 even though I am not allowed to. What do I do?


&gt; IF you determine you actually arent eligible, which as I said I think you still may end up being eligible, then you can request a withdraw on the reason of contribution. You can withdraw and get it back without penalty,but have to before april 15th (https://investor.vanguard.com/ira/excess-contribution)

SuperMirage,"After years of not paying enough attention, I've learned that working a plan to be debt-free is a key foundation for financial success. I've paid on 30-year mortgages for too long, and am sick of sending that much of my income to a bank.

Working a 15-year mortgage as part of an overall plan gives a better timeframe toward getting completely out of debt. I've learned to value that approach more than taking on the risk of staying in debt to try to make the spread of a few percent on investments."
SuperMirage,"Congrats on the great income, it sounds like an excellent chance to to grow and build a lot of wealth.

In your situation, I'm working a plan to use my great income, amazing bonus, and non-retirement funds to wipe out the $65k student loans in under 12 months.

Then I'd rebuild my EF to 6 months expenses, be saving at least 15% for retirement, and build a big down payment for a home.

Avoid debt and keep your liabilities low, and you're well positioned to build massive wealth. Nicely done."
SuperMirage,"Moving down to from a 4Runner to a Corolla doesn't sound fun in Alaska (or anywhere)..

Not enough math here to give data-based thought..

* How much of your monthly budget does $500 in gas make up?
* Do you have a need for the $8k you'd get out of it? i.e. other consumer debt, etc
* What's your career/income track? On track or able to increase income, work overtime etc?

In your situation, I don't think I do this deal unless it addresses another significant financial need or goal."
SuperMirage,"I've found that getting out and staying out of debt helps my budget have the room to pay a mortgage and build wealth. Juggling a mortgage with other debt doesn't work.

In your position, I'd tap the brakes on the house, pay off the car today, wipe out the student loans as soon as possible, then rebuild the EF to 6 months expenses. That puts you in a great position to save for a down payment and buy a house."
SuperMirage,"In your position, I'd determine a cash budget, and find the nicest car I could find on something like Craigslist for that price. Your best insurance to avoid inheriting problems is to pay a mechanic that you trust $75 for a pre-purchase inspection.

I think CPO tends to be a bit overrated, and with your numbers, CPO cars will be well outside of your cash price range."
SuperMirage,"You're in a great place and well on track. A focus on staying debt-free will serve you well and help you build wealth quickly through life.

From what I'm seeing, your first priorities are:

* Allocate 3-6 months expenses as your emergency fund
* Save to cashflow the Master's program, taking on no debt

Above that, you might contribute any extra to a Roth IRA. That should get you through the next two years.

You're doing great, keep up the good work."
SuperMirage,"r/DaveRamsey

Dream for a moment.. Imagine you are 40, completely out of a debt, with a fully-funded emergency fund, and a down payment for a home. That's attainable.

It's never too late, especially at 35. You make too much money to be this broke. No more borrowing money. No credit repair companies.

A budget, plan, and short term pain will clean this up and set you on a path to success. You can do this."
SuperMirage,"That new Accord 2.0T is a pretty sweet car.

Would it be a reasonable for your income level? Yes, I think so.

Could you buy it and be ok making a payment? Probably, yes.

Should you buy it now? I wouldn't. I'd first clean up the student loans, bump up the EF, and I wouldn't taken on car debt and $400 payment to get it."
SuperMirage,"Reducing the interest rate would be nice, but moving debt doesn't accomplish much. 15 years of payments on non-mortgage debt isn't appealing. There is also risk of moving debt onto your home.

What is your annual household income? Do you have any non-retirement savings?"
SuperMirage,"If you have zero e-fund, I'd set aside at least $1k, and throw the rest at the debt.

That'd leave you with $21k in debt. Making $85k, living on a budget at home with tiny expenses, you can clean that up in no time."
SuperMirage,"No. Whole Life Insurance is one of the worst financial products. It's sold as an ""investment"", but gains are extremely low, and accessing your own money down the line requires a loan and is charged interest. When you die, the policy pays only face value, and the insurance company keeps all the gains. The premium is also 10x term life insurance. Heck with that.

If you need life insurance, buy 15-20 year term. Do your investing with investments. Don't mix the two.

In your shoes, I'd call and cancel this policy as soon as possible, and be grateful you're out of it now instead of 40 years from now."
SuperMirage,"&gt;This isn't a good mind set at all. 

Could OP keep the loan to invest and get a few percent more returns? Maybe yes, maybe no. That assumes no risk on what sounds like a single stock investment.

The point is that each day where the loan is kept when there are funds available to pay it off is the same math as borrowing on the loan to invest.

&amp;#x200B;"
SuperMirage,"&gt; $170k in student loan debt  
&gt;  
&gt; I currently make roughly $42k/year

Gulp. I hope your plan comes together and your income is on track to quadruple in the next few years.

You are broke, and not in a position to invest. As your income increases, I'd focus all energy on cleaning this mess up as quickly as possible. Don't let the debt drag on for 10 years.

I wouldn't stay out of investing forever, but you're not in a position where it makes sense today.

SuperMirage,"Your $5k will buy a much more solid car than a two-decade old Camry.

If you have $5k cash for a down payment, you should be buying the best $5k car in cash that you can find, and avoiding financing &amp; monthly payments."
SuperMirage,"I'd look a priority list order like:

1. A plan to cashflow school and don't take on more debt.
2. Pay off car
3. Build emergency fund

If #1 &amp; #2 didn't work together, I'd start looking at the cost &amp; value of this car to see if getting out of it would help achieve #1."
SuperMirage,"&gt;14 CC + 6 car + 10 to private loans (my original plan)

This is exactly what I would do in your situation.

Then full steam ahead on the balance of those student loans. Get them out of your life.

&amp;#x200B;"
SuperMirage,"Taking on new car debt while in debt on a car, credit cards, and collections is not wise. Sign up bonuses and cashback rewards will not help you build wealth.

Your best individual move is to start living on a written, monthly budget. Focus on cleaning up your debt, get out of this car loan, then work a plan to move up into the next car with cash.

From what you describe, neither of you are financially in a position to move up in car."
SuperMirage,"&gt;debt free in about 7 months

This is the plan I would follow in your situation.

You're right that $3k is not enough of an EF. That amount is not meant to be comfortable. To help think through that, I'd ask how many times have you experience a $3k emergency in the last seven months?

I'd clean this up as quickly as possible, bump up a full EF by end of year, and move on to financial goals to help you build wealth.

&amp;#x200B;"
SuperMirage,"10-12x your income on you, and 10-12x her income on her. Children don't change that formula from my perspective. 

15-20 year term life for young, healthy people is cheap. It's not an emergency, but I would get it in place now.

And don't let them sell you whole life insurance."
SuperMirage,"If you have the cash, it's always a good day to become debt-free.

Your credit score might dip a little, but with regular payments, it will return. Being on a healthy financial plan to reduce debt and build wealth is more important than the daily changes of one's credit score."
SuperMirage,"&gt; why doesn’t it feel like I am getting ahead? 

In my experience, not keeping a written monthly budget and trying to reach too many goals at once are the cause of this.

With your numbers, your goals are attainable. Set up a budget and plan and you will know when you're positioned to buy.

In your position, I'd:

1. Start a written monthly budget today. Keep a budget every month going forward
2. As soon as the tax refund is in hand, take it and sell $11k of the stock to be 100% debt free
3. Finish building the EF to 6 months expenses
4. Build as big of a pile of cash for a down payment as possible. 20% or more should be the goal
5. Balance contributing to retirement with #4 to your tolerance of building down payment vs retirement savings

igottheblues1,"should I take out a heloc to pay off credit card debt along with kitchen reno? Right now I have 3 credit card balances. Card A is my everyday card and cards B and C are balance transfers currently at 0%.

I have 2500 on card A, 4500 on card B and 5000 on card C for a total of 12,000 total debt. I was considering a 50K heloc to pay off the debt as well as to renovate our kitchen.

We have annual income of around 90K after taxes and our house has a 30 year mortgage on it (we are at year 5 now) 

Does anyone have any personal experiences or advice on whether or not this is a good idea? Let me know if additional information is needed, thanks! "
igottheblues1,"we would do a kitchen Reno because we want a nicer, more functional kitchen but it's not an absolute must. our current kitchen works, it's just not an optimal configuration.

I'm also looking for a new job so that this may not become an issue however I'd like to think about all scenarios to help plan.

vgacolor,Pretty much everyone lost money in the market during the 4th Qtr. December was a killer specially the 24th. As long as the new Vanguard fund is in equities (stocks) then you have nothing to worry about. Both funds should have gone up during the last two months.
vgacolor,"It is unlikely that you can negotiate that. The matching is company wide not individually set. However, you can use the differential to negotiate a small increase.

I do not think you are right about the standard being 10-15%, Most plans match around what they are offering.

&gt; 49% of employers with 401K plans match 0% 41% match a percentage of employee contributions between 0-6% of salary. 10% match a percentage of employee contributions at 6% or more of salary. The median is a 3% match...

[https://20somethingfinance.com/401k-match/](https://20somethingfinance.com/401k-match/)"
vgacolor,"Why can't you do both? The whole not matching until a year later sucks, but certainly not saving 4% of your salary for a year will not pay down the $8k in debt much unless you are making $100K+ a year"
vgacolor,"If you are certain that you will not need the money for three years, but that you will certainly need it in three years then I would not put it in a bond fund. Specially not in one that has medium to longer term bonds as the majority of its holdings. The reason is that three years down the line, the interest rates might be significantly higher and that would mean that the bonds will have a lower value. Maybe an ever lower value than what you paid for them. This value drop might erode the interest income that you made during the prior three years.  

The way around it is to buy either specific bonds that have a three year maturity or a bond fund that invest mostly in short term funds. Of course the trade off is that shorter maturities pay lower yields than longer maturities."
vgacolor,"BLK S&amp;P/TSX Comp Index &lt;- Should be one of the most diversified and with low cost. At your age, I would be 100% in equity and maybe put in a bit more than 4% from your pocket if you can."
vgacolor,"What are his total debts and his total income? What are the interest rates on his debt? How about expenses?

I think that as long as you know that you will most likely not see that money for a long time and are ok with that then sure you can help. However, all of these past due credits are a symptom of a cash flow problem {expenses are higher than take home income}.  

If you decide to help, and you can not wipe everything out then you need to be surgical as to which debts you will be able to pay that would help him get to a sustainable level of cash flow that helps him take care of the rest of the debts."
vgacolor,"Where do you have your bank account?  Last time I went to Canada, I had CAD$800 left and after I crossed into Washington State I stopped by a Chase branch and had the teller change it.

I have an account in Chase in another State and all they needed was my name, social, and an ID to look me up. This was a town close to the border but you should be able to do it in any big city."
vgacolor,"Agree with this, the parents should rent from now on. Also what kind of mortgage leaves you with a $600 monthly payment?  Do they account for insurance and taxes? Even with a $100,000 mortgage they are looking at about $800 a month.  Instead they should find a place that costs around $1,200 a month in rent and live there. The $50,000 saved in the down payment will cover the difference for ten years."
vgacolor,"I read earlier that the first mortgage is almost paid off, which means the 2nd mortgage lender probably has a lot of equity to go after. So the answer is that they will most likely go after the house.  

How much is the total debt on the house?  
How much is the house worth?    
When you tried refinancing, did you try refinancing only the second or refinancing both out and granting the new lender the senior lien? 
  
How about selling the house to you so that you can be primary?"
vgacolor,"No because the whole premise is to buy out of the money put options to keep your hedging costs under control. There is no way that you can hedge with an in the money option for 3%. That might cost you twice the amount so you pay 6% to hedge, the market goes down 5% you exercise the option so you make up the loss in market value but you don't get the 6% cost to hedge back. In this scenario you lose 6%."

vgacolor,"&gt;Water is water in and sewer is water out. In most cases, you pay both. In the case of something like a sprinkler system, the water will go through a different meter and you won't pay sewer for that usage.

There is no meter in the sewer. The utility just assumes that the water coming in is coming out. To me the important thing is that she moved in on 11/1/18 and the bill is for before she moved in."
vgacolor,"Other than driving less..... maybe keeping the tires properly inflated.

&gt; You can improve your gas mileage by 0.6% on average—up to 3% in some cases—by keeping your tires inflated to the proper pressure. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by about 0.2% for every 1 psi drop in the average pressure of all tires. Properly inflated tires are safer and last longer."
vgacolor,"There is also the added benefit that life insurance through work is portable, which means you can keep the coverage if you leave the job. The premium will not be cheap, and usually you are limited to a whole life product.... but it is life insurance that you will not need to qualify for."
vgacolor,"Finding a house that:

Can rent for enough money that covers taxes, insurance, repairs, and a mortgage for 95%+ of the purchase price, while at the same time be in such demand that you will not lack a tenant...... is a very rare house."
vgacolor,"Buying those puts will cost you too much, you might as well not be in stocks. You are not giving up all of the upside of stocks but you are giving up a lot about 3% if you want a put that creates a maximum loss floor of 10% during the next year.  

Good year that has an 8% return means that you are up only 5%
Marginal year that has a 4% return means you make only 1%
Bad year where the market is down 5% means you lost 8%"
vgacolor,"I think the simple answer would be when the interest rate that the municipal bond pays is no more than 22% lower than the taxable bond pays.

Municipal bond pays 4% and Taxable bond pays 4.5% invest in the municipal. Taxable pays more than 5.13% (4% after a 22% tax haircut) invest in the taxable.  There are other factors that can influence it, but they are minor in my opinion to the interest differential."

icemanthrowaway123,"Lot of pieces missing here.

Either you can buy a house with $20k and have enough leftover to be a good safety net OR you're considering strapping yourself into a mortgage while still in school.

Orrrr there's other pieces to this we're not hearing "
icemanthrowaway123,"Yeah this isn't for us.

Go to /r/legaladvice and figure out how to handle the situation with the mortgage company and a divorce where one party is MIA.

During divorce proceedings make sure however the house is handled clearly in writing.

The one personal finance advice we can give you is to start relocating sooner than later. Just because he'll handle payments till August or you'll end up with the house doesn't mean it's a good idea to live with a mortgage over your head that takes 70% of your income. "
icemanthrowaway123,"A quick Google reveals that ""complete payoff"" seems to have a delayed effect for a lot of people, but a positive one in the end.

Immediately though you have less lines of credit and less on time payments to track so it may drop. 24 points seems a tad drastic though. "
icemanthrowaway123,"1. Of course. You're always free to bet against markets, countries, and currencies

2. You recommend big loans and credit so I'm guessing you're betting against the US Dollar(?) or a similar superpower. You're free to try of course but good luck figuring out where to put your money in the event of that happening.

3. If you're interested in researching the biggest success of this, look up George Soros shorting the UK economy. It's an amazing read and the man made close to a billion USD in a single day.

icemanthrowaway123,"Gold is a bad investment because it's too closely tied to whatever currency you're dealing in.

Hoarders impact the price of gold. Hoarders sell when currency drops. Gold drops when currency drops. It's not the safety net people think it is. "

Learn from this lesson and make sure your next few cars are clunkers. Consider ditching the 2018 car if someone will buy it for the remaining principle on the loan even.

As for your question, $12k is a decent safety net. I vote you put as much as possible towards debts as it's the best investment there is. Focus on the higher interest student loans first. Your car loan isn't bad at 1% fixed but I really really think you should try and ditch it. Someone with 12k savings and no big earning job should not be buying a $23,000 car. "

Okay oaklahoma has pretty low property taxes and I'd  imagine around $100/month for a house in that range.

How long is the mortgage though and how big is that down payment? What kind of rate are you getting? If we add these things to your $700 expenses and consider:

- Insurance

- repairs

- other housey expenses

And unless this mortgage has a repay period of 30years+ it makes me very nervous on a $2400 monthly take-home."

68k with a masters in math is great, but if she's about to graduate with an undergrad in a very in-demand field why not move out on her own when she inevitably gets a decent job?

GAULEM,"If I inherited $200k then I would just add it to the index funds in my brokerage account (after paying off the student debt, probably). I don't see the reason to hire an advisor for that amount of cash.

If you want something that'll basically manage itself until you're ready to withdraw, then one option is to open an account at either Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab, and invest the money into a Target Date index fund for the appropriate year. (For example, I'm about 35-40 years away from retirement age, so I have money invested in Vanguard's Target Retirement 2055 fund)."
GAULEM,"&gt;  If I were to keep the shares for one year to make them long term investments,

They might have already reached long-term status. You generally count from the purchase date, not the gift date. (The exception is if you're selling it for a loss, in which case you sometimes have to use the gift value and gift date, instead of the purchase value and purchase date.)

&gt; could I sell them slowly over a few years to keep myself in the 0% tax bracket for capital gains

Probably, yes. For 2019, if your taxable income (including the capital gains) is less than $39375 single or $78750 joint after subtracting whatever deductions, then you shouldn't have to pay any federal income tax on your long-term capital gains.  Note that depending on where you live, you'll probably have to pay state income tax.

&gt; will the entire value of the stock count toward that income if I sell or will it be just the capital gains on the shares I sell (in addition to all the dividends and non-stock income)?

When you sell a stock, only the capital gain counts toward your income."
GAULEM,"From what I recall it's generally accepted that you can't have a wash sale involving a 401(k), so you only need to be concerned with your taxable accounts and the IRAs.

I certainly can't imagine you getting in trouble for declaring the entire thing a wash sale, since if you're wrong that just means you've paid the IRS some extra money."
GAULEM,"Apparently it's linked to the yield of short-term TIPS. It seems like the guy at MyMoneyBlog has been able to predict the fixed rate to within 0.1% a few weeks in advance, so you might want to take a look at his blog: https://www.mymoneyblog.com/category/savings-bonds"
GAULEM,"&gt; Have money market funds ever lost money?

Rarely. From what I understand, there has been exactly one occasion in history when this happened: during the housing crisis about a decade ago. I think the USA treasury ended up reimbursing the loss.

&gt; The funds I have looked at are $100k minimum, does that typically mean that I can open with $100k but then withdraw at any time and keep my balance below $100k?

Going below the minimum may have consequences - I wouldn't be surprised if they force you to sell the remaining amount after a while, for example.

&gt; How often is interest typically paid out (and I assume I will still receive interest on money I withdraw before the interest is paid?)

On a money market fund or bond fund, monthly payment of interest seem to be the norm.

&gt; My investment firm offers many different money market funds at different rates, is there any reason to not just pick the one with the highest interest rate?

A money market fund with a higher rate most likely has riskier holdings, though I think most people still wouldn't consider it particularly risky. Another consideration is that different funds will have different tax treatment for their interest - for example, Vanguard offers a money market fund that's tax-free in California, one that's tax-free in New Jersey, etc."
GAULEM,"&gt; I've been looking at mutual funds and ETFs and it looks like they either lose money or return only about 2-3%

Interest rates have been rising during the past few years. When interest rates go up, people who want to sell their bonds need to lower the price (in order to compete with newer bonds' higher rates), and so bond funds lose value.

I'm not knowledgeable enough to know when interest rates are likely to stop increasing, but when they do, the bond funds will stop going down. The monthly interest/dividend may be enough to offset the loss in value, anyway. I have a 3% unrealized loss in the bond fund I use, but if you include the interest then overall I'm still up.

&gt; Furthermore, it seems they return a paultey dividend of about $0.07.

Whether that's paltry depends on the share price. E.g. a dividend of $0.07/month on a fund that costs $20 per share is very different than on a fund that costs $200 per share."
GAULEM,"~~After looking over Form 1040, I actually don't think they can. Stuff like your wages and ordinary dividends (but not your qualified dividends) get added together on Line 6 of your Form 1040, along with up to -$3000 of capital losses, in order to calculate your ""total income"". If the result is negative, it'll get rounded up to $0 on Line 10, and then it looks like taxes for qualified dividends don't get counted until Line 11a.~~

Edit: Nevermind, on closer inspection I've realized that the value for qualified dividends is included as part of ordinary dividends. So yes, they can."
GAULEM,"The Roth conversion can be done at any time (unless you're trying to do the mega backdoor and there's restrictions on distributions from your 401(k)). But it's generally recommended to do it as soon as possible, since you'll have to pay income tax on any growth that occurred prior to the conversion."
GAULEM,"If you are eligible to deduct traditional IRA contributions for 2018, then you can deduct it when you file your tax return for 2018; otherwise you must report that you made non-deductible contributions. If you are eligible to deduct it, then I believe it's up to you whether or not to do so.

When you file your 2019 taxes you'll report the conversion, and you'll pay taxes on a proportional amount of your IRA balance, based on the amount of the conversion and the fraction of your IRA that was pre-tax/deductible versus non-deductible.

&gt; Side question: now that I set up a Roth IRA, can I just fund it directly from my checking or does this IRA to Roth IRA conversion need to happen every time?

If your income level is low enough that you're eligible to make direct Roth IRA contributions, then you can do so instead of using the backdoor technique. https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/amount-of-roth-ira-contributions-that-you-can-make-for-2019"
GAULEM,"The IRS distinguishes between earned income (from employment) and unearned income (from everything else: interest, capital gains, retirement accounts, etcetera).

Earned income and unearned income are both subject to income tax, but only earned income is subject to FICA taxes, and there are certain things (like the Earned Income Tax Credit, or IRA contributions) that require earned income."
GAULEM,"For 2019, your ability to contribute directly to Roth IRAs becomes limited if your MAGI is more than $122,000. By $137,000 the contribution limit drops all the way to $0. MAGI is based on your gross income for the year, except that some deductions can reduce it and some can't. In particular, pre-tax (traditional) contributions to your 401(k) can reduce your MAGI, but IRA contributions cannot.

There's a method to bypass this limit, called the Backdoor Roth IRA. This works by making non-deductible contributions to a traditional IRA, and then immediately converting to a Roth IRA. This works regardless of how high your MAGI is.

The one major problem with this 'backdoor' technique is that it doesn't really work if you have traditional IRAs, because the Pro Rata rule prevents you from converting the non-deductible funds in that case. For this reason, it might be best to avoid moving your old 401(k) into an IRA. If Fidelity isn't charging you any fees, then leaving it where it is is probably fine. Otherwise, check whether you're able to roll it into your new 401(k)."
GAULEM,"If you use a taxable account then you have to pay taxes on the dividends and interest every year. You also have to pay taxes on capital gains when you sell things for a profit. But some dividends and some capital gains are federally taxed at a lower rate than regular income: 15% for most people, but it can be as low as 0% if you're in the 12% tax bracket or below.

If you put money into a Roth IRA then you don't have to pay taxes on that money ever again, assuming you wait until you're at least 59.5 years old before you withdraw more than you've contributed. But you're only allowed to contribute a limited amount each year - in 2019 the limit is $6000."
GAULEM,"Probably not. Poker could theoretically allow you to make IRA contributions, but only if you're a professional poker player who does it for a living, you have net winnings for the year, and you file a Schedule C and pay FICA taxes on your winnings."
GAULEM,"&gt; I'm assuming it takes x amount of business days for me to actually see the 1200 in my account, once it arrives does Vanguard automatically select mutual funds for me to invest in? 

No, you'll have to select your investments yourself. FYI they generally allow you to select the investments when you initiate the transfer (so you don't necessarily need to wait for the transfer to complete).

&gt; My current pie split is 90,10,0,0 respectively, is this wise?

Yes. There's no one right answer for what allocation you should use, but a 90/10 split of equities/bonds is a fairly typical recommendation for someone your age.

&gt; If Vanguard doesn't automatically select stocks to choose for me, what exactly should I be purchasing?

I would recommend putting it all into a target date fund, maybe Target Retirement 2060. This fund contains a mixture of four funds: a domestic stock fund, an international stock fund, a domestic bond bond, and an international bond fund. Currently this target date fund is about 90% stocks, but as time goes on and we approach the target year, it will gradually adjust its stock/bond ratio to become more conservative.

A target date fund doesn't really require any effort on your part (beyond putting your money into it), making it a good choice for a beginner. They have a minimum of $1000 at Vanguard, so you have enough to use one. Once you have more money in your account, if you're willing to manage your allocations yourself, then you can switch to using multiple funds with a lower overall fee."
GAULEM,"I'm not a CPA or anything, but technically it sounds to me like your mom is just giving you a gift. If that's the case, then the only tax implication should be that if she gives more than $15k to one of you during the calendar year, then she (not you) will need to file Form 709 (a.k.a. the ""gift tax"" form)."
GAULEM,"&gt; Do I need to report the income(I’m thinking I do off of basic web searching)?

Yes. Income from babysitting is generally considered self-employment income. If you make more than $400 of self-employment income in a calendar year, then you need to report it and pay FICA (social security and medicare) taxes.

&gt; What forms would I have to fill out? 

I think you need to fill out a Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ, and a Schedule SE. I don't have any experience with these particular forms, but I imagine whatever tax software you use will do most of the heavy lifting.

&gt; Would I owe money, as I did not work the rest of the year?

Since this is your only income and it's less than $12k, you don't owe any federal income tax. You probably don't owe any state income tax either. So you should only owe FICA taxes, which I believe will be about $75 for the amount you earned."
GAULEM,"A traditional IRA is probably a bad choice in your situation, since your income is too high to deduct contributions. You're contributing post-tax money, but you'll still need to pay taxes (on the growth) when you withdraw.

I recommend looking into the Backdoor Roth IRA technique instead. But since you have a traditional IRA balance, make absolutely certain that you understand the Pro Rata rule, because that can screw you over if you don't know about it when doing the backdoor technique.

Additionally, it might be worth checking whether the Mega Backdoor Roth technique is available to you. This involves making after-tax contributions to your 401(k) -- since those have a much higher limit then traditional/Roth contributions -- and then rolling them into either your Roth 401(k) or a Roth IRA. A lot of 401(k)s don't allow for this, though."
GAULEM,"&gt; I inputted that I have withdrawn my excess contributions

What excess contributions? It doesn't sound like you made any.

Your actions as I understand them are as follows: you made $5500 of non-deductible traditional IRA contributions. You performed an indirect (60-day) rollover from this account back into the same account. And finally you converted the entire account's balance from traditional to Roth.

If that's the case, you should tell your tax software that you made $5500 of non-deductible traditional IRA contributions. Then enter the 1099-R for the $5500 distribution, and tell the software that the full balance was rolled over into a traditional IRA so it knows it's not taxable. Then enter the 1099-R for the Roth conversion, and make sure that the software understands that $1.92 of it is taxable. (I'm not sure if the order of these three steps actually matters.)"
GAULEM,"Any of those three are fine. If you want to keep things simple, you can just invest in a target date fund.

For example, if you want to stick with Schwab and plan to retire around 2060, then you could invest in the Schwab Target 2060 Index Fund (SWYNX). This type of fund contains a diverse mixture of stocks and bonds, and will gradually rebalance itself toward a less risky allocation as the target year approaches."
GAULEM,"To make the math simple, suppose you're always in the 10% bracket, and have $1000 to spare.

So you make $1000 and put it into a traditional IRA. You retire after 20 years when it's worth $4000, decide to withdraw it all, and end up with $3600 after taxes.

Suppose instead you decided to put that money into a taxable account. You can only afford to put in $900, since the other $100 goes to taxes. After 20 years it would grow to $3600, except you had to pay $270 of it to taxes - and the money you paid to taxes over those 20 years couldn't compound in your favor. So you end up with less than $3300.

In this simple example, using the IRA instead of a taxable account gives you roughly 10% more money after 20 years. In reality, I think it tends to be even more advantageous - because by the time you start withdrawing you probably don't have a job anymore, so you can withdraw much of your IRA money at a lower tax rate than your marginal rate."
GAULEM,"&gt; 2.1% APY is pretty good right?

2.1% is decent for an online savings account, if you want to stick with Discover.

&gt; Are there any banks that have much higher?

You probably won't find anything *much* higher, unless you're willing to deal with extra requirements for meeting the higher rate. I don't know if it's still around, but I recall there was some kind of prepaid debit card that offered 5% APY as long as you kept a small balance, made several purchases per month, etcetera.

You can get something at least a little higher, though. Ally Bank recently upped their rate to 2.2%.

&gt; And does it make sense for me to make a savings account in the first place, or should I wait until I've graduated college and have a job?

I don't see any advantage to waiting. Just remember that you can only make six withdrawals per month from your savings account. (If you withdraw more often than that, they might charge you a fee or close your account.)"
GAULEM,"If you exited the position by Dec 31st and didn't buy more shares within the following 30 days, then overall you're only taxed on the $40k -- unless you created a wash sale by buying shares in an IRA, in which case the deferred loss is gone forever."
GAULEM,"The tax brackets are progressive, so even if you do go over the threshold with your LTCG, only the portion that's actually past the threshold would be taxed at 15%. The first $38k of taxable income would still be federally taxed at 0% if it's all long-term capital gains."
GAULEM,"I don't see why they would; the amount you withhold doesn't affect your employer. And there's no way your employer can really know what number of allowances is correct for you anyway, since they only know about the paychecks you get from them - they don't know whether or not you have other sources of income, whether or not you have any special tax deductions, etcetera."
GAULEM,"A money market fund is not the same as a money market account.

A money market account is a type of bank account. In many cases it's pretty much indistinguishable from a savings account, but I think some offer check-writing and debit cards. As a bank account, it's FDIC insured for the usual amount.

A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that holds low-risk investments such as treasuries. They're ""guaranteed"" to maintain a value of $1 per share so that they won't lose nominal value. I guess that after some money market funds lost value anyway during the housing crash, new regulations were added so that your settlement fund has to specifically be a federal money market fund, since those are lower in risk than other MMFs."
GAULEM,"&gt; Should I contribute all I can toward the 2018 before even starting on 2019?

Yes, might as well. I don't think there's any advantage to putting contributions toward 2019 that you could have instead put toward 2018.

&gt; Will I have to amend my tax returns if I do that?

No. If (and only if) you qualify for the Saver's Credit and had non-zero federal tax liability, then you probably *should* amend your tax return to get the credit. But whether you qualify for the credit or not, you're not technically required to amend it for your direct Roth IRA contributions."
newlifeC13,"&gt; this year we dumped the tax return into medical debt, we haven't got the bonus yet. 

Do not put that bonus into medical debt! You can negotiate that and go on a no-interest payment plan.

newlifeC13,"&gt; your car payment is outrageous, you should look to either trade in and buy outright a cheap used car or lease something less expensive.

newlifeC13,"It's stupid but it probably has to do with salary bands and budget approvals for a new FTE (full-time employee).

Say you're a level 55, making $75K and the salary band is $72K-$89K, you can get a $10K raise and still be a level 55.

If they were trying to promote you to a new level 56 position, which has a salary band of $82K-$99K and that position was not approved in the budget, they cannot promote you. But you can still get a $10K raise to $85K within the approved budget.

Anyway, that doesn't have anything to do with your question, but that's how I could see this happening.  As for your actual question, yes, if you want to seek a more senior level job later, you'll not have shown progression at your existing job.

I'd take the money and look for a new job, or ask when the new position will be funded.

I'm using TurboTax not an accountant, so I want to make sure I do not leave any deductions out that I qualify to use.

2. This goes on Schedule C as self-employment income, yes? Not as ""other income"" on the 1040.

Thanks in advance. 

Edited to add: I do have other self-employment income from other work (not babysitting) and received a 1099 for that. So, I'm already filing a Schedule C and am including my mileage as a business expense deducation for that income.

Also, dispute the late payments on your credit report.

If the garage + Garden will greatly impact your happiness, why wait three years?  If you have never owned a house, you may learn that you don't like doing the maintenance or a lot of yard work.   There are a lot of non-monetary values to consider in these decisions and you are definitely banking pretty good compared to your cost of living already.

&amp;#x200B;

But as others have said,  think about your location, job market, appreciation, etc because from a strictly financial perspective,  it would be better to just wait. "
AtomicLobsters,"Your credit report is intended to reflect your credit worthiness to lenders. Specifically, your ability to pay back money they lend you. Your loans were deferred which meant you weren't paying $XX per month so theoretically you had that available to spend on other things. Now they are not deferred so you are actively making payments on them, which to lenders signals that you are not as strong of a borrower as you were a month ago. 

The score is irrelevant. Relax and stop obsessing over it. It will rise over time as you make consistent payments."
AtomicLobsters,"You should be aiming for:

1. 725+ credit score to get the best rates

2. 6 month emergency fund (6 months of expenses saved)

3. 10%-20% down payment, more is better, this is SEPARATE from the emergency fund.

4. Figure another 6% of sales proce conservatively to cover miscellaneous expenses like escrows, closing costs, insurance, fees and inspections. 

By the time you have reached these goals your credit score will likely be much higher naturally. Don't take on any new credit and try to pay down the balance on your auto loan with the horrible interest rate. "
AtomicLobsters,"If it's really your money get a lawyer. 

But for now she's supporting you and your child financially which is exactly what the IRS considers to be dependents. Your question is one of IRS rules....whether your mother is correct to claim you both as dependents for tax purposes. She is since she can document payments to you that support you and your child. Therefore, she isn't doing anything wrong or illegal. 

If you think that the money or some amount of money that was rightfully yours was taken then you should consult an attorney because that's a separate issue to the tax one. "
AtomicLobsters,"The answer to debt is rarely just shifting the debt around. Chances are if you were irresponsible with credit before you will be again and could dig yourself even deeper. 

It really depends on your credit score whether you can be approved for a small debt consolidation loan like that. In general only the shadiest high interest loans are made to people with maxed out credit cards living paycheck to paycheck. 

Rather than asking about how to conssolidate into one loan you should let us try to help you. Post a list of all your monthly expenses and debts along with their applicable interest rates. Then let us know what your net monthly income is and we can help you develop a budget. $6000 is not much so it can't update be paid off pretty quickly with some prioritization and focus assuming you have a steady income."
AtomicLobsters,"$23k in debt (just realized this is just credit cards, with the cars you have an absurd amount of debt already!) with a wedding and honeymoon you cannot afford quickly approaching and abysmal credit scores and no down payment. 

Sorry you wasted your time typing all that out but there's no way you should be considering this. Pay down your debt, start making better financial decisions (destination weddings are not one, neither is buying new cars). 

Move in together after the wedding and save $700 a month, apply it to debt. Improve credit scores and save money for a down payment. "
AtomicLobsters,IDK but they can send it whenever they want. They will send to collections when they don't believe that there is any chance of getting paid. They'll sell it for $5 or something and then some collections company will harass and damage your credit until they get paid. Why is $40 even worth this potential headache?
AtomicLobsters,Not sure what you're asking then. You had $5000+ in income last year that you paid no taxes on so it's time to pay taxes on that. There's no way to avoid it. If you can't afford it in a lump sum you can set up a payment plan with the IRS. 
AtomicLobsters,"Your credit score is a numerical indication of your quality as a borrower. To a lender someone with limited experience managing credit is a higher risk, therefore your score is lower. It's as simple as that. 

Everyone has to deal with this when they turn 18 or after if they wait to begin establishing credit."
AtomicLobsters,"Dude why are you paying $500+ a month to *rent* a car? Not even that nice of a car....it's a Nissan. 

Don't sign *another* lease locking yourself into this horrible arrangement any longer than you have to. Either purchase the car yo have now at the end of the lease or, better yet, give it back and buy yourself a decent late model vehicle for $8-10k. "
AtomicLobsters,"The equalization of marital property often results in one party writing a check to the other. If the value of her retirement assets exceeded his instead of splitting them they could have worked out ""buy out"" amount. Often times the value of assets are also added up and equalized....so if he kept the 1991 Toyota Corolla and she kept the 2015 BMW 3 series then those are going to result in inequita let distribution. All these inequalities are tallied and a net number is reached that is *owed"" to the other party. This is pretty typical in divorces."
AtomicLobsters,"Don't eat out. Buy cheap groceries. Things that come I'm boxes and bags are usually way over priced and processed anyway. Wait for grocery deals and clip coupons if you can. Grocery stores near me sometimes do BOGO chicken breast packages where you can easily get 6 huge chicken breasts, enough for 12 meals for like $10-12. Beans are good cheap protein. Brown rice, potatoes are always good filling foods. Don't spend money in luxury foodstuff like avocado when it's completely unnecessary. Just use salsa. Learn to buy in bulk too. Buying things in bulk like cases of paper towels and toilet paper and cleaners and other stuff you don't think twice about at the grocery store in Amazon can save you $$$. I buy some food items this way too like big hugs of salsa, cases of Arborio roce for making risotto and other non perishable goods. 

For vegetables, the steamer bags go on sale randomly at my grocery stores. Sometimes as cheap as $1/bag. Each bag is like 2.5 servings but a bag of veggies and half a chicken breast with some rice is a cheap meal. Add hot sauce (generic, super cheap and healthy and no calories) for flavor. 

Fresh veggies are also good but to save money stick to what's in season. Don't pay full price for anything."

geek66,"As is mentioned - If you can pay the whole your credit should not matter.   

However - having been turned down they are required ( in the USA) to give you a copy of the credit report that they based that decision on - if this was a surprise you should look into your overall credit score / situation.

The comment about the price increasing by paying credit - while I am not saying some dealer out there may not be doing something like this, that also is probably illegal, unless the published price has some comment about needing to be financed - and if they DO do that -- look for another dealer.   When buying with cash - IMO - always be willing to walk if you do not get the deal you will be happy with, it is most powerful position to be in.

I would not be surprised if M/C credit is pretty strict since they are commonly damaged, totaled and difficult to RePo.... so the risk to the creditor is very high."
geek66,"You will have more options in the rollover IRA than the 401Ks - typically

As for the future - you can continue with traditional or set up a Roth - that has a number of factors and opinions to consider."
geek66,"So, not to offend - the question really is not what **I** would do.   Risk is a personal choice that you need to make - and my advice in this case is what are your long term goals.  ( When will you retire(I am assuming a ways off since you are in school) , where do you want to be in 5,10, 20 years... etc - any big goals in life?).  

You seem to live frugally - and have reasonable income, though your budget does not balance - but I assume the 2000 in savings per month is really ""what is leftover""?  ( But the #1 one factor in financial health is living within your means - so kudos for being there - you are far better off than I was getting out of college)

Are you looking for a similar rent-free arrangement in Tx?  ' cause that is really a very good set up!

Look into being able to pay down some of your Student loans - if you do this while in school it may not set off the mandatory monthly payments.  ( They are probably at the highest interest rate of any thing you have).

Check you credit score.... I would almost guess it is a little low due to a LACK of activity, so maybe a good rewards CC to get revolving credit and PAY IT MONTHY ( the amount of credit open and available - but unused is a very big factor in the Credit rating)

45K in low interest savings? - general rule of thumb for safety net is 6 months x monthly expenses, in your case that is ONLY like $10K..... and .... I am not one to insist the is in a savings account, as long as you can access the cash in 1-2 Weeks - you can then use a CC for any immediate emergencies.  ( But - many here will insist the safety net be essentially cash - remember my risk statement...) 

&amp;#x200B;

When in doubt - I do like to recommend what I call the rule of thirds... theoretically take your savings and apply 1/3 to the college loans, 1/3 long term savings(but accessible), and 1/3 toward your goals - make a paper budget like this an play it out in different scenarios..... and tune the plan before you do anything.

Also - many couples are not comfortable being totally open with each other about money - if you an you husband have not REALLY discussed all of this, then I would suggest you specifically work on communicating about money and plans.

geek66,"IMO - not really a PF issue, but this is the reality of MOST car purchases, people buy them because they want them, not because they need them or they make financial sense.  So that issue is not just you...however, since you are comfortable living frugally without one - other than the dating issue, it may be worth considering this a litmus test - if your dates think not having a car is wierd, then they may not be for you...unless you just need the back seat.

geek66,"As a sales position - no I doubt you will get any OT, they probably will not even list your hours.  I believe Alaska is a Right to Work state, and most likely your job is referred to as ""Employment at will"".... so there is little to ""rights"" on your side.  If you have a contract, they are only obligated to do what the contact says.

In a job like this the $1,500 just keeps you there, the 6% should be your motivation to work more / smarter / better - etc.... If you find you are doing 50-60 hours and NOT generating sales to build commission worthy of the time... then it's time to move on.

However - in the travel / hospitality business, it is conceivable that they may want or require you to be there specific hours.  If these hours are not periods where you can work towards sales that you earn commission for - then also a problem, time to move on.

geek66,"The big difference is pre-tax (tax deferred) vs after-tax and your expected tax liabilities in retirement.  If you believe ( as many do ) taxes will be significantly higher in 20 30 40 years - so getting into an after-tax - and no tax on disbursements will be better than letting it grow pre-tax, and paying taxes then, when in theory, you will have less income and be paying a lower tax rate. 

There is no hard and fast rule - or formula to apply - to determine which is better - but there are a lot of calculators that could look at hypothetical's and show the differences."
geek66,"All sounds (quite)  good - I would set up a brokerage account (move and manage the S&amp;P500 (fund?) to there ) and possibly an IRA - ideally with the same company you have the 401s with so you can mange all in on place... I do like Fidelity - but Vanguard also has a lot of fans here.  - Although many of them now let you ""see"" accounts at other brokerages.

In your 401K - reading again - you have $250 K in there?   Clearly in reading again it is not $250....  

Keep in mind - or a good reality check, is the 72 Investment rule - your investment will double in approximately 72 / your % rate or return.   So --   the S&amp;P has \~ 10% average return over it's life - even very conservatively expecting a 6% return means you money will double in 72/6 or \~12 years.

So - set to some specific goals, look at their costs, and plan, execute, review on a regular 6 month or so basis...and adjust.

geek66,"Other than making the biggest payment at the lowest rate...conceivable a HELOC could have a lower rate than a 1st Mortgage, but the mortgage rates have been so low for so long this is not really likely.   Example in 1990 it the rate was 10%... but that is over 30 years ago...

&amp;#x200B;

Still someone could have taken a ""bad"" mortgage - I hear the mobile home market is rife with this issue, but there is not really any residual value here to do that ether.

geek66,"IMO - managing (checking in) 1 or 2 x a year to check on performance may offset this.   You can add some other fund - but being sensitive to the low expense ratio is valuable.

Fidelity's tools are pretty good  - you can probably find a calculator to show the impact over 20 or 30 years...."
serialopportunist,To answer... if it’s your first time filing then no you can’t access your cra account because the system can’t verify you yet. Yes you have to mail in your first return and wait until you get your notice of assessment. Then you can set up your account online.
serialopportunist,Money laundering? That’s what it sounds like to me but perhaps others have a different take. I would stay away from this deal. You don’t want to have tax or worse thinking you are accessories to this scheme if it ever goes down!
serialopportunist,"I am obviously of an older generation and as the parent of a teen soon to be on his own I totally can appreciate why a young person would want to stay at home for comfort and savings. But there are lessons learned during the struggle to make it on your own that are so important. You learn what you are made of and how to cope with adversity.

Also, I do think parents need to move on from their roles too. 

This is such a personal call, I’m sure it’s different for everyone."
serialopportunist,Then it would be a 2 part for taxes. The appreciation between the time of purchase and her filing change of use would be exempt from tax. The appreciation from then onwards to the sale of the property will be subject to capital gains in 50 percent of the appreciation. If she has any capital losses she could put those against the gains. 
serialopportunist,"This is highly suspicious. I was an auditor for CRA in the past, and we wouldn’t do initial contact this way. Initial contact is usually a request for your business records. And once those are reviewed then we would make a proposal for Reassessment. 

Contact CRA immediately. Do not give any information to whoever is calling you.  The CRA agent will be able to enquire if there is a review or active audit. There is always a paper trail!"
serialopportunist,"Also if you want to rent it out later make sure that it is not something where you have to have the hotel manage and rent it for you. The fees are steep, abt 55 percent here in Canada), and sometimes there are restrictions of how much or how long you can “live” there. It would be harder to sell in the future as well. "
serialopportunist,"Why would they be risky? According to the video the person didn’t pay their property taxes and it was foreclosed because of that. I’m operating under the assumption that you are still paying what you need to as a homeowner. This risk isn’t part of the reverse mortgage itself. If you had a regular mortgage and didn’t pay your taxes you would also be foreclosed on.

I think that used properly it my be a viable option, but most won’t consider them because they charge higher interest and may leave nothing in the owner’s estate to leave for inheritance. I am not for or against the product, just research and see if it makes sense for you."
serialopportunist,"Depends on your expenses in retirement. We have had periods over the last 10 years where we have “retired” and I would say we were having a really good life including travel etc averaging $3k/month. No scrimping but a paid for house, no need for fancy clothes and preferring to cook at home helped. Also- we are in Canada and therefore don’t have huge monthly healthcare costs... so ymmv."
serialopportunist,Then I’m afraid there is no way to get around the capital gains on the rental. How long has it been since she lived in the property? Did she file a change in use when she started to rent it?
serialopportunist,"Ok and what city are you looking to move to? Generally you will need to find a job in order to qualify for an  apartment, you’re right that a bigger centre will have more opportunities but there is also higher cost. The good part is there are usually more services to help low income in the city as well. Start by contacting some of those agencies and see if they have housing they ca point you to."
serialopportunist,"Since you said RRSP op, I assume you are in Canada. Federal government or provincial? I spent my career in federal and the answer is salary scales are unionized and non negotiable. I did work shortly for provincial, and there was a little more leeway for where you qualified on the salary band based on education, experience etc. 

Worth it? Only you can answer, but know that government in any form is very different than private sector and because of the unions, pay for performance is not allowed. Government is more secure once you are in though. "
serialopportunist,"My take is that either way you will turn 32. Either you will be 32 with a degree and a career with good prospects or you will be 32 in the same situation as you are now. 

So take that chance, don’t let the age thing bother you. It’s never too late."
serialopportunist,You might want to look at a reverse mortgage if they are available where you are. It would let your parents continue to live in the house and the amount would be paid back once they sell or pass on. They can be expensive but it is a way for folks that are house rich and cash poor access some money to get them through their older years.
thisismy2ndaccting,"Interesting. I can’t think of too many personal emergencies that can’t wait two days for a trade to settle...and most of those will fit on a credit card to float until the money comes in.  That’s when the ridiculous limits on credit cards come in handy.

Bail, maybe?  "
thisismy2ndaccting,"&gt; it's easy to find yourself paralyzed by a neverending cycle of ""planning"" and ""playing it safe"".

I think you’re conflating humanity’s decision making process and predilection to analysis paralysis with reasonable personal finance.

&gt; I think it's easy to fall into a sort of purgatory, when sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith? Or maybe not even a ""leap of faith"", so much as make sure you have some sort of para-glider and you're prepared to make your choice work.

Continuous improvement processes eventually get to a point where the next few percentage points are just too difficult to achieve. The reward isn’t worth the effort. /r/PF’s budget scrubs help people determine that point for themselves. Most people are pretty down on big data plans for cell phones. Personally, it’s the only internet I have. I don’t have WiFi at home, and I don’t go into town regularly to use the WiFi there.  But for someone else who lives less rurally than I do, that’s probably an easy win for them.  Ditto grocery budget. Mines probably a bit higher than usual for two adults and three pets, but we eat out very rarely. If I don’t need a $200 restaurant budget, why can’t I dump some of that money into better ingredients for home cooked meals?  On the other hand, we’ve seen people spending $1000 a month on groceries and $400 on eating out...that’s a pretty big chunk of change. 

I can’t agree that planning isn’t feasible. Lots of people graduate with some horrendous student loans. Some would do so no matter what their financial education looks like. But some college students would think twice about a second round at the bar if they realized that every dollar of their loan money they spent needed to be paid back 1.8 times over (6.8% loan for 20 years. If you borrowed $20k, you’ll pay back $36,640).  If that fifteen dollar pitcher of beer is really $27 in repayment...do you want it that much?  If you do, fine, chase that dream!  Make it work. Just know what it’ll really cost you. 

Right now, I’m teetering on the edge of a ridiculous lifestyle purchase. It’s relatively expensive, but will offer hours of recreation and entertainment. For privacy’s sake, let’s call it a Tesla X. (It’s not really) I’m about to drop high five figures on a vehicle, when I have one that does the job well. I mostly have the cash for this purchase, but will probably have to take out a loan for part of the purchase. We’ll use it several times a month, and honestly, probably use it to make some money and offset the cost of ownership. It fulfills a lot of life goals and is something I’ve been planning to do for years.  I can make the money work. I’ve got some bonds to cash in and a brokerage account to tap and I’ll hold my breath until some other obligations are over, but in five years?  I’ll be ecstatic I jumped at this opportunity when I did.  And college me will be so proud of grown up me for accomplishing the “big goal” we set fifteen years ago. 

On the other hand, I can do this BECAUSE I planned and was smart with my money for the last twenty years. I’ve saved my pennies and told myself no and weighed my purchases and vacations and splurges.  I’ve curated a behavior style that mostly makes my own coffee, drinks interesting beers by the six pack from the liquor store, cooks a mean fillet, and buys most of my clothes at the thrift store.  I picked a college that offered me a full scholarship. I bought a house I can comfortably afford, a car that I’ll happily drive into the ground, and married someone who shares those values.  That’s giving me the ability to metaphorically stumble into a Tesla store this morning and say, “I like the red one, gimme a quote.”

So no. Not every decision is fully optimized. But the balance of your actions effects the balance of your bank account.

I’d hold off on the new car until your credit cards are paid off, your wedding fund is established, and you’ve got $5k to put down on your new vehicle. It also gives you time to shop around and see what you want, as well as build up cash for the move. "
thisismy2ndaccting,"First, Max out your employer benefit. 

Second, shop around for a physical insurance agency. Most brokers will have dozens of companies that issue policies that they sell. The broker knows the underwriting standards for the various companies and may be able to provide viable options, or tell you when you’re likely to qualify for term insurance again. 

A distant third is to discuss whole life policies with a financial planner.  Yes, they’re expensive. But sometimes it’s all you’ve got available.

thisismy2ndaccting,"If you can’t tell if it’s worth it, they didn’t explain it well enough.  Call them up, ask for a better explaination. 

Given your age and income, you’re more likely than most to end up in a position to have to plan for estate taxes. Currently, $11 million is excluded from your estate. The amount above that is taxed at a high rate. The life insurance policy is meant to circumvent the estate tax as it passes outside of probate, and if set up correctly, outside of your estate. 

If you took the $14400 annually and invested it for 60 years at 7% and left it to your beneficiary, you’d pay in $864,000 and end up with almost $13.5 million...and you’ve busted the estate tax exemption in a single account, and paid taxes on dividends every year from now until then.

Life insurance for the vast majority of people is for income replacement. For a very small sliver, it’s for wealth transfer.  You’re part of the sliver. 

Also, come over to /r/fatfire"
thisismy2ndaccting,"Compound growth will be an easier concept to teach for investments. 

Compound interest is better illustrated through student loans. Public service loan forgiveness repayment plans and income based repayment, can definitely be set low enough to not cover the interest on a student loan. The debt grows over time to be even more than it was when you graduated. The trick is to do the paperwork correctly and stick it out for the full ten years for PSLF and for the full 20 for IBR. IBR also comes with the tax bomb. "
thisismy2ndaccting,"The money is mostly in bonds, which makes sense given the fiduciary responsibility of the firm to not make risky investments with the money. Grandma may have set the investments when the trust was established and didn’t want them changed. Bond funds have been sucking for a while since interest rates are rising.  "
thisismy2ndaccting,"Yes. It’s not how much you spend, it’s how much you can keep. If your annual expenses are low, and your savings rate high, you can attain 25 times your annual expenses quickly, and thus be financially independent. 

You’ll need to save and invest between 55% and 65% of your income.

You can also use it to lessen the tax burden for investments, depending on how it’s invested and what the endstate is. In 30 years, you could do a transfer of the policy into an annuity that will spit out an income stream.  When you do that, the income is taxed, but hopefully it’s not taxed as hard as it is right now.  

Another benefit of the VUL is that you can rebalance the account without having to realize the gain in assets. If you buy a share of XYZ Fund at $100, and it goes to $200, you can sell that share of the fund inside the insurance policy and not pay capital gains on the $100. Instead, you keep all $200 and buy another fund.  

The kicker on life insurance policies is in the details. 

Questions to ask and understand:
What are the fees?  How much does that drag on your gains?  What happens if I decide this isn’t working for me in two years? Five? Ten? Thirty?  How much do i get back out in cash, or what are my options to change it to something more fitting?  What kinds of life changes should trigger a relook at this financial choice?  What’s the worst that could happen?  What’s the best?  What happens if I do nothing and just invest this money this year?  Next year?  When I die?  If I do die, who will talk to my beneficiary about next steps?  What would be the best solution if my beneficiary is in college?  Newly married and buying a house? Retiring in five years? Retired?  

These are complicated products.  I’m not a huge fan unless I can get a client to understand what we’re doing, why, what happens if we don’t, and what are the second and third order effects for both scenarios, best case and worst case.  Ideally, they hear me out and think about it for a bit, gnaw on the problem, and come back with questions before the decision is made because these are usually painful to get out of in the early years. 

Edit:

Also, look at what you’re getting for the percentage of investments. It better not just be picking funds!  The insurance is a good example of this firm understanding your desires and needs and meeting them. They should also offer tax planning, perhaps a CPA on staff for returns.  As your business grows, they might provide 401k options or other profit sharing methods for employees. If you need any Professional services for any reason I bet they have a Rolodex of vetted partners that other clients have been very happy with.  Estate planning, charitable giving...checking their website, they also offer business planning.  As your business grows, buy-sell agreements, key person deals and retention, and someone to bounce ideas off of may very well be worth the1%/ $1000 a year fee. 

If the website is a pile of hooey, though, kick ‘em to the curb and find a new firm that does do what you want them to."
thisismy2ndaccting,"I just figured out an analogy!

You just got invited to a wedding and you’re RSVPing. The RSVP asks for your meal preference and you want to have the poached chicken. However, you’re terribly allergic to dairy, and there’s nowhere on the card to note that. Instead, there’s an email address for the caterer. Mail your RSVP back for the wedding and indicate chicken AND email the caterer to tell them you’re allergic to dairy so they know that your plate of chicken needs to be dairy free."
thisismy2ndaccting,"I used to do this for a bank and agree with /u/jcl1003    

Chase has decent rewards cards depending on your spending, and your account balances may qualify you for a higher tier account.  It won’t cost you anything, but you get better benefits. Plus? You now have a human being to call if your debit card or credit card is compromised or if you need something from the bank, rather than the customer service line. "
HorizontalBob,I've bought new cars for cheaper than some of my used cars. Cars are just an expense. I could only have two sets of clothes and live with my extended family but I decided the expense was worth it to not live that way. 
HorizontalBob,"Storage insurance is fine for a car you own. Plenty of places offer that. Your loan agreement most likely requires you to have full coverage. That's the issue. Unless your loan company allows it or you pay off the loan either cash or with an unsecured loan, you're violating your loan agreement. "
HorizontalBob,"While I'm not saying it can't happen, you have to remember that there's the lender and the lendee. The lender does not want their loan to be worthless. China and Japan don't want to be paid off with a few gold bars. "
HorizontalBob,"Does the pension have survivor or spousal benefits? Is there anyone to collect them? Besides the obvious short term and long term lifespans, you'll want to look at the possibility of a retirement home, assisted living, etc later in his life.

I'd lean towards the monthly payments."
HorizontalBob,"If you haven't trashed your credit and are not paying, why would they settle for less? If they want, they can also take you to court and garnish your wages for the whole amount, sell it to someone, who will or at the very least harass you. "
HorizontalBob,"Assuming the vehicle is a need, it is a depreciating asset and there's a certain point where it becomes a luxury item. It's like you can eat beans for protein. You also have the choice of hamburger and steak. What do you do? You can eat beans now to afford more steak in the future. Are you sick of beans? Are you buying steak on a hamburger budget? You get the idea."
HorizontalBob,"Annual credit report.com to get all three credit reports.

Contact each company listed and explain the situation and ask what is required to regain access. List all companies, cards, limits, amount owed, interest rates.

Depending on that and his budget, it's pay the minimum on everything then put extra towards either highest interest or lowest amount owed.

While debt never goes away, it does fall off the credit reports and most states have a statute of limitations on suing you for it. "
HorizontalBob,"Get the loan payoff quote.

See if any motorcycle dealership will give you a straight quote to buy it. 

Get pre-approved for a car loan through the credit union. Explain what you're doing. 

Depending on what you owe on the bike vs selling price, you could try to sell private party. If the payoff was low enough, the credit union might get you a personal loan so you could payoff the bike before you sell it.  The issue is always taking it two loans near the same time. 


"
HorizontalBob,"Lol, I find it funny everyone recommending lifestyle creep. What are you looking at for a vehicle?  35k is fine, but remember cars are a depreciating asset. 

35k in a savings account is slightly losing to inflation. Inflation is actually good for debt with a fixed interest rate. Still look at your emergency fund as months of monthly bills. I'd probably pay off half the vehicle so your upside on the loan, but I like being liquid. 



"
HorizontalBob,"Note just talking fed rates.

Your 5k is taxed right now at 24% and you won't pay taxes on it or its earnings.

The company match's 5k is pre-tax. You will pay taxes on everything when you withdraw. Now the guessing part. If you withdraw this slowly, it and probably Social Security will be in the low brackets. What's that tax rate? 12%? 15%? 20%?"
_myusername__,"If your parents are willing and able to help you, I would encourage accepting their help. The 6k in your 401k would be penalized and taxed if you take it out this early, and it would also set your retirement quite a bit back

The best course of action would be to find a job asap, whether it be one in your profession or a placeholder job until you find one you really like. "
_myusername__,"People don’t invest based solely on dividends. I’d say they’re just an added perk. And the “small amount” quickly adds up when you start owning hundreds of shares - typically people reinvest these dividends which equates to free shares

_myusername__,"Moving it to a new 401k or IRA wouldn't do anything to help your current situation.

_myusername__,"The thing is you net $2600 a month. If you subtract $1200 for rent, utilities and food, you have $1400/month to put towards your debt.

"
_myusername__,"That’s not a valid concern, you have to face your problems head on. Everybody makes mistakes - you just have to own up to it. If you keep neglecting it it’s just going to get worse. 

Bankruptcy will destroy your credit and you will get no loans for at least 10 years. ~12k of debt on your salary is absolutely doable, and you’ll feel amazing after paying it off. 

1-2 years of being frugal is better than 3 months of paperwork and 10 years of this hanging over your head"
_myusername__,"Okay, I would still open a Roth IRA. The reason I ask is because for an IRA, you’re only allowed to annually contribute up to a max of $6000 or your salary, whichever is lower. 

So if you make $5000 total from your internship, you can only contribute $5000 this year. If you make $6500 over the summer, you can only contribute $6000

Roth IRA is good because your gains are not taxed. Downside is that it’s for retirement, so you can’t touch it until age 59.5 (with a few exceptions)

Do a little bit of reading on IRAs and 401Ks in your spare time. Really valuable knowledge to have and it’ll put you miles ahead of your peers when it comes to retirement "

If you’re self employed I believe you have to pay taxes quarterly, but I’m not sure here.

Either way, the most return you can get safely by doing this is probably 3% from a cd, but since you’re not putting all the money into a CD at the beginning of the year, you’re talking about very little interest that doesn’t make the headache worth it. 

I wouldn’t recommend investing your tax money into anything more high risk than a CD "
_myusername__,"Do you need the money anytime soon? Do you own a home? 

If you don’t need the money and you own a house already, I’d just put them across a few ETFs (assuming you have an emergency fund already). 

It’s true that time in the market is better than timing the market, but with that much money, I’d personally feel a bit more at ease investing maybe 15-20% at a time, at least until the market stabilizes

_myusername__,"Bruh, you’re gambling with your life right now. You’re talking about future raises, future promotions, possible overtime, stock grants that might come... And once again, you’ve got zero retirement, zero emergency fund

You’re talking about talking down a 20k car to 15k - idk where the hell you think that deal is coming from but already that’s a reach

You think you’re gonna have $200 monthly payments. Even if that were true with ZERO interest on a 15k car, that’s 75 monthly payments. You really want to spend more than 6 years paying for a car that is already 9 years old??

What if god forbid you got sick? Or you got laid off? Or into an accident? Or need emergency repairs on the car done? 

I think you’re being WAYYY too optimistic and generous with your career/pay expectations. What if you don’t get OT or don’t get that promotion? What if your startup tanks and your stocks go to shit? 

Do you like living life on the edge or something?"
_myusername__,"I was thinking that too at first, but after more thought, your money actually makes the most impact on the ~~non-interest~~ non-Amex card

Let’s say you pay $750 on the Amex the first month. Even if you balance transfer another $750 to the Amex, the $750 in theory (idk how interest accumulation is actually calculated) would have already accumulated interest before you transferred it. Whereas if you paid the $750 on the non-Amex card, the $750 on Amex accumulates no interest 

Big picture wise though, we’re talking about like maybe $4/month in interest if you didn’t even have the Amex. So whatever you choose to do isn’t a big deal, as long as you pay it down asap

For example, let’s say I forgot to report my $4,000 ST loss for 2018, could I still use it for 2019? Or does it HAVE to be used the year the loss was realized and only if there’s leftover does it carry over"

billthecatt,"&gt; My tax guy said I am not meant to put more into an HSA than I expect to spend in the year. I had not heard that previously.

That would be for an FSA not an HSA.

&gt; My employer and I both contribute to my HSA. I have it set so that my contributions do not go over the maximum amount.

Family max is $6,700.  As long as you were covered by an eligible plan for the entire 12 months.

Sounds like your tax guy may have made a mistake based on the limited information here."
billthecatt,"&gt; Just deposit in a savings account? My plan does allow for in-service withdrawals but since I was not allowed to make after-tax contributions, that money shouldn't technically exist for me to roll over to a Roth IRA.

Yes, that money does not count as after-tax contributions that could be rolled into a Roth IRA, it's just normal income."
billthecatt,"It depends on many things, here are some to consider:

For instance:

- Are you young?  (Might your incomes be on a good path towards increasing, making a larger mortgage more affordable?)

- Do you have / plan to have children?  (Children are not cheap.  Would one of you stay home, etc?)

- Interest rates were higher when that book was written, I believe, so the monthly cost of that mortgage was probably higher than it would be today.  (I do not know if the revisions of the book account for that).

- Do you have other debt or cash flow concerns?

Overall, a better gauge would be % of income towards your monthly payments.  A conservative metric would be 20%.  From a personal perspective, having a low mortgage payment (ours was about 13% of gross income when we bought the house), has life much more enjoyable as we've never stressed about the mortgage, and have been able to build up savings, enjoy more vacations, etc."

&gt; Q.  Only one spouse owns an HSA and a qualified HSA medical plan. Can the money in the HSA be used for either spouse (even the spouse who is not covered by the HSA medical plan) as long as the money is used for approved medical expenses?
A.  At least one family member must own an approved HSA medical insurance plan in order to own a Health Savings Account. But, once a health savings account has been established, funds from the account can be used for eligible expenses for any family member.

3) No.  If you take a distribution, you cannot re-contribute that amount.

HCRP is definitely not an FSA.  It's its own plan, but typically employers use HRAs these days instead of HCRPs.  "
billthecatt,"At $500k each:

&gt; The only visible marriage penalty tax from the chart comes in the form of two individuals making over $500,000 a year. In this case, the marriage penalty tax is 2% X $400,000 = $8,000, which is not much for a $1,000,000+ income family, especially since the past married income threshold was only $470,701+ at a 2.6% higher income rate. So compared to the old tax rule, it’s still a win.

For it to be a $70k penalty, you'd have to be making about $4.1M total."

Yes

&gt;  but on the downside, it is all in one account (all eggs in one basket?!)

Not really.  The basket/eggs are your investments themselves, the institution you are using is just an intermediary.  You can still be just as diversified"
billthecatt,"&gt; Like employer matching. Suppose my employer matches 5% of a paycheck if I also contribute this 5%. Therefore if I save aggressively and done in 3 months (6 contributions), then there is only 5%*$3846*6=$1153.85 compared to 5%*$3846*26=$5000 if I pay evenly for the whole year.

This will vary by employer.  Some will do a true-up at the end of the year to ensure you get the entire 5%.  Some will not.

Check with your employer.

Yes, to increase time in the market like you noted at the beginning of your post."

UN: [my name], right?

UN: this is Chase bank calling, and at the start of the new year, we just want to make sure that we are meeting your needs-

Feeling weird, I checked the time (6:30pm), which was an hour later than the caller's area, and decided to hang up.

blablahblah,"The amount of money you're paying towards your mortgage balance (principal and interest) did not change. But you're not just paying them for the mortgage. You're also paying your property taxes and homeowner's insurance through them. If your property taxes are higher than expected (or go up), or if your insurance rates increase, they'll need to increase your total payment to cover those. If the increase is because of your insurance costs, shop around for cheaper insurance. If the increase is because of your property taxes, the only thing you can do is lobby to lower property taxes."
blablahblah,"Then the mix seems fine to me. Roth vs traditional at this point in your life is essentially a gamble whether your taxes will be higher in retirement than they are now.

You should check a retirement calculator though, because saving just 10% of your income may not be enough to retire securely."
blablahblah,"&gt; I also don't know if never having been officially employed has any effect on their decision.

Yeah, they're not going to give you a credit card if they don't think you'll be able to pay it back, regardless of what the mail offer says. That's your biggest problem. "
blablahblah,"You haven't hit your deductible yet, so right now, Cigna is paying nothing (the ""discount"" is just a game they play where the doctors inflate their prices so Cigna can claim they gave you a huge benefit). Once you hit your deductible, Cigna will pay a chunk of the bill on any future medical bills. 

You're not going to convince Cigna to cover this because the terms of your plan say they don't have to. In the future, you can try switching to a plan with a lower deductible, but those tend to be much more expensive. You're probably better off just making sure your emergency fund is large enough to cover this amount."
blablahblah,"There's lots of different FICO scores too, unfortunately. I believe Bank of America and Discover will both show you your FICO 8 score, but many mortgage lenders are still using older FICO models, which is also different from the FICO Auto scores used to get car loans and the FICO Bankcard scores used for credit cards. "
blablahblah,"You fill out and mail them a form1040 which tells the government how much you made, how much was taxed, and all the adjustments you're claiming to your gross income and taxes owed.

If you contribute money to a traditional IRA, you to subtract that money from your gross income, which reduces the amount of taxes you owe for the year. If you contribute to a Roth IRA, you don't get to subtract that money so you still owe the taxes on it.

You then compare the amount of taxes your employer withheld and the amount you've already sent in (if you paid estimated taxes) to the amount the 1040 says you should owe. If you paid more than that amount, you get a refund. If you paid less, you have to send the IRS more money.

The number on the tax return is the only number that matters for how much you pay this year. Everything else was just an estimate."
blablahblah,"Citi Double Cash has a 3% foreign transaction fee. The Citi Costco card does not, and has good rewards for travel and dining. The biggest annoyance I've had with it is that the cash back is in the form of a coupon you take to Costco, and if you don't spend that much in  one transaction they hand you actual cash back for the rest.

Other no-fee cards with decent rewards and no foreign transaction fee are the Chase Amazon card (especially if you have Prime and spend a lot on Amazon or at Whole Foods) and the Capital One Quicksilver."
blablahblah,"If you have more than 18 months salary for the down payment, your situation is a bit abnormal so the ""typical"" advice may not apply to you exactly. As other people have mentioned, try to figure out what your monthly payments would be (and remember that you'll need to pay insurance and property taxes too) and make sure you can afford *that*. The 3x salary is just a ballpark estimate for what you can afford given a typical down payment, taxes, and insurance costs."
blablahblah,"If you pay down your (relatively low interest) student loans and then have an emergency with no money in the bank, you'll have to pay for the emergency with (high interest) credit cards and you'll just be even deeper in the hole than you are now. You shouldn't necessarily put all of that money in an emergency fund, but you should make sure you have enough to cover a small medical issue or car repairs or sudden unemployment right before rent is due before you start tackling your relatively safe student loans. "
blablahblah,"Sort of. Because tax brackets are progressive (the more money you make, the higher the rate) and because of deductions, it's hard to say exactly how much you owe in taxes each quarter. Usually, you'd estimate how much in taxes you'd owe for the whole year based on how much you've made so far and divide that by four."
blablahblah,"The credit cards have what, like a 20% interest rate. There is no investment in the world that will reliably give them more than 20% annual returns which means that paying off the credit cards is a better investment than anything else they could make."
blablahblah,"They don't get the principle you already paid. If the house sells at the foreclosure auction for more than the mortgage balance plus fees, they have to cut you a check for the difference. 

Foreclosures have basically no upside for the bank- they'd really rather not do it- so if they are willing to give you a crazy high mortgage, it's because they think they'll be able to get you to pay, even if the payments are way more than the recommended percent of your income."
blablahblah,"Go to your bank's website. There's a button somewhere labeled ""statements"". If you click on that, you will see a PDF that gets generated each month. That will have three dates on it: the statement open date, the statement close date, and the payment due date. It will also have an amount on it, which is the balance you owed on the statement close date.

The due date is typically 25 days after the statement closed, which is why I rounded to the 25th for your statement close date. If on the statement close date (the 25th), your balance is $0, a statement will be generated saying you owe $0, and that's what they expect you to pay on the 20th of the following month.

This all goes back to the days when they needed to mail you a bill every month and then you needed to mail them a check to pay it which is why there's 25 days between when they snapshot what you owe and when they expect you to pay it."

blablahblah,"The problem isn't that you never get your money back. It's that it'll take some time to get some money back.

The main advantage is the free checked bag, so make sure you're getting more out of that benefit than the card's annual fee. 

Unless you have a specific feature in mind, like no foreign transaction fee or airport lounge benefits or something, your simplest option is just to get a 2% cash back card like the Citi Double Cash. "
blablahblah,"I suppose the alternative would be to divide the loan into fixed principal payments (plus interest) instead of having fixed monthly payments. So you'd be making really large payments at the beginning of the loan and really small payments at the end. 

You would end up paying less in interest over the life of the loan this way, but if you can afford the much larger payments at the start of the loan, you can just make extra payments to the principal on a normal loan. "
blablahblah,"1. The size of the bank isn't a factor in your credit score. As long as they report things to the credit agencies, it counts the same as any other card.

2. Your parents credit score doesn't reflect on you, but all activity on the account does. If they continue to do things on that account that hurt their credit score (carry high balances, miss payments, etc.), it could hurt your score. If you're an authorized user, the whole account is on your credit report, not just purchases made with your card.

3. Unless there's some law in Canada that says otherwise, yes."
blablahblah,"The quarterly payments are just estimates. You can just go to the [IRS website](https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay) and pay them online, no paperwork required. (I'm not sure how IL handles state taxes, you'll have to figure that out separately)

 When you fill out your tax return next year, you'll file a Schedule C where you report how much you made and how much you spent making it. That'll get factored into calculating how much tax you actually owe. If you overestimated on your monthly payments, the IRS will send you a refund. If you underestimated, you'll have to send them the difference."
blablahblah,"Credit utilization is a snapshot-in-time thing, not an ongoing measurement. Your credit card company reports your utilization to the credit agencies once a month when the statement is generated.

That number has a pretty big impact on your score, but it doesn't really have a memory. If you pay off your credit card bill right before the statement is generated next month, your utilization will be reported as 0% and your score will shoot right back up.

Your credit score only really matters when you're applying for something that checks your credit, so just make sure you keep your utilization low the month before that and you're fine regardless of how it swings in the meantime.  "
blablahblah,"When you have a mortgage at 4% or student loans at 6%, you can afford to play the long game and pay it off at a slow rate. At 26%, you're being charged nearly $100/mo for not paying off that credit card bill. The faster you pay it off, the less money you waste on interest."
blablahblah,"As long as you can pay off your bill in full every month and there's no extra fee for paying with a credit card, it would be almost stupid not to use the credit card. You don't pay any fees or interest, you get whatever rewards your credit card offers, and if the company gets hacked, you don't have to worry about the hackers draining your bank account.

If you're going to carry a balance though, the interest charges will wipe away all the benefits and then some."
blablahblah,"Start looking for new jobs now and tell them you want a start date of April 1st or later. It's going to take at least a few weeks to schedule an interview, get an offer, and negotiate. Use any accrued PTO time for interviews, if you have to. 

No one who extends a job offer is going to expect you to start the next day, because it's so common for people to give at least 2 weeks notice before they leave an old job. If they do expect you to quit immediately and start the next day, they're probably not a good employer."
blablahblah,"Do you have a plan for paying off the debt, or are you just trying to juggle it as long as possible before you start getting consumed by the interest? If you do, when will your plan allow you to pay off the debt?"
EuropeanInTexas,"No 

&amp;#x200B;

 

&gt;You must make a special computation to figure the maximum amount of elective deferrals and nonelective contributions you can make for yourself. When figuring the contribution, compensation is your “earned income,” which is defined as net earnings from self-employment after deducting both:  
&gt;  
&gt;one-half of your self-employment tax, and  
&gt;  
&gt;contributions for yourself.

EuropeanInTexas,"If the company has a rule that limits you to 30% of your gross pay the only way to reach the 19k is to make \~63k/year

But if you manage to get even close to 19k on a 60k salary you are already WAY ahead of the curve."
EuropeanInTexas,"That depends, there are a couple of different types of ""Corporate"" cards, there are corporate liability and shared liability.  


If they are 100% corporate liability then it doesn't affect your credit score at all, but if they are shared liability cards then it will."
EuropeanInTexas,"Some companies will forbid you for taking a ""similar"" position somewhere else due to fears of split loyalties or that it will affect your work performance if you moonlight all night somewhere else -  but other than such company specific restrictions, there is nothing stopping you."

For long term savings / investments CD's are subpar and you'd be better off picking something with a higher yield.

BananasonThebrain,"&gt;IRA

Just curious - have you started the IRA somewhere? Even if you just put in $50/month while you are focusing on paying down debt it can help set up the habit of doing this. And it helps get over the mental hurdle of ""I have to open an IRA one day"". "
BananasonThebrain,"I found this while looking and buying a house. It was tremendously helpful in combining 'personal' with 'financial' and helped me view a home purchase differently that I would have. It is not a normal purchase, it is hardly an investment, everyone needs to live somewhere, there is a lot of flexibility in how much someone thinks they can afford, etc. These views worked for me - let me think about this purchase holistically. It helps of course that I have a decent salary and live in a lower cost of living area.   


After the home purchase I stayed around and have learned so much about how to make my money work for me. I keep increasing my contributions to tax-advantaged plans (well beyond the match) and keep a tight budget on YNAB that still allows to build up some fun pools of money. I figured out with my partner that he benefits from a 'fun allowance' and that I benefit from having him happy and constrained, rather than tempted to judge every purchase. I'm absolutely certain that the mindsets I learned here have allowed me to have more money and investments, to be happier with financial choices, and to be more at peace in my relationships, than I otherwise would have. So THANKS. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so grateful for the advice people give, the diversity of experiences they allow, and also for those ""pull out the popcorn"" moments this sub generates. "
BananasonThebrain,"I know this isn't what you are asking or want to hear, but do you need that bike? 

A 7-year, 11% interest rate car loan of that magnitude is VERY high. Are there any ways to increase your income a tad (e.g., by selling items or working extra hours, or taking on a saturday job), to reduce those interest payments?"
BananasonThebrain,"Congrats on getting rid of the credit card debt! I would tend to think you can be more aggressive in paying off those SoFi debts, but don't know how much your rent and lifestyle cost you. Aggressive here means: really making some sacrifices in lifestyle to pay them down (e.g., not going out to restaurants, bringing lunch to work, holding off on vacations and spur of the moment weekend trips). If your job is stable having a slightly lower emergency fund may be okay. I trust you are still paying monthly payments on both SoFi and student loan while building up the emergency fund? "
BananasonThebrain,"OP I hadn't heard of the rule of 72 - it's basically that by starting early you can really take advantage of compound interest. If you assume a 4% interest rate (beyond inflation), your money will double every 18 years (72/4=18). So by starting at 17, what money you save now will triple by the time you retire. 

But, beware that you are also in a period to really increase your education so your future jobs pay much more than you make now, so don't only prioritize savings over education. (i.e., working less may pay off more than the savings you are losing). It's good to approach your situation with a good sense of balance. "
BananasonThebrain,I agree- dude your mental calm when having no loans will be extraordinary. You can do that and still have a lot left over. Do that and then treat getting a job like a job (ie do it 40 hrs per week). 
BananasonThebrain,I would put a chunk of that into lower risk products like an index fund. Any answer to the questions you pose must depend on the rest of your financial picture and your goals and vision for where you want to be in the future? What do you prioritize? Stability? Education? A house? 
BananasonThebrain,Honestly not taking that match is crazy - it's the most free money possible to get. Please encourage her to take at least that. Is she working full time and contributing to social security? Help her get her annual report from social security and look at how that expected salary compares to her lifestyle and budget. 
BananasonThebrain,"Ring-300 seems like a lot. I assume that's for a doorbell camera? (I don't use that) - what do you really get for that that is worth $300? Alternatively if you are saving that much for an engagement ring, talk to your partner to see if they want something that expensive."
BananasonThebrain,"This is really the best option - putting a good nest egg into an IRA, into a relatively boring, possibly index-based fund (there are a lot of suggestions through the side bar). I think the OP's suggestion of buying a house only makes sense if they will live in it and rent out rooms while in college, but that's also a lot of responsibility for someone who is also working and doing school. "
BananasonThebrain,"Just compare apples to apples with any other offer you have, and with your present needs. Eg if you need cash more than vacation maybe they are giving you a way to negotiate a higher salary at the cost of less vacation time. "
BananasonThebrain,"Honestly, no you are so young and need the money in &gt;30 years? So it will weather a substantial number of cycles (downs and ups). I would only do otherwise if you know you need the money sooner or have something weird going on with your employment or health. "
BananasonThebrain,"How stable are your jobs (the answer influencing the size of emergency fund)? I would at least kill the personal loan and think strongly about knocking off the bigger student loan. 

Pay off your credit car in full each month - it does you no good to carry a small balance from month to month and accumulate that interest. Moreover, budget carefully and consider what to cut, what to sell, and ways you could increase your income. "
BananasonThebrain,You can put as much at $6000 per year into a Roth IRA if you make that much in earned income. The Roth has the benefit of not taxing earnings. An early start there will allow the earnings to compound very nicely as a good egg for retirement. 
BananasonThebrain,"I think you can always fall back on an ""oooh, given your full benefits package, I need a higher base salary"" if there is a case to be made that the full benefits are 'less' than you 'expected'. Maybe the IRA match could be higher or the health insurance isn't what you had hoped, etc. Alternatively negotiating for different vacation time or flex time or for something to make the job easier (like secretarial help or a windowed office). "
BananasonThebrain,"Another idea - check on your health savings account to make sure you don't have any notifications there of 'receipts required'. My system has terrible notifications and I sometimes miss them, so have to log in from time to time. "
BananasonThebrain,"Yes! Start the Roth now. Even putting in $50-$100 a month will help you get in the habit of it and build up a nice nest egg of post-tax, tax-protected savings. Try to set it up so you automatically send a check there (eg auto withdrawal) as soon as you get paid. "
BananasonThebrain,"Can one of you find a way to increase income by $80 per month? Working one extra day per month at minimum wage, babysitting, working a gig-type job like cleaning up after a concert at the local arena, etc...

\[Sorry just read that you don't want to do overtime - maybe there are things you can sell from the house, or have your daughter cover some of that increase\]"
greenthumbgirl,"I had a miscarriage that required a d&amp;c in October. Similar situation except we ended up with one bill ~$6k and many smaller ones that added up to around $1k. I ended up applying for financial aid. Most hospitals have it and for higher incomes than you might think. Even though we had some (not enough) money in a HSA and a 3 month emergency fund, we qualified for an 80% reduction on the big bill. We had enough in the HSA to pay it at that point, so I didn't look into a payment plan, but I think they still had them available even with the reduction. Check out your bill for a number to call for financial aid. It will take some paperwork, but it's worth it."
greenthumbgirl,"Just so you know for the future, most hospitals have financial aid available. Even if you think you make decent money it's worth it to check out. I know the hospital by me has aid for up to 4x poverty level.

Secondly, ever if you don't qualify for financial aid, most hospitals have payment plans with 0% interest (or very low interest). They all have different terms, but for big amounts, they often have 2+ year terms."
greenthumbgirl,"You should aim for at least 10% total. 3% from you and 3% from your employer is 6%. You should aim for at least 4% more. That could be in your 401k if you have good options with low expense ratios or an IRA, either Roth or traditional"
greenthumbgirl,"I know you say wife staying home, and I'm a sahm so I get it, but could she work part-time to make $1000/month? I would operate in the red. I don't know what your retirement accounts look like, or how old you are, but unless you have been very good in the past, it will hurt. Could you stay where you are for a few more years? 

Just don't spend ~80% of your income on your housing. Mortgage+escrow+taxes+utilities ideally should be 1/3. I know you are in a HCOL area so I could see 1/2, but not 4/5."
greenthumbgirl,"Don't forget the social security tax as well. Plus health insurance, retirement, HSA contributions... I'd assume you'd get around 75% before this stuff to be safe. Then take off 10-15% for retirement. Guessing health insurance costs for someone else is like shooting at a dart board blindfolded so you'd have to ask at your job. If you qualify for an HSA you should contribute, even if it's only $100 per month. More if you have health issues."
greenthumbgirl,"Could you get a roommate for the house? You should be saving money on gas and maintenance on your car which will help. Wait until your raise is a done deal. Without a roommate, I think you will be fine, but it depends on your priorities. If you spend more on housing then it has to be given up elsewhere. 

Call the utility companies and ask for the yearly average for the house. $300 could be reasonable, or or could end up twice that. The rental house next to me has electric heat and is on the drafty side. My neighbors spent over $1000 per month last winter just on the one utility (Midwest state). My bills electric and gas never went over $250 per month. Plus water and sewer and trash. "
greenthumbgirl,"https://www.policygenius.com/life-insurance/

I found my and my husband's policy here. It was very easy. As for how much you need, it depends on your goals. Assuming you have children, do you want to pay for all their support and have money for college? Do you want to pay off the house? Do you expect it want your husband to work?

Given your income, you probably do want at least one million. Maybe more depending on your goals. I would get at least a quarter million to a half million. If he works, you will want to replace his income. If he stays home with kids you will want to pay for childcare and maybe housekeeping."
greenthumbgirl,"I think your biggest problem is income vs mortgage. Generally, you don't want to borrow more than 3x your income. That puts you at around $180k not $300k. Plus you need to figure on pmi, and condo fees. I think you would be hard pressed to make your payments."
greenthumbgirl,"Honestly, I'd work the overtime until your personal loan is paid off. That will free up $450 a month and combining that with a functional budget would make you a lot more comfortable. That's a place you can work on building an emergency fund from and start working on other goals like paying off your cars. It won't be glamorous, but in 3-5 years (depending on your car loans and work advances) you should be pretty comfortable."
greenthumbgirl,"If you can't get a car loan because of age or car value...

It might sound silly, but your could see if you qualify for a balance transfer card. My math says you owe around $6k. If you can get a limit that high, and pay as much as you are now until the 0% is over, you well be in much better shape. Your interest on what is remaining will be about the same, but you will be dove so much sooner."
greenthumbgirl,"But the second was this year. This bill won't really mean much because by the time your wife leaves the hospital, you will have paid your out of pocket max (or deductible if you have a great plan with no responsibility after the deductible) either way. This bill will just lower what you will pay later. It sucks, but giving birth in the US is expensive. I'm due in August and we'll hit my oop this year. $7300. I'm actually going to get some moles removed because it won't cost is anymore. 

Your 2018 bill is probably worth dealing with though. "
greenthumbgirl,"Depending on what was withheld while you were working, you might not end up owing anything. Most people pay in more than they owe and get a refund. If that was you then you just need to file and you can get a refund. I'd start with filling out the forms to see where you sit. If you come up with owing lots, then I'd hire someone to sort it out for you. Good luck"
greenthumbgirl,"Just for the future, don't drain yourself paying medical debt right away. They will send you several bills before even starting the collections process. Most hospitals have financial aid options, often up to 400% of poverty level for your family size. And if you don't qualify for any aid, most places will set up a payment plan with no interest over 6-36 months. 

I had a miscarriage in October that cost us over 7k. We were (are, I'm pregnant again) saving for the birth, but weren't anywhere close. I just resolved the financial aid and will pay my remaining bill this week. We even have an emergency fund the hospital knows about, but paying for a miscarriage and birth within 12 months would have seriously stressed our budget. If we'd had to, we could have covered it, but 14k in medical bills in 12 months would have taken all our savings. We have medical insurance too. "
greenthumbgirl,"With the interest rates that most cards have, $400 on $15k isn't going to get you far. Where is the rest of your money going. Getting a consolidation or personal loan could help, but you should first make sure no websites remember your numbers and either freeze your cards in water (so you can't use them) or give them to someone you absolutely trust. "
greenthumbgirl,"That person would have to live somewhere, supposedly they would be paying rent to someone of they weren't with you. They would still get the benefit of having a max they would spend on housing a month (is rent is the most you pay if you rent, but a mortgage is the least you pay if you own). As long as you talk about it prior to move in and you don't expect them to share in the bills when you have to replace the roof or remodel or whatever, I don't see an issue"
BlazinAzn38,"Retirement: Are you already maxing your 401Ks?

Buying a house: How much is a downpayment? How much will you get out of your current house?

Investing: Taxable brokerage account

Children: Do they have college funds?

These are probably some things a CFP(Certified financial planner) will ask you. You've managed to save up $500K over 20 years of working so you're doing something right but it looks like you think you should be doing more to get more."
BlazinAzn38,"That's honestly your issue, with 9 years of experience even if extremely varied is still valuable. An organization values someone who can kind of be a catch all and wear a lot of hats. Every time you switched and got more responsibilities, more important projects, etc would've been a great time to ask for a raise. Unfortunately the best time to get a raise is when switching employers as your current employer won't likely give you the raise you actually deserve which could be substantial. "
BlazinAzn38,Any time you get a call or text about fraudulent activity be wary. Politely say thank you I will call back to the number on the website or on the back of my card. Hang up and dial the number listed on the financial institution's site or on your credit/debit card and go from there.
buddy8002,Put it in a savings account instead.  If you want to invest it open a IRA and put it there.  I don't know why...but i fucking loath apps like robinhood and acorns Somehow I feel like investors in those will get boned one day.
buddy8002,"Damn, that expense ratio is high!  Don't worry about the age of the trust though.  If your target-date investments have lower expense ratios.... You might want to stay there.  To get more aggressive, just invest in the target date fund for the furthest-out year of retirement."
buddy8002,Really nobody knows what is the best strategy because the answer depends on your financial situation at retirement age 30-40 years from now.  I personally use payroll deductions to put 4% into a traditional 401k and max a HSA.  Then I max a Roth IRA.  I think worrying about the quality of the underlying investment and the fees you pay for your accounts is more important than worrying whether to invest pre-tax or post-tax.  Having a mix of both is probably best so you can be flexible with paying yourself in retirement.
buddy8002,"Yes you should because you get a automatic 100% return.  The account will be penalized at 10% + income tax if you cash it out but really there is no need to because you can easily roll it over into a future 401k.  Only thing to consider is if the money is ""vested"".  Many companies have a schedule where none of the match money is yours until you have worked there a certain amount of time.  These schemes vary from employer to employer. "
buddy8002,6.59% is not awful but it is kind of high.  I would consider making extra payments on this instead of putting money in retirement accounts until it is paid off.  Sounds like you got a good deal on the price though.  19k for a 2018 Altima is better than I did on my last car purchase.
buddy8002,"Buddy I move anything over 2k out of checking to a savings account every Friday (payday).  I pay my six credit cards from the savings account.  If the savings account balance gets high, like say 5k, then I move the excess into my IRA.  I'm not rich and powerful though and will probably work until age 70."
buddy8002,"Chase Ink Preferred buddy.  It's a business card, but really everybody is a business.  You need to be able to put 5k spend on it in 3 months though....maybe time the card application with a major purchase.  You will get $800 cashback."
buddy8002,Don't use it overseas if it charges a fee for use out of country.  Also you will not be able to use it at all if you don't call them and let them know that you want it authorized for use abroad.  This is true for debit cards too.  Many people open a Schwab checking account because you get a debit card that does not charge you for using ATMs in other countries.  
buddy8002,"What to do when you get laid off from the factory?  I've been working three years at a tire factory in USA. Now the company has decided to lay a few hundred of us off to ""streamline operations"". My time there means that I will get state unemployment benefits of $265/week and also something called ""SUB pay"" from the company that should mean that I will continue to receive a full paycheck every week for the next six months. Any formerly laid off workers of r/personalfinance, how does this work? Do I continue to make 401k contributions, HSA contributions, health insurance premiums from this pay? How much of a hassle is it to continue getting unemployment + SUB pay if I don't want to take a minimum wage job?  I posted this in r/povertyfinance as well, just looking for some guidance."
buddy8002,"It depends on your income and how reliable your income is.  If you can make the payments for the next four years. I would suggest financing a slightly used car with whatever down payment you can make and the rest paid over four years.  Shop around for the best interest rate.  I financed a 2 year old Honda Fit a couple of years ago and don't regret the decision.  The payment is $321/month but it will be paid off in a couple of years and then I think I will have a reliable ride for many years to come.  I got a 3% interest rate on my loan.  Your rate will be higher, but I wouldn't stress about it.  Just don't sign on to a loan with a crazy high interest rate.  "
buddy8002,I think you over-estimate the intelligence of people.  Or maybe I just have dumb friends.  All I know is that I have a buddy that thinks that the fraction of a share in some cannabis companies that they gave him for opening a account and referring friends is gonna make him rich.
buddy8002,I live below my means in a low-cost area of USA and I'm single.  I would say I could live comfortably at $30k pre-tax income.  Income above that would get spent to traveling during vacations and saving for old age.
buddy8002,"What are stocks? I'm a factory worker and I've got a little money invested in stocks.  Most of it is in a ETF and a couple of mutual funds that track the S&amp;P 500, but also I have a few shares of GOOGL.  What are shares of stock and why do they have value?"
buddy8002,I got TurboTax Deluxe for free. I started my return on TurboTax and it wanted to charge me $39.99 for Deluxe because I made a non-payroll contribution to my HSA.  I left the site and started returns on a couple of other sites (Credit Karma and 1040 .com)  When I came back to TurboTax I got a screen saying that I was getting Deluxe for free.  YMMV.
the_bagel_warmonger,"Hi. I work at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (nothing high up, just a researcher) and I wanted to talk about your question about bank failures.

The vast majority of banks are insured by the FDIC, which protects your bank deposits in the event of a failure. Now I know what you are thinking, ""if my bank fails I dont want to have to go through some government bureaucracy to get my money back!"", but that's not how it works.

When a bank fails, the FDIC essentially takes ownership of the bank. So If you go and use your debit card or an atm, that will still work. The only thing different is the the fdic handles those transactions.

Typically this doesnt last long, as we will sell the bank to another party, and your money will essentially be moved to another bank. FDIC insurance protects you up to $250,000, so unless you've got that kind of cheddar you are fine.

It is very unlikely that you are not fdic insured, but you can check your bank. If you are fdic insured the only way you could lose your money is a collapse of the us government. In that's scenario dollars dont really mean anything."
the_bagel_warmonger,"I struggle with this as well. The only way I can overcome it is by budgeting out money for myself every month. I use YNAB (YouNeedABudget), which basically helps you visualize all your expenses and dole out the money everywhere it needs to go.  When I do that, I set aside $75 for my Girlfriends priorities (mainly vacation) and $75 for my priorities (new pc and VR setup).

So when Christmas time came, and I had over a thousand sitting in that PC/VR budget line, I spent the whole damn thing without any guilt at all. I don't know about you, but for me the guilt of spending on myself primarily comes from the feeling of taking money from someone else. I love my girlfriend, I don't want to take money away from her. I wan't to have enough money for us to spend and save for all of our priorities.

Before I was budgeting, I always had the feeling that I was taking money from my GF or someone else. I could have $20k sitting in my account, and I would still have that feeling. Like, ""what if we need that money for a vacation at some point?"". Fully accounting for everything in that budget totally solved that issue for me, and I think it would really help you as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Start a budget, write down all your expenses (including annual and irregular expenses, try and budget for those monthly), set aside savings, and then see what is left over. Let's say you have $300 left over per month. Maybe you evenly split that between that between you, your wife, and your kid. Maybe you give your kid half, and then split the other half with your wife. Maybe you give all 3 of you 25%, and then leave the last 25% for stuff together.

&amp;#x200B;

No matter how you do it, as long as you have a full budget you won't have to worry about ""taking"" from anything anymore. Because you will know that your $60 video game isn't stealing from the vacation fund, because that is already taken care of and funded."
the_bagel_warmonger,"If you pay the card off before the statement close date, then it won't report on your utilization. Just go on to your CC website and find the statement dates. Let's say they typically run from the 5th of one month to the 4th of the next month (1/5-2/4). If you pay your full **CURRENT** (not statement) balance on the 3rd, then your Credit report will show 0 utilization. Or you can just pay it down as low as you want it to be.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a bit of a headache, because you cant set auto-pay to do this (or at least I can't), but it is worth it if this is only a temporary thing like you said."
the_bagel_warmonger,"When a bank gets to the point where it cant afford to fulfill its deposits, then it  is going to be below the regulatory capital requirements of the FDIC and would be put into receivership.

Theoretically a bank could withold deposits while above that level, but that would be highly unlikely. Doing so would likely cause a run on the bank that would put it into resolution anyways."
the_bagel_warmonger,"I like to explain it in terms of bowls. Imagine you had two bowls, one big, one small. Now imagine you put the small bowl inside the big bowl and then fill up the small bowl. Once it is filled, the excess spills into the next bowl.

Now imagine 7 consecutively larger bowls and you have the 7 tax brackets"
the_bagel_warmonger,"Consolidation loans can lower your monthly payments and make it easier to pay off debt, but only in the right scenarios. If you don't address the underlying causes that put you in this position, then those lower monthly payments will unfortunately enable you to go and get more debt. You need to make sure that you are absolutely committed to paying these off before you consider consolidation.

If I were you, I would put my nose to the grindstone and snowball this debt for a trial period of your choosing. Maybe a year, maybe a half a year, whatever you think will be necessary to assess whether or not you are disciplined enough to pay down the debt without adding more cc debt. If you stick to your budget, dutifully pay these loans down, avoid additional debt, and want to get out of debt faster, then consolidate the rest of it.

However, if you find yourself struggling to avoid adding new cc debt, then don't get the consolidation loan. Also note that most consolidation loans have terms of about 3 years or so. So you will likely want to pay more than their minimum payments to pay them off faster. If you do go that route, I would recommend paying an amount equivalent or similar to your old CC monthly payment. That way the extra will go to principal.

Additonally, with $24k in CC debt your credit score is likely going to be garbage, and you probably won't get good terms. Your utilization is simply too high right now. If you snowball (or avalanche) for a while, then your utilization will go down, your credit score will improve, and you will hopefully get better terms on a loan."
the_bagel_warmonger,"To bounce off of this, there is a great app called You Need a Budget (YNAB) that helps you actively do this. It is a subscription based app, but you can get it for free for a year as a student [here](https://www.youneedabudget.com/landing/students/). They don't take your CC info for the trial either, so if you don't like it you dont have to worry about forgetting about it and getting charged. 

&amp;#x200B;

The main principal of YNAB is taking the money that you have right now, and budgeting it out to your priorities, including irregular expenses (like tuition in your case).  I've been using it for about a year, and it has honestly been great for zero based budgeting. Check it out and see if you like it.

the_bagel_warmonger,"Personally I would not be comfortable with private share insurance, as it adds an additional layer of uncertainty regarding the safety of your deposits. Like I said to the poster above, the only way you lose insured deposits in a failed bank or CU would be if the US government itself failed. With private insurance, you have to consider the real possibility your insurer could  also go bankrupt. This is especially concerning in your case since smaller banks and CUs are generally more likely to fail.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day though, what is peace of mind worth to you? Are you just using this CU because you don't want to look for a new account, but are uncomfortable with private insurance? If so, I'd advise you to look for a new account. If you really like this CU and have a lot of faith in it then maybe you could stay. Personally I wouldn't want to deal with private deposit insurance, but then again as an FDIC employee my opinion may be skewed."
the_bagel_warmonger,"Hey. To bounce off everyone here, YNAB is pretty great and has been pretty life changing for me. If you're a student (or have someone's .edu email and student id you can borrow) they have a year long free trial. Otherwise, there is a 4 month long free trial. They dont take your cc info either, so you dont have to worry about those ""free until you forget"" trials."
the_bagel_warmonger,"Paying the minimum on CCs will not cause your balance to increase. However, it will cause you to pay down the debt VEEERRRYY Slowly.

Erekshen,"Well she works in the medical field and I am a business major, so getting a job at her place would be pretty rare.

Erekshen,"I kind of have to do the same thing lol. Smaller purchases I don't really care and just buy them. But for some reason anything over like $50+ I just have a hard time buying. I (26) still get into the college mindset that every penny counts. Whenever I go to spend money on a new game, new shirts, etc. I just have to turn away sometimes and just buy it and say ""oh well"". My fiance' gets mad at me all the time because she wants to go to a steak house for a Friday night dinner, but I lean more towards a diner to save some money lol. "

Erekshen,"Have $4.2k in a Rollover Traditional IRA from when I worked part-time. Worth taking it out? Hello all,   


As the title suggests I have a small some of $4.2k that is sitting in a Rollover Traditional IRA account. I accrued the money while I was working part time in college at an automotive store.   


I am moving into my first house next month and money will be pretty tight for the next few months. The house DOES NOT come with a refrigerator and washer/dryer. Would it be unwise to cash this out in order to pay for those? I know there are tax implications of around 10% from withdrawing the money early, but with finances being tight for a few months and these being necessities for a household, I don't really want to put these huge purchases on my credit card until I can recoup some money from the down payment.    


I know the ""financially responsible"" thing to do is to just not touch the money or transfer it to my 401(k) I have with my workplace, but being the money is going towards appliances that are long term, everyday uses I don't see it being a bad investment.   


What do you guys think?"
Erekshen,"As others have stated, if the vehicle is $17k after taxes and fees, I would bring a cashier's check for $15k then $2k in cash. If that price is without taxes, I would bring about $4k in cash for closing costs. The dealer shouldn't give you any problem at all doing this. When I bought my VW, they let me charge the down payment on 2 different credit cards in order to get points on both."
Erekshen,"Just make sure when you are seriously ready to buy that you have your 20% down on hand and ready to avoid PMI, you don't take out a loan bigger than you both can afford, and you have your emergency fund handled. With your combined income, I think the amount you make will more than make up the debt-to-income your SO has. Then it boils down to your credit history and all that. Compared to where you are from, you don't really get a whole lot for your money in Southern California unless you move to a city that is up and coming (Murrieta, Lake Elsinore, Menifee, certain parts of Temcula, etc.). With your combined income, I would stay far away from anywhere in the Orange County area as you won't get anything for your money; townhouses for example are going for 250 - 350k, and that is considered cheap for that area. Not sure where your job is based out of, but if you need area recommendations let me know.  


I would also try for cheaper leases. You can lease a newer Toyota Corolla for about $125-160 a month. Having that extra money every month would be great. Your future-wife should probably look towards a higher paying job as well.   
Good luck!"
Erekshen,"If the new job is in the same field and the company is reputable, I would say go for it. Most companies have a 60-90 day probationary period anyway. I would just let your supervisor know that this job was not what you fully envisioned for your career and you are grateful for the opportunity. Plus, government jobs usually hold resumes for a certain amount of time, so whoever was right under you in terms of interview performance, they can call them up."
Erekshen,"Don't finance now. Even if you have steady income with limited bills, you have no credit so your interest rate will be very high. I would save up about 5-6k then look for something on Craigslist/OfferUp. Not having a car payment and being bound that way is very nice. Once you save up more money and get a small credit card to start building up your credit, then I would sell that car and look to get something newer in a few years. Just my 2 cents. Good luck!"
Erekshen,"Help with House insurance quotes? Hello all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I just bought my first house and I am shopping around for insurance quotes. I am very new to this and only know as much as I have been able to research. Most places seem to be pretty high rates. I recently just received this quote from an affiliate of the builders of our house: [https://imgur.com/a/VvqPjTt](https://imgur.com/a/VvqPjTt)  
They said this is ""substantially less than what you might expect to pay.""   


It seems like a pretty solid deal considering the 150% ERC and lowish deductible. Can anyone with experience comment if this is indeed a good deal?   


Info about the house: Brand new construction (build March 2019), 2450\~ sq. ft, $500k cost, Frame-design, decent amount of upgrades, drip sprinkler system, smoke alarms throughout, etc.   


I can answer other questions as well if you need more info.   


Thank you for the help."
Erekshen,"Free is the best commodity...   


I would just wait it out. From reading comments you have posted you: 1). Are not miserable at your current job; 2). You are getting parts/all of your graduate degree paid for; 3). You sound like you don't have any current job offerings in the pipeline for finishing your MBA more quickly; and 4). You are able to save more money and not venture further in debt.   


Also, are there any stipulations in your employment contract stating you need to work at said company for X number of years in exchange for them paying for your schooling? If not, then I would just let them pay for it and then look for other work if you want to further progress. They are paying for your schooling as a perk to keep you at their company. I would let them continue to provide this perk. Why take on debt when you don't seem to have a reason to? Sure, you will finish your schooling more quickly. But, what would that do for you? Do you NEED the extra time for some reason? Do you hate schoolwork? Etc.   


Personally, it just seems like you should continue your same path and let your employer pay for your things. It is really hard to beat free.."
Erekshen,"The insurance company is an affiliate of the the builder of the entire development - aka their own insurance firm - so on the paper they gave us it word-for-word says ""we are authorized to offer you a Homewoners protection plan - at a cost substantially less than what you might expect to pay.

Erekshen,"Corona is a decent area. Plenty of more ""decent"" priced houses as far as California standards are concerned. Most of the neighbors are well kept. 

Chino is pretty hit or miss. A good amount of older houses. The 71 freeway can get bogged up at at times because it is only 2 lanes in each direction, so if there is an accident you are pretty screwed. 

I would look at Pomona or Upland as well if you are considering Chino. Plenty of good neighbors in each. Certain areas in Ontario are nice as well. "
Erekshen,"Highly unlikely you will get what you want. 

&gt; predecessor ran it into the ground 

You shared the reason why they paid you under what the average pay is. Very little does it have anything to do with  

&gt;They didn't want to start someone out high on salary that couldn't outperform their lower paid employees. 

If you are worth what you say you are, then the people that hired you know that too. Their place is going down the toilet and they wanted someone qualified to come in, accept lower pay and turn the place around..aka save the restaurant money. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would continue to work your position, update your resume, and just start cranking out applications whenever you can. Sounds like you have great experience and could get paid a lot more working for a more profitable location somewhere else. Try for at least 1 application per day. Eventually you will land something. Just my 2 cents.   


Good luck!

Erekshen,"Yes she would 100% vouch for me. I am very close with my boss's family, but I was just curious if it would look bad to recruiters looking at my application and seeing my boss and a reference both have the same last name. "
Erekshen,"Any way you can get someone to co-sign with you to drop your APR? \~7% is okay, but still pretty high. 

&amp;#x200B;

Other than that, just tell them you want their best out the door price and that you are a serious buyer if their price coincides with your budget. Don't give them a number; just tell them to give their best out the door price. Once that is received, you can negotiate from there. Go through each line in the contract and see what is offered, how much it is offered for, and why this line is so much, etc. Try to negotiate warranty into the deal as well. The car is a little bit older so it might be harder, but if it is a bigger dealer then they might budge on a 1 year warranty or something.   


Usually closing costs are typically around 10-12% with taxes/licensing/fees. So in your case, your car should be somewhere around $11,200 or so after all said and done. Anything above $11,500+ means they have added some unnecessary things to your contract. Good lucK!"

wisnowbird,"If your grandmother had 100 shares of XYZ mutual fund and the shares were split and transferred to your mother/aunt so they each had 50 shares of XYZ, there would be no capital loss/gain because that requires a sale.  Simply transferring the mutual fund shares into their individual accounts would be an unrealized loss/gain for each of them, which is not taxed.  If they sold their 50 shares each after receiving the mutual fund shares in their individual accounts, then they would then have a capital event.

One twist that complicates things, though, is if the mutual funds paid out dividends or recognized capital gains in December, as many of them do.  If the funds were still in your grandmother's name at that time, the estate would be responsible for paying any taxes on those events and an estate return could be necessary."
wisnowbird,"If she doesn't feel like she can confront them at this point, perhaps she can open a new account at a different bank, take $20 out of her current bank account periodically and deposit into the new bank account.

The specific term you're looking for is ""in-service 401k rollover"".  It's not that common, but some companies do allow it.  More companies will offer a 401k loan - up to half of your 401k balance or 50k, whichever is less.  Perhaps that would be an option?"
wisnowbird,"&gt; I dont think she has ever taken any money out for her RMDs

That's a little scary, considering the penalty for not taking them is 50% of the RMD!  One other thing to take into consideration is if she has an additional 34k of ordinary income this year, it could push her into the next level of being taxed on any social security benefits she may receive.  Although if she has significant interest coming in every month, she may already be at that level where 85% of her benefits are being taxed.  Just something to keep in mind, from a tax standpoint."
wisnowbird,"The last time I moved cross country, I found a three month furnished sublet where I was moving to.  I put most of my stuff in storage where I was moving from and filled up my car with the essentials for the next three months.

It wasn't a big deal - I just put it in the next weeks auction."
wisnowbird,"Probably minimal fees such as an account closure fee or a transfer fee.  When my dad died, I consolidated a few accounts to one institution and was charged around $75-100 from the ones that were left.

If he finds that contributing to an IRA brings him back to qualifying for a subsidy, he has until April 15th to make the IRA contribution - he'd just need to make sure he makes the contribution for 2018 and not 2019.  If it works out, it's so much better to contribute a smaller amount to his own retirement account than to pay the government back 24k for the lost subsidies!"
wisnowbird,"Perhaps their PCP accepts the PPO plan but not the HMO plan?  Lots of people like their doctors and don't want to switch.

wisnowbird,"It may just be the way you formatted, but I wanted to mention something about the HSA plan in case it wasn't made clear to you.  If it's HSA eligible, the plan will not pay for anything other than specific preventative care (annual physical, annual ob/gyn exam, etc) until after the 5k deductible is met.  So for your network provider, it's more like - Coinsurance: preventative care free, all other 20% AFTER 5,000 DEDUCTIBLE MET.  

A HSA eligible plan also can't pay for anything towards prescriptions until after the deductible is met.  So if you have a $100/mo prescription, you'd be paying for it in full until you hit the 5k deductible.  You'd be covered up to the deductible with your employer contributions, but just wanted to clarify how a HSA/HDHP works in case you aren't that familiar with them.

If everyone is healthy for the year, the HSA comes out on top because of your employer contributions.  If someone has a really bad medical year, the PPO will be better because of the lower out of pocket max.  They both look like decent plans and no premiums is excellent - no bad choice, in my opinion."
wisnowbird,"After my dad died, some of his investments paid out dividends in between his death and when my sister and I transferred the investments into our individual accounts.  Even though I'm a CPA, I don't specialize in taxes, so we hired an estate attorney and accountant who specialize in estates to do the estate taxes.  They listed all the dividends paid out under his name after his death on the estate return.  All dividends paid out before his death were listed on his final return."

wisnowbird,"Unless you get lucky with a neighborhood/unit appreciating, the closing costs to buy and sell probably aren’t worth it if you’re not going to be here long term.  When I bought my co-op, all the closing costs (attorney, appraisal, co-op application, etc) were around 12k.  When I sell, I’ll lose around 12% of the sales price in closing costs.  My co-op has a mandatory seller-paid 3% flip fee.  If you found one with no flip tax, it may be cheaper (they are pretty common for co-ops in the city, though)."

wisnowbird,"Different states, but a similar issue.  Many years ago, I moved from FL to NY in Feb.  By the time I filed my federal taxes for the previous year, I lived in NY and naturally used that address as my filing address.  A few years later, I received a bill from the state of NY saying I owed thousands plus penalties for the year before I moved to NY (the last year I lived in FL).  Since FL has no state income tax, I had no tax return to prove I lived there the entire year in question and didn't owe NY.  I provided all proof I could - HUD from the sale of my FL home, copy of my following year's NY state tax return showing I'd filed as a partial year resident, copy of my driver's license that showed the issue date around the same time I moved to NY.  It took them maybe a month to review the documents, but ultimately they sent me a letter saying they were satisfied I was a FL resident for the year in question and they removed all charges they'd said I owed.

If I were you, I'd start gathering any other documentation that you have proving your move date to include with the PA tax return when you receive it.  DC driver's license if it has an issue date, lease termination if you left an old rental, new lease if you started renting a new place (or closing documents if you sold/purchased property), etc.  The stronger documentation you can provide to show your move date and that you weren't a DC resident all of 2015, the easier it'll be for them to drop the case."

If your dad is filing with a spouse/other dependent, have him play around with TurboTax and see if contributing to a traditional IRA might bring him back under that cliff level.  So, for instance, enter into TurboTax that he contributed $1000 to a traditional IRA and see if that drastically reduces the taxes owed.  If not, keep going up as an IRA contribution.  If $1000 brings the amount owed way down, adjust the IRA contribution down until you find the level where the taxes go way up again."

nemoomen,"General advice: Make an honest budget as if you were paying the higher rent and see if you stick to it. Put the extra into savings. If you can do that for 3 months, you'll have an extra ~$1500 in emergency funds plus you'll know you can afford the higher rent. 

Also, the rule of thumb is 30% of monthly pay for max rent, that would be $540 in your $1800 months. $630 if you count the extra $300.

Specific advice: if your boss is offering you an extra $300/mo to move out...maybe look for an apartment that is $675 or less? That keeps your non-rent budget the same. You could get a new roommate and split a $1200 2-bedroom and come out ahead. "
nemoomen,"On average you will definitely get a higher return on like an S&amp;P 500 index fund. Average is like 7-10% long term, but in any given year it might be negative or flat.

nemoomen,"I don't think CDs are worth it. You can get a high interest savings/money market account at Discover or Ally for more than 2%+ interest, and you can take it out at any time.

How much can you save each month? You need a budget before you can plan for debt payoff.

I have heard of people negotiating with collections companies to reduce the bill and ""pay for delete"" to better their credit. Since the accounts aren't accruing interest anyway you should probably save up the money, then call the companies and see if they will settle for less if you give them a chunk of cash."

this [calculator](https://www.calcxml.com/calculators/how-long-will-my-money-last?skn=#detailedResultsTop) will help you understand how the money will distribute between 65-70. 

If she has 600k by the time she is 65, and takes out 2k a month for 5 years, assuming she is making 4% returns, she will end up with about 571k by the time she is 70. 

If that is her balance the year after she turns 70.5, she will have to take out about 20-30,000 minimum each year for RMD's, but it has to be according to the RMD schedule, and if you miss taking an RMD or do not withdraw the full amount, the penalty is 50% of the amount not withdrawn."

Kodkod87,"You can still contribute for 2018 as well, up to tax day. 

In terms of the traditional IRA, take the distribution, and then you will need to create a new one because that other account is a rollover. In this new account you will contribute for the backdoor Roth. 

You'll pay tax on the IRA distribution, and the backdoor Roth  you'll report on form 8606 along with the distribution. "
Kodkod87,"5 years with a Roth IRA. If it has been less, you can still take out your contrubutions without any taxable impact. 

 If the money inside of your 401k is pretax, you'll need to roll it over into a IRA (which you may not be able to do if you are still working there). From the  traditional IRA you can use up to 10k for a first time home purchase, no 5 years needed. The money however will be taxed as ordinary income when it comes out, but you won't have a 10% penalty for early withdrawal.

You'll be able to do this with your old 401k, but not necessarily your current one. For your current one, your options would be a 401k loan that will need to be paid back with interest, or a hardship withdrawal. The hardship withdrawal is taxable income and has a 10% penalty if allowed by your plan at all. 

Tbh, if you need to dip into retirement savings to pay for a down payment or closing costs or whatever, you're probably not ready to buy a house. "

Kodkod87,"&gt;My university had been paying me the stipend even after I left the university. I started a job as soon as I left the university and whenever I saw money in my account, I always thought it was a part of my paycheck from the job. I never checked my transaction history because I spend carefully and whatever money is left over I pay away my student loans with it. Since I've been using up all the money I had to pay up the loans, I never saved up anything. Now I owe the university $5390.

well this was going on for a long time, and you didn't question all of this extra money that you were not supposed to get? 

&gt;I just quit my job last month because of some issues with the job and I'm currently in between jobs. I don't have any income or I don't have any savings. And because I'm an international student, none of the banks would approve any personal loan for me.

Kodkod87,"You're confusing a currency exchange with the cost of living. Just because 1 dollar gets you 1.3 in Canada, doesnt mean you can but the same thing for that 1.3 Canadian dollars that you could buy for 1 American.

Kodkod87,"Sorry for your loss.

Good, that gets rid of a few headaches you might have with required distributions for a inherited 401k or tIRA. 

The cash in the account you can do with what you please, the assets you will need to figure out if they are any good for yourself, and if not what to buy instead. 

Your basis for the account would be set to the value of the assets on the date of death for whomever you inherited the account from. This can either be a good thing or a bad thing depending on when the assets were purchased orginally and at what price. If you decide to sell the stocks, you'll need to pay capital gains tax on any increase in your basis. If this person died recently, there is a decent chance that there may be very little or no gains at all. "
Kodkod87,"Generally the answer is no in terms of contributing to an IRA if you claim the foreign income exclusion, however there is a very narrow window in which you can make this happen. 

With the foreign income exclusion you are excluding up to 103,900 of your income from your US tax obligations. Basically this means that due to this exclusion, none of the 103,900 can be used for an IRA because you have excluded the income altogether.

If however you make more than 103,900 and less than the first roth IRA phaseout at 122,000, you can contribute any amount up to 6000. If you make 110,000 a year, your earned income for Roth purposes is 110,000-103,900=6100.

Another way to do it is to apply for the foreign income tax credit instead of the exclusion, however this will expose you to greater US tax liability. Basically you'll get a credit up to a certain amount for the local taxes you paid on your income. Anything above the amount of that credit however would be taxable US income, but it would also be earned income that you could contribute to a Roth IRA. "
Kodkod87,"Group life insurance is always cheaper by a significant amount than a personal policy. With a group policy, generally the health rating for everyone is baked in, so the people who are least healthy make out the best because they pay significantly less than they would with their own policy actually based on their health. The healthy are subsidizing the less healthy in this case. Even if you get supplemental insurance with their plan, it is usually cheaper than outside because your employer is still contrubuting as well. 

That being said, do you need insurance? Do you have dependents who would be in need if you suddenly passed? A mortgage? If so great, do a needs analysis of how much youd need each month if you passed or your SO passes, say for 20 years until your kids are grown. This amount will be your death benefit you apply for. Id apply for say a 30 year term policy and see what your rates are. If you are young and healthy, it is usually pretty inexpensive. 

Even if you do not need insurance, but you think you will need it soon, if you get it earlier, you will be saving money over time as it is cheaper the younger you are. "
Kodkod87,"Once upon a time I used to sell shitty life insurance policies like this. This isn't a good investment in the US as far as I know as much as it is used as a tax shelter by some. 

You have limited access to probably the issuing companies proprietary funds and maybe a few others they have agreements with, but your access to the wider market is limited. 

Idk who sold you on the fact that you can pull out your entire death benefit, as if youd have enough cash after your basis is only 66k?? That makes zero sense. I would have to see the schedule of premiums and cash values that they showed you where this math somehow works. Even if you made a 20% profit every year on the investments inside, the math doesn't work to get you anywhere near that 375k in terms of Cash value to enable you to pull it out."
Kodkod87,"This ☝️! Stop freaking out. A 401k is a very long term investment, when the market is down that means you are buying more of the same shares for less, which is great.

 You need to be ready for many bull and bear markets over 30 years, it will go up and down with the economy, it only becomes a worry as you get towards retirement age, and as you do you'll slowly change your investments to more conservative ones with more guaranteed returns and less risk."

Not the ones that want to buy and sells houses for you. I had a similar experience with an agent who we basically did all the work, she just signed me up for an email list. Then I met the realtor who sold me my house, he took my budget and places my wife and I wanted to live and came to me with 8 options and we went house hunting together for an afternoon.

thc1967,"&gt; my issues are pretty stupid in my opinion

Except they're not stupid at all if they're affecting you in this way.

No insurance coverage through parental units?

To the ""make more money"" query, I would suggest doubling down on your attention to schoolwork, unless you're already straight 4-point and have your volunteering in line to get into whatever college you want. The really good money almost always comes from a solid education.

If you have that in hand and you can't get another job and you're looking for valuable ways to ""distract yourself"", volunteering is actually a really good option for folks with depression. You might be surprised at how much helping others objectively less fortunate than you helps you."
thc1967,"If you know you can do 48 months, you can get a lower interest rate than taking the loan for 72 then paying in 48. The lower interest rate would save you money while paying off the car when you know you can anyway.

Never negotiate a car loan on monthly payment. You are concerned with principal (what you're paying the dealer for the car), interest rate, and any pre-payment penalties (avoid these). The rest is just math."
thc1967,"Depends on the carrier and maybe state regulations.

I had my daughter on my insurance policy at a time I couldn't claim her as a dependent. She lived out of state. That policy was not regulated in the state of PA though.

You'll have to dig in with the insurer to get the right answer.

How does she feel about you living with your boyfriend out of state?"
thc1967,"You told us a lot about your conversations and impressions of your current employer but not nearly enough about who you are, what you do, what geographical area you're in, and what you think you're worth based upon market analysis.

Ultimately you need to compare the job you're doing against other jobs in the same geographic area. Based upon that comparison, how does your pay line up?  If you're low enough that you care about it, then do you realistically think you can get paid the higher amount if you leave? If so, what's the harm in shipping a resume or 3 out to potential employers?"
thc1967,"Depends on what they are.

If they're American, the one with 50k miles. The 100k mile one is probably going to cost you a fortune.

If they're Hondas, then see if you can get maintenance records, but probably still the one with 50k miles since you don't care about 5 year newer creature comforts and it still should theoretically last longer than the 100k one."
thc1967,"Bonuses aren't taxed any more heavily than regular income, though it might increase your marginal tax rate on some of your income. Assuming you're in the USA, anyway.

At a delta of $2 an hour, you will need to work 5,000 hours, or about 2.5 years, to make that $10k back. Less time if you expect to work overtime, less hours if you get paid more than straight time for overtime.

Do you think you'll get a raise of $2 or more within 2.5 years? If so, take the bonus."

&gt; Do all car companies keep jacking up their prices leaving people to constantly have to change them?

Yep. The only explanation I can fathom is that they're really fucking stupid. It costs a lot less to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one, but they keep jacking up the prices on existing customers inviting them to shop around.

I shop every renewal period. Even if they don't arbitrarily increase my price. And I change at most of them."
thc1967,"If you're in the US, in some states, that's illegal to ask.

Boilers99,"At 23, what is the rush to own a house?  Are you really ready to settle into one place for several years?  Houses have large transaction costs.  Financially you may be better off waiting.  What if you meet your partner tomorrow and they want to live in another part of town?"

Boilers99,It's unclear why the Roth even comes into play.  Was it backdoor or something?  You only had 60 days to put the rollover checks into an IRA.  It sounds like that times has passed.

huskyskins,"You could probably get a Home Equity Loan or Home Equity Line of Credit.  Be wary though, HELOC's often have variable rates, and the rates seem to be creeping ever upward.  And, you're not going to get a loan in the 2nd position at nearly the interest rate of the first.  Depending on your credit, you'll be upwards of 8%, maybe quite a bit higher.

Here's some advice: I did exactly this about 12 years ago.  Took out a 30-year 2nd mortgage for $70k on my house in 2007 to cover high interest debt I had accumulated.  12 months later, I was underwater on my house.  12 months later, I lost my job.  That's a very precarious position, as now all my debt was wrapped up in my house.  If the credit card company doesn't get paid this month, oh well.  If the mortgages don't get paid, they can start foreclosure.  That was a lot of stress.  If I had it to do over, I would have attacked my debt without involving my primary residence.  Your risk level may be different."
huskyskins,"Yes, but make sure that price is ""out the door.""  You'll find there are a ton of taxes, registration, fees, etc. that might not be on the quoted price.  Your best bet is to go to your credit union and get pre-qualified for a loan up to a maximum amount.  Bring that prequalification with you to the dealership, but don't show them until after you have negotiated the price.  If you tell them up front how much you're approved for, they'll find a way to make whatever car you're looking for cost that much out the door."
huskyskins,"You spend on rent, what the market allows.  The more you spend on it, the less you have to tackle debt, so look for something as cheap as possible until you can retire this $50k+.  Maybe look at subletting or a roommate situation.  Overall, you don't want to typically spend more than 25%-30% of your income on rent/mortgage.

As far as paydown strategy, there are two widely used methods: Snowball and Avalanche.

Snowball you would pay them off in this order: (lowest balance first)

1. car
2. credit card
3. private student loans
4. Federal student loans

Avalanche you would pay them off in this order: (highest interest rate first)

1. Private student loans
2. car
3. Federal student loans
4. Credit card loans (however, this jumps to #3 if needed to pay off before interest starts to accrue)

On both systems, you pay minimum payments on all loans, and every extra dollar in your budget goes to the highest priority debt.  Snowball gets you some early payoff wins to motivate you to stay with it.  Avalanche saves you the most money in interest payments.

If you are religious about paying off all this debt, you can churn through it in less than 2-3 years.  If you party your money away and only pick at your debt, This could hang around for a decade."
huskyskins,"Pay off your debts next month or two months, but don't close the accounts.  Your credit score is dependent on the amount of available credit you have, your oldest account, the number and types of accounts, and your utilization.

I would advise against buying a house before establishing an emergency fund of 6-12 months of expenses.  Inevitably, you'll buy the house, and some catastrophe will hit.  You'll then have to take out a loan to cover.  You won't have enough equity in the house to get a secured loan at a good rate, so you'll be paying ridiculous interest.

Neither you, nor your wife, have outstanding credit scores.  You want to be on the high end of the 600's, minimum.  Whatever revolving credit you do have, make small purchases every month and pay the whole balance, religiously.  Do this while saving up for a 20% down payment.  I know there are ways to get into a home with 5% down or less, but you'll have to pay extra in rates, PMI, etc."
huskyskins,"Your savings account is for your emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses.  Like, you lost all ways of making money for  3-6 months.  Build it, set it, and leave it there.  If you want to almost keep up with inflation, find a high-yield savings account online, like Ally.

Your checking account can be used for paying monthly bills, taking out cash, etc.  You don't want to keep the bulk of your money here, because it's not making interest.  Keep the months expenses, plus a reasonable buffer, so you don't overdraft.

Anything excess can be handled in a few different ways:

1. Separate savings account for near-term savings (vacation in 5 months, down payment on house, etc.)
2. CD's of varying lengths get you a better interest rate, but you can't access the money until they mature.
3. Brokerage account for investing, but you may lose money.
4. Retirement accounts including IRA's and 401k, but you can't take out the money without penalty until retirement age.
5. College savings plans like 529 plans.  This must be used for education expenses.

huskyskins,"As far as the IRS is concerned, all earnings should be reported.  An LLC might be overkill at this time.  But, you should look at at least registering your business as a sole proprietorship.  I'm not a lawyer, so you should consult one and/or a tax professional."
huskyskins,"Let's take a look at WHO is telling you what you can afford.  The LENDER makes more money, the larger the loan.  Your real estate AGENT makes more money, the larger the loan.  These people/institutions do not have your best interests in mind.  Buy what you need, for as little as you can.  Don't buy into the ""affordable"" myth, or you'll be broke your whole life."
huskyskins,"They have to walk the fine line between using you as an independent contractor or an employee.  If they tell you how much you will be making, how often to work, etc. they could cross the line and then have to pay you benefits.  As an IC, you're supposed to be completely independent.  The company contracts with you to do work, in this case repairs.  They pay you on a per-job basis instead of hourly.  In theory, you're in control of the hours you work, which jobs you take, how you do the jobs, tools used, etc.  However, the company can choose to not give you any more jobs if you turn down a job, don't work during their work hours, don't dress properly, etc.  Also, there's no guarantee of how many jobs you'll get, because theoretically, that is up to you."
huskyskins,"Those are the two schools of thought.

A zero-sum budget will have you saving every non-spent dollar.  When you decide to save it (beginning or end) doesn't really matter, and it will be different every month.

A pay yourself first budget will take some percentage of your earnings and squirrel it away.  The rest will be used to pay expenses.  The remainder can be used for whatever you want whether it is carried over to the next month, splurged on whatever, or added to savings.

The pay yourself first budget is very unforgiving, but that is on purpose.  If you wait to pay yourself with what is left at the end of the month, you're more likely to not have any left.  If it is gone before you start spending on other things, you are more likely to find away to make your lifestyle fit the remainder."
huskyskins,"Make sure you don't have to pay interest on the original balance if you miss the 0% period on those two.  Because, at $600 per month you're not going to get to both of them.

If no penalty - pay 1, 3, 2.  If penalty, I'd clear 3 first, if you can make it in time."
huskyskins,"The great myth of home ownership is that it is somehow cheaper than renting.  Yes, rents increase.  But, you know what else increases?  Taxes, insurance, maintenance, etc.  And, as others have said, you're eventual significant other probably won't like your house because of age, location, layout, whatever.  The average person only stays in a house 5-7 years.  In that time a vast majority of your mortgage payments go to interest, so you build very little equity other than market value.  It used to be that you at least got a nice tax break for all that interest, but now fewer people can claim that tax break due to the higher standard deduction.  Keep renting, and only buy a house to rent out to some other schmuck."
huskyskins,"You sound like you could benefit from the envelope method.  Real cash has a different psychological factor than using cards.  Plus, you'll get the actual internal battle between ""I want that"" and ""I really can't afford that"".  Or, ""how can I find a way to afford that?""  However, be a little forgiving the first couple months, because you probably don't ""really"" know how much you spend on food/dining/drinks and random stuff/trinkets/widgets.  But, you'll learn really quick."
huskyskins,"I assume that is the annual payout, so for 20 years at the company, you'd get $60k/year.  No wonder they supplement with a 401(k).  

It doesn't really matter if you compare present value or future value.  In either one, you'll have to estimate the interest rate of the comparable plan (IRA, 401(k), etc.)."
huskyskins,"""Focus Danielson""

If you're paying the minimums on your debt and your savings isn't going up, then you're maxed out, and that is your main problem.  If you're paying more than the minimums and trying to save at the same time, you won't see much progress on either.  It is best to focus on one, or the other.  And, when you focus on your debt, focus on one while paying minimums on the rest."
huskyskins,"There are two widely accepted methods, and both have you focusing on one debt at a time.

Snowball - list your debts smallest to largest balance.  Pay minimums on all debts.  Apply any extra on the smallest balance until paid off.  Rinse and repeat monthly.

Avalanche - list your debts largest to smallest interest rate.  Pay minimums on all debts.  Apply any extra on largest interest rate.

The Avalanche method will save you the most in interest, but may take some time to really get going if your largest balance is also your largest interest rate.  The Snowball will have you paying off something sooner, which can be a nice ""win"" that gives you the feels to keep going."
huskyskins,"I suggest halting emergency savings until you pay off that expensive car.  So you could put an extra $1300 towards the car every month and get it paid off.  Then build up your emergency fund with the $1810 per month.  Once that is done, fund retirement (401k, IRA, self directed brokerage, etc.) with at least 15% of your gross income.  The remainder can go towards money-making endeavors (stock market, property, business).

Most important piece of advice I can give you, is to take a snapshot of your current existence.  You're going to fairly comfortably live off $75k a year.  In 5 years, when you're salary is $110k, you can live off of $89k (adjusting for inflation).  That's about $20k extra to invest.  Don't get trapped into rising expenses with rising salary."
huskyskins,"First, if I only get the death benefit, and not the cash value, I am essentially forfeiting the cash value.  This is the problem with WLI.  For the same $50k benefit, I could pay substantially less for TLI.  I could pay $15/mo for TMI and put the other $40 in an IRA getting 8%.  If she dies, I get the $50k and the IRA.

With the WLI policy, I can borrow against the cash value until she dies.  Then I get the $50k minus what I owe on anything I borrowed.  So, I'm essentially out what I've put in.  Or, am I wrong on that?"
huskyskins,"Make it a 1 year payment plan and stop wasting the interest payments.  Focus on one thing at a time with any extra income.

1. Pay off consumer debt (car loans, credit cards, student loans, etc.)
2. Then, build emergency fund
3. Then, invest for retirement
4. Then, invest for wealth."
huskyskins,"You're going to want to be a lot more specific to get any good help here.  A family of four living on $5k in Wahoo, NE is different than one living in San Francisco.  Are the student loans your only debt?  If you know your other expenses, please share."
huskyskins,"When I was out of work for a year our living expenses decreased considerably.  The childcare bill was almost totally eliminated.  I also prepared lunches and cooked dinners, so dining out dropped off.  I also cut coupons like crazy, and saved a ton on groceries.  Between my employment security check and the drop in monthly expenses, we barely dipped into the EF except for a car breakdown."
huskyskins,"Your credit score will benefit from paying down your utilization (credit used divided by credit available).  But, don't close any of the accounts.  Closing an account will reduce your available credit and may affect your length of credit.  Your best way to improve your score is to pay off your balances, then use the credit cards to make purchases you will pay off every month.  A great way is to set up regular payments like utilities on them.  Then pay them off every month."
huskyskins,"Paying a set amount per month is only one term of a personal loan to consider.  How many payments are you expected to make?  What is the interest rate?  What if you miss a payment?  It may be a terrible trade-off, or it might be a great deal.  If he's sitting on this money in a savings account making 1%, then anything more than 1%, and less than 6% is a good deal for both of you.

Whatever you do, get the terms (loan length, monthly payment, interest rate, etc.) in writing.  Then, if you decide to chunk it at the private loan, you'll have made a major leap towards paying it off.  If instead, you decide to pay off as many of the smaller debts as you can, you gain more monthly cash to put toward that big debt.  It is not as efficient as paying the higher interest rate, but 2% isn't that big of a spread.  And, cash flow might be better in case of a catastrophe."
huskyskins,"It has a variable interest rate currently at 6%.

So, what is the benefit over all the money going to a high yield savings account?  I mean, other than the $50k value if she dies.  And, at that point, I would forfeit the cash value."
huskyskins,"If you have a bunch of small public loans, are they separate?  Do you pay them separately, or do you make one consolidated payment?  If they are separate, you can pay off the smallest balance ones.  Then, there won't be minimum payments for those.  The cash that would be allocated to paying those can be used to pay off other small debts.  When all the small debts are paid, you can use all that extra monthly cash to pay towards the big one.  This is generally referred to as the Snowball Method of debt payoff.  It frees up cash flow the fastest, and to a lot of people, cash flow is more important than saving 2% on interest.

For example, if you pay off $20k of those $23k public loans, maybe you pay off all but one $3k loan out of the bunch.  You go from paying $230/month towards them to paying $30/month.  Or, whatever it ends up being.  That difference of $200 continues to be applied toward that last $3k public loan.  But, if some financial hardship happens, you can stop paying that $200 toward the loan and put it somewhere else each month.

On the other hand, if you chunk the whole $20k toward the private loan, cash flow doesn't change.  The loan balance goes down, but you still owe the same amount every month until it is paid off.  If that same financial hardship happens, you have no flexibility to adjust payments."

Some required a specific major, and so on.

Tobric93,"No. First off, if you donate in 2019, it counts towards 2019 taxes.

flexible_dogma,"And by 5.2%, [do you mean 4.1%](https://salemcountytax.com/tax-rate-breakdown/)? [note: they seem to be using $ markers instead of % on this website for unk reasons]

4.1% is still high, but it comes out to ~$5000/year, not $8500/year.  If you really want to make this decision on financial grounds [again, see my original comment about all the other factors that should play in here], your first step should at least be to get accurate tax/cost estimates."
flexible_dogma,"Details are going to be very important here.  Did your friend write a check at any point here?  Or is he/she claiming that somebody they have never met wrote a check and the bank processed it as if your friend had written it out of their account?  If your friend deposited a check that subsequently bounced [a common check fraud/scam scheme], then they are likely SOL.  If instead they never deposited a bad check and never wrote a check themself for this amount, then they should talk to their bank's fraud department ASAP.  They may also need to file a police report."
flexible_dogma,"The landlord is entitled to as much profit as the market and local laws will allow him.  If he added the utility thing after you moved in, your parents should carefully review the lease they signed to see if he has the right to charge them for utilities.  But if they have since renewed a lease that does include the utilities, then unless local laws prevent such things they're probably stuck.  Legally, there's no such thing as a ""fair"" rent, except whatever people are willing to pay.  If your landlord has owned the house a while (or even not that long if prices are going up in the neighborhood), it's very common for rent to be significantly more than the mortgage payment.  After all, this is why people become landlords."
flexible_dogma,"Weird.  Maybe the IRS decided your grant wasn't taxable?  Though I agree with you that generally stipends (NSF grants, etc) are in fact taxable, other than the portion used to cover tuition of course.

flexible_dogma,"&gt; I guess opening a ROTH IRA would not really diversify my investment at all?

Well, it would depend on what you chose to purchase within the Roth IRA.  If you want to own some particular individual stock, or if you want various emerging markets index funds, neither of those are available with TSP right now.  But if you open a Roth IRA and make it 80% total US stock market and 20% international stock market, then no you really haven't added anything over the C/S/I allocation you listed."
flexible_dogma,"What kind of account did you roll into the Traditional IRA?  If it was a typical 401k/457/403b, then yes, these contributions were likely made pre-tax and therefore subject to the pro rata rule.  Also keep in mind that your *earnings* in your Traditional IRA are considered pre-tax, even if the contributions were non-deductible and therefore ""post-tax"".  The fact that you have ""several"" Traditional IRAs does make me highly concerned that you are in fact subject to the pro rata rule."
flexible_dogma,"Verbal agreements are also valid, just harder to prove in court if it comes to that.

flexible_dogma,"This DRASTICALLY changes the answers you are getting in this thread.  I would recommend updating your post to reflect this.

At this point, the money is still in a retirement account, it's just not invested well.  If you like the company it's currently with, you can leave it there and use their website to change what it's actually invested in.  They may have some kind of ""Target Retirement 20XX"" fund that would be an easy set-it-and-forget-it choice.  

Alternatively, if you don't like the company (honestly, I have no opinion on Principal Financial), you can always transfer the funds to a different company like Vanguard/Fidelity/Schwab.

I would STRONGLY advise against withdrawing money from this account.  Not only will there be a big tax hit (with some exceptions), but you also lose out on having that money in a retirement account."
flexible_dogma,"It will likely be fine.  The name on your bank account doesn't even have to match the name on your tax return--this is one of the way scams/frauds work.  Your bank may have fraud protections that prevent deposits that don't match the name, but middle name vs middle initial vs no middle name will rarely lead to any rejections."
flexible_dogma,"Non-custodial parent info (including that of the non-custodial parent's new spouse) is absolutely required by some schools.  I haven't done this in 10+ years, but I recall that at least in the past there was a way that the noncustodial parent (and spouse) could submit their information without the student or custodial parent being able to see it.  Have no idea if that still exists.  

Also, while you may say that you have no intention of supporting your husband's daughter, from the perspective of financial aid offices, you and your husband are a single financial unit.  "
flexible_dogma,"I'm a little confused--you say you opened a *second* Roth IRA brokerage account with Vanguard?  Where's the first one?  

You can always cash out the investments in your brokerage account and use that money to fund your Roth.  Do note that if you've had any gains, you will owe capital gains and/or income taxes on those gains.  Also, you say you are a college student--do you have any earned income for the year?  Your IRA contribution for a year cannot be more than your earned income for the year.  

Edit: Just saw the bottom part of your post where you say you have student loans.  Why did you put 2k in a brokerage account while taking on student loans?  While not ""exciting"", paying off your loans is a guaranteed 5% return on investment.  I'm all for retirement savings, but sounds like you have some other priorities (like graduating and getting a job!) to take care of first."

That is, they pass directly to the named beneficiary and other creditors (hospital, banks, etc) don't get any claim to them.  You note in your OP that you are ""only her POA here at the hospital"", so there's likely nothing you can do regarding making sure her IRA has a beneficiary named.  If she is lucid and of sound mind to make legal/financial decisions (unclear from your post, but sounds like probably not?), then you could certainly encourage her to make sure this is taken care of. If she is of questionable mental faculties, then tread very carefully.  A local family/estate lawyer may be helpful here."
flexible_dogma,"Even without penalties for early withdrawals, CDs still have disadvantages over savings accounts.  Specifically, you can't add more money to a CD later, if interest rates go up you would need to cash out the CD and reinvest it again, and if you do need the money it will probably take a few days to get it out."
flexible_dogma,"Traditional vs Roth IRA is a complex question with lots of factors.  The [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional) has a nice article on this.

flexible_dogma,"Insurance varies wildly state-to-state and sometimes even company-to-company.  Review your policy, and call your agent/company if you have questions.  

In terms of ""proof"", if you got in an expensive accident and your insurance company had reason to believe you were engaged in a non-covered activity (eg, if the cop writes ""grub hub thermal delivery bag on passenger seat"" in their report), then they can ask you under oath about your activities, or they can potentially subpoena grubhub's schedule/delivery records for your account.  Also, they have every right to just ask you ""were you delivering food at the time of the accident?"" and answering untruthfully is insurance fraud, which is a very serious crime in most states."

flexible_dogma,"A few possibilities:

* Any portion of your grant used to cover your tuition/fees/etc probably wasn't taxable.

* Are you sure you entered all of your quarterly tax payments correctly in TurboTax?  If you mis-typed (or forgot) 1-2 of them that would certainly explain the discrepancy.  

* The IRS will send you a letter in the next few weeks explaining why they made this change--just review it and make sure it seems right.

* Finally, if you made a total of 30k last year, your federal tax burden is only ~$1900 for the year.  How much did you pay in estimated taxes over the year and how much is listed as withheld from your W-2?"
flexible_dogma,"Income for CC applications is self-report (there's no national database of wage data, FYI), so it's really whatever you ethically/legally feel comfortable with.  I think you could reasonable report an annual income of 15k (probably even 20k if you expect that's what you'll make this year), assuming this government job is starting sometime relatively soon.  Discover's application, for example, only asks you to state whether you are unemployed/full time/part time, and to list your annual gross income.  Assuming you have a firm job offer that you have accepted and the job will be starting around the time you get the card, it is certainly reasonable to list that income as your annual income at this point."
flexible_dogma,"The address listed for you on your W-2 isn't all that important.  What matters more is which state your employer sent your tax withholdings to, and also making sure you file taxes in any states you might be required to.  This likely includes: the state you worked in, the state you lived in while you were working (if different), and the state you live in now.  Each state has their own rules for full-year- vs part-year- vs non-residents, so make sure to read through it all carefully."
flexible_dogma,"Common?  No, but you can certainly do it.  There really isn't any downside as long as your employer makes it reasonably easy to update your direct deposit multiple times/year and/o split paychecks between multiple accounts.

flexible_dogma,"Generally it won't be as much about how long after you close on the house, but about what your debt-to-income ratio looks like after you take on the mortgage.  

Your post also has several very concerning things listed:

-Car loan having 16k left: any car that appraises for 15.5k likely isn't ""getting up there in miles"".  If your trade in doesn't cover the outstanding balance of the loan, you'll need to provide the difference in cash to even close out that old loan.  Why exactly are you planning to trade in a car that's still (supposedly) worth 15.5k?

-CC loan for 3k: pay this off ASAP.  Like, before even considering taking out a new car loan.  Why are you sitting on 17k in a savings account while this is outstanding?

-LendingClub PL for 15k: Not as dire as the CC, but still is way higher priority than replacing the car.  What's your interest rate on this?  If it's anything over ~5%, this should be dealt with ASAP.  Again, I don't really understand how you have an outstanding personal loan for 15k when you also have 17k sitting in a savings account, unless your interest rate on this loan is fantastic.

You currently have 18k in unsecured debt, plus a 16k car loan.  That's 34k in non-mortgage debt, which is a lot for someone who's been making $19/hour.  Yes, I realize your financial situation just changed quite a bit with the raise to 58k/year, but it's still troublesome that you managed to accumulate this much debt.

(Not that you asked, but hard not to comment: buying a house with a non-spouse/non-fiancee can end up being a huge mess.  If you choose to go through with this, make sure you get a lawyer to help you come up with a contract about how you determine who owns what portion of the house/etc.)"
flexible_dogma,"Financially, paying off your IRS debt is a guaranteed 6% ROI, whereas funding your IRA is a gamble.  Regardless, make 100% sure you get on a formal payment plan with the IRS (if you don't plan to pay the full amount within the 120 day ""automatic"" payment plan option) or else you can be subject to additional ""failure to pay"" penalties on top of the interest/underwithholding penalty/etc.  "
flexible_dogma,"Are you eligible to make a Roth contribution?  If so, the easiest thing would just be to call your broker and ask them to do a Roth *[recharacterization](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/ira-faqs-recharacterization-of-ira-contributions)*.  Basically, they just update everything to make it as if you had made a Roth contribution in the first place.  

Now, if you aren't eligible for Roth contributions either, then you'll want to do a Roth Conversion.  HOWEVER, if you have any existing Traditional IRA contributions from prior years where you *did* take a tax deduction, this may or may not be a good idea due to the pro rata rule.  If this applies to you, please let me know and I can explain this, but it's pretty esoteric.  Since you say your IRA has declined in value, a Roth conversion (assuming again that you don't have any other Traditional IRAs) would not lead to any tax consequences for you.  You still wouldn't be able to deduct the Traditional IRA contribution from last year, but at least the money would be in a Roth instead of Traditional account, so the earnings will grow tax-free.  "

jlcnuke1,"If you're spending 1/3rd of your take-home pay currently, then you're probably in good shape as that leaves 2/3rds of your pay to cover living expense (rent + utilities) and savings/investments. Split the remaining 50/50 and you'll have a 33% savings rate, which should be great for you long-term if you stick with it.   


Optimizing your budget further would obviously be more financially beneficial, and it seems like that is a goal you have, so stick with it. Online tools like YNAB or Personal Capital etc can help you track your spending, especially if most of it is done electronically (it won't tell you where that money you pulled from the ATM went though, gotta do that manually).  


keep on this path and you should have your personal finances well above average for your age group consistently, and eventually even reach financial independence."

I agree that years ago, before the rise of ETFs over the past 2 decades, index funds pretty much only existed as mutual funds. These days, however, you can invest in an index using either exchange traded funds or mutual funds. When someone these days says they recommend using a Vanguard total market index fund they could be talking VTSAX or VTI and you wont' know which they mean unless you ask, though really it only matters if you can't decide which type of fund you'd prefer to be in. In fact, I'm 100% certain that many places still are only referring to mutual funds when they talk about index funds (while obviously others do not), and I can even find places that say an ETF is a mutual fund that trades differently than ""traditional mutual fund"", which makes them ETF mutual funds if you listen to those experts. The terminology is not well thought out with how the market has changed over the years imo.

In a practical sense, for choosing an investment allocation, whether an investor is in VTSAX or VTI doesn't really make any difference. "
jlcnuke1,"First off- determine how much you need for an emergency fund - set that aside (literally or figuratively) in a high yield savings account (Ally is a pretty good one for that). Next up - fund your IRA for the year (Roth probably, but maybe traditional). Next up, determine what you're going to use the money for, and when.  


Short term spending with it (home down payment in the next couple years etc) should go in high yield savings. Long-term goals (like retirement, establishing financial independence, etc) should be invested in low-cost index funds similar to a lazy portfolio (explained at Boglehead's wiki... Google it) or similar vessels.  


IF you have access to a HSA and/or workplace retirement plan, those should be utilized in your future planning as well."
jlcnuke1,"Expense ratio is accounted for before they tell you past returns. That fund reporting it got a 1,233,454% return over the past 5 years did so after taking their cut (because performance reports are what the investor actually got, after paying the expense ratio not before), so it clearly did better than the fund which returned 4% over the past 5 years, regardless of either fund's expense ratio.  From a ""gross"" point of view moving forward, the higher expense fund needs to outperform the other fund by the difference in expense ratios to have the same return moving forward.

The odds are that the two funds aren't investing in the same things though, so just looking at expense ratios would be fairly pointless.

Glad you understand that that high-fee fund is likely to suck going forward relative to basic, low cost, index investing though."
jlcnuke1,"Yes, but only barely. Credit utilization of 0% causes a slightly lower credit score than having very low credit utilization, but in the long-run it won't likely be significant enough to bother with. The best way to use credit cards to maximize your credit score is to have a very small balance and pay that off each billing cycle so you don't pay interest but your credit utilization shows that you are responsibly using your credit cards."

jlcnuke1,"If your company doesn't do a true up match, then you'll miss out on free money.

Consider the following scenarios:Paid twice a month, with a 10% company match each pay period, making $100k/year, you max out your 401k 1/4 of the way through the year. So you put in $19k, and your company matched 10% of your pay in each of those pay periods for $2,500 total employer contribution (10% of your pay for 1/4 of the year). Then you stop putting money in, so they also stop putting money in. Total money put into your 401k that year $21,500.If instead you maxed out on the last paycheck of the year, they would have given the 10% match for the whole year, meaning you put in $19,500 and they put in $10k, for a total put into your 401k that year of $29,000. Maxing out early would have cost you $7.5k in free money from your employer.

2. Automate savings - if it happens automatically, you don't have to think about it or worry about it. It's taken care of and you can now live your life without thinking/worrying about it. If you're living a life where you live below your means, you shouldn't have to think about your finances on a regular basis.
3. Enjoy the rest - you've set your savings/investing goals, be happy that you're meeting them and enjoy your life. If that means you have the money to turn that stay-cation into an enjoyable week sipping fruity drinks on a white sandy beach - enjoy it!

jlcnuke1,"Do you pay the premium, or does your employer? This question is important because it changes how taxes work. If you pay 100% of the premium, then you get the full 70% of your pay with no taxes at all due on that money. If they pay it, then it is taxable income. If you split it, then it's partially taxed.  


For most people with an average or higher income, getting 70% of it after taxes is adequate to maintain their current spending (since you won't have to pay income tax, SS, etc out of the checks, won't be contributing to the 401k or other retirement plan(s) since you don't have income).   


Next up:  
How tight is your budget. If you currently save 30% of your gross income, then getting 70% of it, even if it is taxed, is likely to be more than adequate to cover you in the event you become disabled. If you're currently living paycheck to paycheck, saving/investing nothing and barely having enough money left over to eat with, then you need to do two things - 1. fix your spending problem and 2. get more disability insurance in the interim.

jlcnuke1,"You should pay it in full each month, and try to have the statement balance between 5-10% of the card's limit when you get ready to do something that requires your credit score (for the couple months leading up to that point or so). Otherwise, just don't buy shit you wouldn't/couldn't pay for in cash and pay it off each month and you should be fine."
jlcnuke1,"Sounds like you really have two budgets. An overview (what you present here) and a detailed one that let you come up with those numbers (otherwise you wouldn't know how much was going to recurring monthly expenses and personal spending for instance).  


Either way, as long as you know where your money is going, and are happy with where it's going, I think any budgeting style is perfectly acceptable.  


I do my budget like this:  
(A) Income - (B) mandatory bills (first spending... gotta keep the roof overhead) - (C) desired savings/investments (don't want to not have a roof overhead in retirement) = (D) available for spending.   
If I end the month with money from (D) left over, then I'll add that to additional savings/investments. I then track what I spend the money on so I can see if there's something I'm spending a bunch of money on which I don't really care about (like that HBO subscription on Amazon ya get just to catch up on GoT and forget to cancel when you've caught up and are no longer watching HBO)."
jlcnuke1,"For strictly taxable brokerage account, I prefer TD Ameritrade for their trading platforms and interface.  


For ease of use, I like TD Ameritrades interface much better for most things, but it sucks for trying to do backdoor Roth transactions. For that reason, I have my IRA's at Vanguard and my taxable account and HSA at TD Ameritrade.

Rustychipmunk,"Roth vs Traditional 401k I previously did all of my 401k as traditional to lower my MAGI and more easily do a Roth IRA. I'll be over the income limit regardless this year, so I was thinking I may do mostly Roth 401k. If I don't need the tax break now, is Roth the best option, or is there anything else I may be missing?"
Rustychipmunk,"Thanks for the insight! Agreed on your general thoughts. I'd like to diversify but maybe not make a complete change. I do think that since we're taxed at historical lows, there's a good chance of increased tax rates in the future, so it may be a good time to increase Roth contributions as a percentage of overall retirement.

Rustychipmunk,"Job seekers - don't ghost someone you reached out to on LinkedIn  A lot of posts on this sub are related to job seeking, raises, etc - so I thought this would be good to say.

  
Over the past months, 2 different LinkedIn contacts (i.e. strangers) have reached out to me to see if I could help them get a job at my company. Both started off good - they mentioned a specific position, were polite, etc. However, when I responded with ""Sure, I can submit you as a networking lead through our recruiting system which will get your resume in front of a recruiter faster"" I was met with no response both times. Maybe it was because I requested a resume, which is required to submit through our system (and seems pretty bare minimum info to me), or maybe they were looking for a ""you're hired"". Either way, guess what I will do next time someone reaches out through LinkedIn? Nothing.

Rustychipmunk,"Ways I saved money today:

1) change car insurance when your policy is up. Saved $47 and got better coverage 

2) credit cards - my Amazon Prime card has a 5% back deal on things like insurance, tv/cable bill,utilities, etc through April. Saved $20 on my insurance above and $5 on my cable bill

3) groupon was mentioned, but wanted to reiterate. We've gotten great deals here and also use ""shop through chase"" for 4-5% extra back. There are often 20% off coupons too. Got a $30 meal for $15 + $1.50 cash back

4) open a checking account with a bonus. Usually requires something like a direct deposit or two, but can yield $100-$300 for 10 minutes of work. Key bank has a good one that is $300-$400, just beware you'll pay tax on it  "
Rustychipmunk,"Pet Insurance - Which Provider? I know one of the first things when there is a post about pet insurance is that ""self insurance is better, pet insurance is usually not worth it."" I totally get that, but have decided to move forwards anyways for the following reasons:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Our dog is basically our child and we would not hesitate to drop $10-20k to save/cure him. 
2. We take our dog to work every day which means that he would be more susceptible to illness / injury with many other dogs around. 
3. $30 / month is not an issue with our budget - especially with vet prices in HCOL
4. Several people in my life had had huge vet bills recently due to sickness / injury. I know it's not necessarily a sound financial one, but an emotional one I am willing to live with
5. We took our dog to the vet yesterday and he does not have any current issues that would lead to pre-existing condition exclusion. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways - the advice I am looking for is on providers. The two I have done the most research on is Embrace and Healthy Paws. Currently I am leaning towards Healthy Paws because they have unlimited reimbursement, which I am really trying to protect against. Embrace does have dental coverage, but with a $1k max annual benefit.

&amp;#x200B;

Does Healthy Paws make the most sense, or is there another company that you would recommend? How important is dental coverage? (FYI - Havanese, male,1.5 years old, neutered) 

&amp;#x200B;

**Healthy Paws**

Pros

1. \~$30 / month
2. 90% reimbursement / $500 annual deductible
3. Unlimited reimbursement limit 

Cons

1. $25 account creation fee
2. Dental coverage, except trauma, appears to be excluded

&amp;#x200B;

**Embrace**

Pros

1. \~$32 / month
2. 80% reimbursement / $500 annual deductible. Option to increase deductible to $1k and make monthly cheaper
3. Includes dental coverage

Cons

1. $15k annual cap, which is probably fine is 95% of cases
2. No prescription coverage"
Rustychipmunk,"I think you misread - at my company, you can submit either a referral or a networking lead. I am obviously not going to take responsibility for referring someone I don't know (even though there is a bonus associated), but the networking lead still gets them more visibility than just applying blindly.

nomnomnompizza,"Make sure you have a high yield savings account with a bank like Ally or Discover. You'll earn 2.1% interest a year on it.

You have way too much money sitting doing nothing. Open a Roth IRA on Vanguard. Put $6,000 in (max for the year). On January 1st do the same if you have the money, or do a little bit over time.

Do your employer offer a 401k?

It's not the best idea financially, but buying a $35k car never is for someone making even $70k a year. Saving $1,500 a year on gas helps.

You should be maxing your 401k and IRA. Take advantage while you don't have to pay rent.

Edit - To be clear I think you should go for it"
nomnomnompizza,"This happened to me. It was cheaper for us to stay on separate plans. Luckily we both have decent options for single employee coverage. I think we'd pay a couple hundred bucks more if we both maxed out our deductibles, but that gets cancelled out by her job contributing $500 to an HSA that she otherwise wouldn't receive so it works out better to stay separate."
nomnomnompizza,"I wouldn't pick up and drop off. Too much risk these days of being accused of anything, or just getting in a normal wreck and being on the hook for any of that mess.

I'd tell dad to meet you at the bowling alley. Then I'd personally be fine accepting $40/hr of lessons + dad pays for the hour of lane use. Dedicate the first 30 minutes to whatever you need to teach him. Then the last 30 playing one on one games with him. Getting paid to bowl."
nomnomnompizza,Do they have more experience than you? Have they been with the company longer? A lot of factors can go into this. If you are 23 and in your first year don't expect to make the same as someone who is 35 and been at the company for 10 years.
nomnomnompizza,"Thousands of dollars a year is being added to your total balance via the high interest per year.

Why not pay it off now while you only have a few hundred bucks in bills versus when you are paying California prices on everything?

If you are going to be making a lot more after moving you still don't have a good reason to not pay 2x the minimum at least."
nomnomnompizza,"That is why saving a flat percentage is a poor way of looking at it. If the cost of living is equal he would be able to contribute the same amount to his 401k.

Now if both companies offer a 6% match or something he'd be getting a lot more that way."
nomnomnompizza,"Call and see if there is a card that you can downgrade too that is free. Then just don't use it if other cards give better rewards.

Closing your oldest card will hurt your age of credit and your score. Keep all your fee-free cards open."
nomnomnompizza,"Roth IRA on Vanguard.

Even if your next job has a 401k it doesn't really have an affect the IRA. They might have a 401k with really shitty fund options, and the optimal choice might be to stick with an IRA.

So contribute to a Roth IRA now and see what happens later."
nomnomnompizza,"There are very few reasons not to pay every bill with a credit card if the company billing you allows it. I'd imagine most do. You probably can't with your rent/mortgage, but things like your electric, water, etc etc.

Not sure why you were down voted. This is pretty standard."
JamesPerrenoud,"I didn’t proceed with the purchase so I don’t know how accurate my predictions would have been. But I included every expense and income/benefit I could think of.

I included all projected expenses such as taxes, etc but also maintenance (I think 20% of annual rental income), as well as fees associated with selling the property (which at 6% really cut into profits). 

For income I estimated rental income, depreciation and tax benefits (deduction of interest and taxes) as well as the fact that profits could avoid capital gains if structured properly (live in the condo for 2 years and make it your personal residence before selling).

Instead of buying a rental I purchased a single family home I now live in and am “fixing up” to sell for a profit in 3-5 years. I’m hoping that with this one I can secure a 50K net gain."
JamesPerrenoud,"My Previous accountant and I had a miscommunication and a $140,000 loss was not included on my taxes. It was only after I reviewed it that I noticed it. So I second your recommendation for becoming aware generally about taxes and your own personal situation."
JamesPerrenoud,Agree. I have money from my paycheck automatically deducted and sent to an account that’s difficult to access. I don’t miss the money from my paycheck and am less tempted to use it because it requires multiple transfers to another account before I can access it.
JamesPerrenoud,"Building on this, it will cost twice as much to sell the 400K home than the 200K home. A 6% realtor fee is 24K on the 400K home and 12K on the 200K home (fee rate may vary, but you get the point).

That being said, the opportunity for gain is bigger with the large value house, a 10% increase being 40K vs 20K. "
JamesPerrenoud,If you were in the US I’d recommend investing it in a S&amp;P500 index fund and not touching it for 40 years. If it grows at 7% you’ll end up with about $325K when you need it most towards the end of your working life.
JamesPerrenoud,"I pay my advisor what seems to be a lot of money (6K year) but his advice on a range of financial matters (taxes, real estate, benchmarking) are very helpful. His customer service is always excellent. 

He also stops me from making dumb decisions (pulling out of the market on a drop, being enamored with a stock I read about online).

But he is my fourth advisor in 20 years as previous ones were less helpful and responsive. I know this isn’t a popular view on this sub, but I think a good advisor is well worth the cost.

Maybe shop around, ask for referrals to other advisors if you’re not getting what you want/need?"
FITeacher,"You need to do your research before you go, so you know what the fair price is.  It is generally 10-20% under what the dealer is selling the car for.

I bought a Honda Odyssey, 2013 a few months ago from a Honda dealer with ""no haggle pricing.""

I knew the kind of car I wanted, and I had test driven some elsewhere, and they had three to choose from that I also test drove while I was there.

I picked out the one I wanted.  I said, I am buying a car today.  I hope it will be here.  What can we do about the price of this car?

They said, this car is 17.  That's our price, we don't haggle.

I said, great!  I don't haggle either.  My price is 13.

I said 13 seems fair.  I brought print outs of similar milage cars from other dealers (including other Honda dealers) within a 50 mile radius that had lower prices.

They said, we don't price match.

I said, that's fine, I am buying a car today.  I'd like to buy it from you, but I don't love you guys enough to pay you more than some other dealership.  Let's see how much wiggle room there is in your price.

They called the sales manager over who said, you have to understand, these Honda vans really hold their value.

I said, great!  Happy to hear it!  I am trading in a Honda van!

It took about four hours of me sitting there, and calls to the sales manager and three people coming over as a team to pressure me.

I asked if they could give me directions to the other dealerships, or call to verify the van they had was still in stock before I drove over there to buy it.

Finally, I paid the price that I wanted for the car, 13,500.  They asked if I wanted to finance, but I paid with a 1.5% cash back credit card which got me another couple hundred bucks off.

Now, on paper I paid their ""No haggle"" 17K price for the car, but the way they did it is by giving me three times what my trade in was worth.  It was worth less than 1000 (It had over 230K miles) and they gave me 3500 for it.

I just sat there and grinned and drank a bunch of their shitty coffee until I left with the car I wanted at a price I thought was fair.

I mean, their job is to sell cars, and they sit there all day doing it, so if you will sit there all day too, you can get a deal.

Just be firm and friendly and positive and remember it's your money, and you can always take it somewhere else."
FITeacher,"Should I sell stock to front load my IRA for the year? Should I sell stock to front load my IRA for the year, or put money in as I get it over the course of the year?

I'll pay taxes to sell the stocks, of course.

Thanks!"
FITeacher,"What if I contributed to a Roth but my AGI was above the cap? Let's say I contributed to a Roth, but it turned out I wasn't eligible to do so because my AGI was above the cap.  

Since a Roth deduction isn't reported on my taxes, how will this be discovered?   
What will happen to that money that I wasn't eligible to contribute?  


&amp;#x200B;"
FITeacher,"Also, depending on the state, if one partner files itemized, the other MUST.  Three years after my divorce, my state came after me for money because I filed the standard deduction and she filed itemized.  I had to refile and pay penalties.  It is best to check with your state if they have this rule."
FITeacher,"An interesting moral consideration.

&amp;#x200B;

Considering that I saved enough for them to go to college in the first place when I was under no obligation to do so, I am not sure it is as shitty as you claim for me to try and use a student loan in their name as money for investment.

If the stock market goes up, I'd have some money to give them when they graduate.

If it goes down, I could always use some of the money I have saved for their college or money of my own to make up the difference."
FITeacher,"Can your mom inherit the pension?  Depending on how it is set up, that is possible.  I am not sure what you mean by ""A Pension worth 250K.""  It is an annuity?  It is pre-tax or post tax?  Pensions can be good when they are inflation adjusted.  Otherwise, there may be little difference between that and a lump sum.  "
FITeacher,"Thanks.  I am divorced with three kids with 50.50 custody and residency, but I pay more for their care (about 15K more in 2018) and claim all three kids.    


Every year my ex threatens to claim them, saying it's not fair I claim them every year.  Every year I say, It's not fair I should pay far more for their care and that you should get the tax benefits.  Care to meet me in the middle with these college expenses?    


She always says no.  Wouldn't surprise me if I find out one year how the IRS will resolve situations like these.

&amp;#x200B;"
FITeacher,"Thanks for raising these points.

To your point about the interest, there is no interest while my kid is in school, then low interest thereafter.  

&amp;#x200B;

""Would I borrow to invest?""

I have a 30 year mortgage on my house which I could afford to pay off, so that essentially is borrowing to invest, isn't it?

As I said before, if I can pay for my kids college fund, who is to know if I paid for that out of pocket or if I used the money from a loan.

The point you raised about cap in lending is interesting, but I am not sure how it is relevant.  It is 31K per child, I think.

If I can invest 5k or 10k or 30k interest free for my kid, that seems like risk I could take.

Thanks for bringing these points up."
FITeacher,"When do dependent kids need to file taxes? My two kids babysat last year.  They are minor dependents.

We are in the US.

One made 800 and one made 1200.  I want to put that money in a Roth IRA for them.

Do I need to file taxes for them?"
OriginalATX,How much are those cars in NJ?? IDK about the different trims but i did a quick search on cargurus and the prices dont seem that much different. Cant imagine it was worth taking a plane and putting miles/wear and tear/gas.
OriginalATX,"Its never too late. You are just at CC..most of the classes are core classes (or should be) and easily transferable to other colleges. Its once you transfer, then you start taking the major specific classes. I would say. How sure are you that you are going to finish pre med? I think theres a lot of pre med students who dont really finish or end up changing their degrees..

"
OriginalATX,"Either way, you end up paying the same amount. If you get a refund, that means your checks were less than what they should have been and you were letting the government use your money for free. If you owe money, then your checks were bigger than what they should have been and you have to pay it back...you COULD/SHOULD do it this way, to invest that money or use it to pay down debts(rather than paying the extra interest).

Whether you owe 4k or get a refund of 4k, you gonna be paying the same amt.

Some people who get a few hundred in refund may prefer that bc other wise that extra money they would be paid extra each month may not be properly utilized. "
OriginalATX,"This is pretty common but really dependent on the ISP. Most offer a promo rate for a year or so and then jack up the prices to ""normal"" rates. You can call and threaten to cancel or try and reduce the bill. But for example Spectrum told me I have to stop being a customer for 1 month before getting a promo offer again. Another option is to go with another ISP...but some places only have 1 provider for their home so its up to the ISP if they want to reduce your bill or just let you cancel."
OriginalATX,"What car? Makers differ a lot. Some will offer tons of rebates and Honda does not offer any rebates.

Use truecar to find market value...check 2019's as well. If the prices arent too different it may be worth getting the 2019 (especially if you have good credit and qualify for promo rates) if its much better. Again the prices differ between makers. Dont buy Dodge/Jeep/Fiat/Chrystler they are crap. Nissan is like the asian version of those brands..stay away.

I would lean towards Honda/Toyota..if you live in colder climates, you may want to lean towards toyota.

Anyway, Use truecar to get an idea of what you should be paying in your specific market.

If you have costco, use costco auto to get a price quote.

With your costco price as your main source, see how it compares on the trucar scale. Negotiate for the best price and use your costco price as your primary quote. If you dot have costco, use the truecar scale and aim for the ""exceptional"" value price.

Go to dealerships in the area or email them, see if they will be able to beat the price.

Always go with someone that can keep you form making a quick decision.
Also, you can negotiate for extras as well. Weathermats/mudguards/tint/etc...all of these are low cost to the dealership.

So if a place cant beat or come close to the price, maybe they will throw in free tint/mats/etc so the value matches and you end up getting these things thrown in.

"
OriginalATX,"You have 2.3k in expenses with a 140k income but are planning only having 10k each in savings and are really under funded in retirement.

In any case, the 35k should should probably go to retirement. 12k for yalls IRA. Then max out your contributions each month and live off the remaining  23k.

Retirement contribution should be 15-20%..clsoer to 20% since you have Low COL and high income/no debt. 

Open savings acct for emergency fund in a HYSA"
OriginalATX,"I dont think you gave any relevant info.
Income/expenses/debt.

Id consider a used honda/toyota/scion for ~10k or less. It will be pretty reliable. And the difference between that cost and the cost of leasing probably wouldnt be THAT much...and you can resale if you need to and recoup some of the money."
OriginalATX,"It doesnt matter what the possible fees may or may not be. Maybe calc your new hourly rate and gauge an estimated amt of OT you have needed to work. and factor that in to get a better idea. But theyre already paying you  around the avg salary and it can vary widely depending on ur position, how much you can negotiate."
OriginalATX,"The avg rent is the highest in the state :/

Im not sure about rent rates know but it seems to have cooled a bit, but in the past few years had previously increased pretty high each year.

Another reason I want to avoid renting is having to deal with increasing rent and moving costs possibly each year."
OriginalATX,"Open a new one and start there..im assuming no company match since you are a teacher.

You can max out up to 6k/yr.that way you wont have to deal with any extra fees.

Use schwab or vanguard...schwab has a $100 generic referral code you can use as well if you do a google search for it."
OriginalATX,"CS jobs dont even require a degree..you just need to be able to demonstrate you know your skills.

Thats why theres a bunch of tech bootcamps that have popped up.

Go to community college for 2 years then transfer to a state school for CS. "
OriginalATX,"No tax expert but unless there is some documentation, then theres not much that can be done...otherwise people would be claiming all kinds of personal charitable situations. However, if there is documentation provided by the church regarding this(they usually provide documents for tithes) then she would be able to claim that."
OriginalATX,"What happens to that money if its never needed? If your child gets a scholarship to pay for it, or if tuition becomes free (some CC colleges are experimenting with free tuition).

But in any case, CC+State school is a cheapo route and doesn't require THAT much money."
OriginalATX,"Well, you dont know what you will get for trade in. You could get less than 11k.

Whatever you do, dont tell the dealership you have a trade in until you have a set price for the vehicle you are going to buy"
bro_mo_sapien,"Obviously I would love to pay cash. But I think to be able to do that in the time frame I am wanting to I would have to really sacrifice what we put towards student loans every month. Some of the loans are as low as 3%, about $3K of it is 6%. I would definitely knock out anything &gt;5% before I upgraded vehicles, as that is about where I would expect my APR to be. "
bro_mo_sapien,"I appreciate the advice, definitely something I will look into. I know she likes Corollas. I am definitely guilty of thinking bigger= safer, so it was primarily me pushing for a mid-size SUV. She preferred the Rav4 over the CRV so that is why I narrowed in my focus on these. I guess it is time to expand the search. "
bro_mo_sapien,"I appreciate the input. We would definitely only have the one car payment if we chose to upgrade. The 20/4/10 car rule gets thrown around here pretty often and we would meet all of those criteria, I guess I just really hate the idea of debt, so the thought of adding more to a $36K tab is scary to me. "
bro_mo_sapien,I'm not a car aficionado but I think a big part of it is because it is a Toyota. They hold value well and what I've been reading says with normal maintenance and a few regular repairs those things can run 250K miles. It is priced below KBB and it is competitively priced to others within a 200 mile radius of me. 
bro_mo_sapien,"I guess maybe I was wrong but I saw it as pointless to buy her a different car now, if we would probably then need to upgrade to something bigger in 3-5 years. I thought it would make more sense to buy it now, financing this one over 36-48 months, and plan to have it paid off by that time. But shit happens and we could have a kid in 10 months or never. "
bro_mo_sapien,"Appreciate the advice. I'm not counting on getting much for the car, even selling it private party. We may look into driving it until we can boost that savings to a point where we can pay ~$8K cash and still have our 6 mo emergency fund. "
bro_mo_sapien,"Thanks. Yes, the plan was to finance it over either 36 or 48 months. We are trying to get the student loans wiped out before kids come into the picture so we have been more closely monitoring our expenses. Getting a raise and then immediately taking on more debt, regardless of how much, seemed like creep to me. "
bro_mo_sapien,"It is below KBB for the car. I know some people say KBB is useless, but it is also priced better than other Rav 4s of comparable year with comparable miles. I don't think they are far off on the price, I was just deciding whether or not it fit in the budget. I'd love to find a new car for near 13K but haven't found any yet. "
bro_mo_sapien,"I like that your opinion is different from the same old boring shit I always hear on here. ""Buy a 2003 Camry for $2,000 cash and drive it for 12 years."" 


However I just don't think spending $20-$30K on a car is in our best interest right now. "
bro_mo_sapien,"I actually did look into Foresters. Except I was looking at 4-5 year old models with ~80-100K miles. Apparently head gasket issues around that time is very common and can be a costly repair. She would be the primary driver, but since my car is old this potential new vehicle would be what we drive on the weekends or when we go out somewhere together. I'm 6'1"" so tall, but not Gigantor. Me fitting comfortably is a consideration, but not really a priority. "
bro_mo_sapien,Yea this post definitely made me realize I need to put aside my preconceived notions of SUVs being safer and expand my options. Hopefully once I start looking into sedans I will find something closer to what you are talking about. 
bro_mo_sapien,"Everyone I know that drives a Camry loves it. I have definitely decided I need to expand my search to include more Sedans. I came into this search with the mindset that I needed a mid-size SUV for safety, but am realizing that is not my only option. Thanks!"
bro_mo_sapien,I see your point. Used Toyotas are always tricky because they hold their value so well you can get a new one for a few grand more than what is usually being asked for a used one. In this case I was looking for 2013 or newer with less than 120K. Within a 200 mile radius of me everything I was finding was within $1-2K and roughly the same miles. New ones are like $30K. 
bro_mo_sapien,"Income jumped, needing a different car but want to avoid lifestyle creep. I'll try and exclude everything but the necessary info. Fiance and I both start new jobs this month. Annual combined gross pay is going from about $60K in 2018 to $110K in 2019. I have the nicer car of the two of us and drive a '04, she drives a '99. Both have ~150K miles and (knock on wood) no current issues, however it seems like every other month hers needs some sort of repair. 


My main concern is the safety of her car. It is old, rusty, and small (Corolla). She is now going to be commuting everyday. Kids are also on the 3-5 year plan so a safe, mid-size SUV was what we had in mind. Found a 2013 Rav 4 with 105K miles for $13K.


* Monthly expenses as of January total $2,500 (excluding potential new vehicle)


* Total current debt is $36,000 in SL between 3-6% (her $28K me $8K) 


* I have been aggressively paying off SL ($20K in 2 years) so we only have about $8K in savings between us. 


Do you think we could add this expense without being stretched too thin or would you recommend finding something else safe + cheap for &lt;$10,000? 


Thanks!"
bro_mo_sapien,Yea I have noticed there seems to be a premium on the crossovers even though they really aren't much more spacious and usually less fuel efficient. Maybe it is a bunch of people like me who assumed they are safer just because they are bigger?
ParsimoniousFrontier,"&gt;They nearly withheld all of them against my will until 25, but luckily decided to follow my dad’s will which says I should be given it at 18.

'They' (presuming one of your sisters is executor of the will) can't do anything but follow the direction of the will/trust documents (legally speaking).

I would try to figure out who drew up the documents, presuming it was a trust/estate lawyer, and meet with this person to get a better understanding of your inheritance.  Depending on the details, this person (lawyer) might be interested to hear about your sister's behavior.  Some (? most) trust documents have a provision to replace an executor that is not upholding their responsibilities.  If nothing else, you will get guidance, help formalizing any concerns, and demonstrate your willingness/ability to be kept up-to-date henceforth.

If dad really did leave you enough money for college, you should not (and will not) qualify for aid.  In either case, spend wisely.



   "
ParsimoniousFrontier,"A company does not have an 'IRA' (Individual Retirement Account).

A company may have a 401(k).  A non-profit may have a 403(b).  There are other types of company retirement plans, but these are not referred to as an 'IRA.'  An IRA is typically something you (the individual) open to save for retirement.

Assuming you are referring to a company's 401(k) plan:

Eligibility date:  There is usually a waiting period, outlined in the plan documents, before you can begin participating in a 401(k).

Once eligible, you can contribute whatever percent of your salary you choose pre-tax or post-tax, the later being known as a 'Roth 401(k).'

Applicable limits: For 2019, one can contribute up to $19,000 if below age 50.  If above age 50, you can add an additional $6000 (totaling $25,000) in 'catch up' contributions.

Investment funds: most employers choose an investment company (Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab) to administer their plan.  The menu of fund choices will be decided, typically by a committee or employer, based on what's available from that investment company or with guidance from that investment company.  You then choose from the menu of investment options to create your desired portfolio.

Rollovers: if you have money in an IRA or other 401(k), 403(b) outside of this plan (all these are known as 'qualified' retirement vehicles) you can 'roll over' (or transfer) those funds into your new 401(k).

Safe Harbor plan: A safe harbor plan is set up by a company when it wants to avoid the nondiscrimination test.  In short, the company agrees to give each employee a certain 'match' so if there is a difference in the amount various employees (e.g. those that are highly paid versus those that are not) are contributing, the company does not get in trouble with the IRS.  This sounds complicated, but basically the IRS says ALL employees should be able to take advantage of these retirement vehicles, not just the executives (of any company) using them to avoid taxes while us plebs slog away unable to contribute due to low wages.

Profit Share: the company takes excess revenue (profit) each year and makes it available as a 'bonus' contribution to your 401(k) above and beyond your contributions and the match (up to $55,000 total).

I hope that helps.

ParsimoniousFrontier,"This is not an answer to your post, but a thought about your apathy towards investment/money.  Have you read 'Your Money or Your Life?'

https://www.amazon.com/Your-Money-Life-Transforming-Relationship/dp/0143115766/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1548604642&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=your+money+or+your+life+2018+edition

When you say you don't care about money, do you plan to work forever?  All those hard earned dollars in savings represent hours of toil.  They deserve just as much effort from you to grow into something that can sustain you in hardship, disability, or retirement as you put into acquiring them in the first place.

Just a thought.

ParsimoniousFrontier,"If you continue to spend 170K annually in retirement, you will need 25 x that amount: 25 x 170,000 = 4.25 million to continue spending without (modest) fear of running out of money when you quit working.

You have about 500K in assets listed above.

If your goal is 4.5 million in 20 years (minus the 500k you already have), you need to save at least 125k (maybe more) annually to reach your goal.  This assumes 5% return in a mostly taxable account.  If you can't save this amount, you need to cut back expenses or make more money.

Good luck!
"
ParsimoniousFrontier,"I agree there is overlap with SCHD.

You may know this already, but for others, the classic 'tilt' is to SMALL CAP VALUE (not mid- or large-cap value).  This has been popularized recently as part of 'factor' investing. Small Cap Value is one of several 'factors' that some believe give an edge (in performance) to a portfolio.  Whether this is 'past performance does not equal future performance' or real, well, who knows.  

https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2018/02/01/factor-investing-gains-popularity

In summary, your second most expensive fund (SCHD, ER 0.07) is probably extraneous...."
ParsimoniousFrontier,"I Agree.  For relatively certain future expenditures (especially large expenditures) you do not want much risk, unless your time horizon is 10+ years.  In order of safety/preservation of principal:

- High yield savings account

- CD ladder

- Money Market Fund

- Short term bond fund

Keep saving!"
ParsimoniousFrontier,"A good goal is 15% of your gross income for retirement.  I'd recommend bumping up your savings a little.  

Make it a goal to add a percent a year from your gross revenue to retirement until it hurts.  How far can you go?  20%, 25%, 30%?!

You make good money but won't be able to live at the same level in retirement if you don't start to save more now.  Like a lot of healthcare providers, you got started late.  This is the devil in the details for those that look at the salary of healthcare professionals with envy.  Often, they are not starting contributions until their 30s, while that 29 year old engineer has been saving for 7 years and has a 250k jump start!

Good luck!

"
ParsimoniousFrontier,"Think of investing as a risk/reward continuum:

low risk (low reward) &lt;-------------------------------&gt; high risk (high reward)

A rental property (among other focused capital investment) carries a large risk component.  You should be rewarded for that risk with higher return.

A diversified 'Bogle-style' index has a mix of assets that should be less risky over time, thus would be expected to earn you less over time.

If you **think** (ideally after considering all the angles) that the rental property will end up returning a significantly higher amount over the next decade, stay put.  If it's even close to a wash, go with the diversified portfolio of funds.

Good luck!"
ParsimoniousFrontier,"The first question I would have is why do you want to do this?  

Are you saving for college?

There are 'smart' ways to save for college that might fit your situation (529, ESA, UMTA).  However, to put money in a non-protected savings account for the kids (or custodial account) without a goal does not really make sense.

The most important thing you can do for your kids is secure **your** financial future."
ParsimoniousFrontier,"You actually 'need' life insurance typically at a younger age.  If you die with kids, a mortgage, and not much in savings/assets, you **need** life insurance to help keep things from falling apart financially.

If you are a frequent reader of PF, by age 50 you should have a decent amount of retirement savings, house close to paid off, kids mostly grown.  So, the question of 'why' is not trivial here.  Why does she need life insurance?

"
ParsimoniousFrontier,"Neither, unless you can explain why it's a true emergency:  

&gt; maybe even have a little bit extra to knock out a few things like projects around the house

What?

I would recommend more discipline to pay off the debt.  Cut expenses.  Make it hurt.  If you take out a HELOC or 401(k) loan now, you are hamstringing your future and normalizing what (at least on PF) should be taboo.  

There should not be a time where either are a realistic option, unless it's a true emergency.
"
ParsimoniousFrontier,"I agree.  There are some details here but not enough to give us the full picture and provide you with actionable advice.  More reading is probably the best next step.

Here are some thoughts for OP:

1. save 15% (minimum) for retirement annually: 130K x .15 = 19.5K --&gt; save more if you can
2. Presumably, you both have 401(k) access, in which you can **each** contribute 19K annually (total 36K).  So, you have plenty of space here to save more if you are not maximizing your contribution(s).
3. The FAQ will give you some additional thoughts on whether to contribute to the max in your 401(k) (maybe you have good, low cost options therein) versus contributing to the 'match' and then moving your investing to an IRA.  Keep in mind there are income restrictions to get a deduction in your combined salary range, so this may be a worthwhile thought exercise.
4. Should you pay off your auto note?  Some say yes, some say no (it's a low interest rate, so it's probably fine to keep it and invest the cash above your emergency fund).

Ask more questions to get more detailed responses.

Good luck."
ParsimoniousFrontier,"I agree a HELOC is a common loan.  That does not make it a smart financial move in OP's case (or others).  

My only point was OP's 'emergency' sounded like a smoke-and-mirrors attempt to justify tapping equity (401k or home) and taking on more debt.

Debt should be avoided, unless it can be justified.  Here's my perspective:

Home loan --&gt; okay as long as it is not for a house you really can't afford ('house poor').

HELOC --&gt; maybe.  Just maybe if you are 'house poor,' have significant equity, and encounter a situation that demands you take on more debt.

Student Loans --&gt; maybe.  Only if your degree will (likely) get you a job that can easily pay off the debt in the future.

Car loan --&gt; ideally no.  Only if you need it to get to work and it's not eating up much of your income does this make sense.

Other revolving debt (credit cards, etc.) --&gt; pay it off ASAP.  Don't take it on in the future.

Payday loans --&gt; you are in real trouble here.

Loan shark --&gt;  the ship is sinking and you are trying to stay on it as long as possible. "
ParsimoniousFrontier,"I am sorry for your loss.

The money is your sister's (legally).  I am making this point because many families are torn apart by poor estate planning/lack of planning.  Use this example as a reason to get your estate (will, power of attorney, last wishes, health care power of attorney) in order because you never know when **your** heirs may face a similar situation.

All your sister would need to say is, 'mom intended the money for me, she told me so' and you would have little recourse AND potentially spend a lot on lawyer's fees trying to sort it out (if you got anything).

My advice is to always split the estate equally among siblings when you designate secondary beneficiaries.  Primary beneficiaries are typically your spouse (if applicable).  

Check out Condon's Book: 'Beyond the Grave' for more detailed reading on the subject."
ParsimoniousFrontier,"There's not enough information here for anyone to give you a thoughtful response.

It seems like you are trying to justify a house expense beyond your means.  If you need to put 57% down to make the mortgage payment 'manageable' my guess is that you would not be able to live in this house without the inherited money.  The fact that your retirement accounts are not fully funded is another concern.

Are you about to become house poor?

Those 'favorites' aside, you might be interested in 'Your Money or Your Life.'  It gets you to think about the value of money in YOUR terms.  In short, you start to think about purchases in terms of hours of work you have to do to get there.  Want an $80 pair of shoes?  That's an 8 hour day of work at $10/hr, so consider carefully!

Good luck!"
ParsimoniousFrontier,"I generally agree one can use debt responsibly.  

I think the point we both would make is that those that can afford to pay cash for a car (or similar major purchase) generally have favorable credit, and thus get the loan that allows the sort of arbitrage you are describing.  

The point is the vast majority of individuals who finance a car can't simply pay cash for it.  In those cases, I hope my opinion makes them think twice.

Cheers!"
gazeebo88,"Employed or self employed?  
If employed, simple, it counts as income received in 2019 and thus will be on your 2019 W2.  
If self employed, it depends on your accounting method.  
Cash basis is when money is received/billed, accrual based is when something is billed.  
The overwhelming majority of self employed individuals are cash basis."
gazeebo88,"That's not right, the tuition was reimbursed by the employer so the taxpayer incurred no education cost.  
The 1098-t is to claim an education credit but only if you paid for it, you can not double dip and it will get you into a boat load of trouble if you are caught doing so."
gazeebo88,"I always get a little annoyed when people only think about CPA for tax situations.  
I get that some CPAs specialize in taxes, but if you really want a tax professional you should look for an EA (enrolled agent).  
They are the only federally licensed professionals that specialize in tax law.  


&gt;An enrolled agent (EA) is a federally-authorized tax practitioner who has technical expertise in the field of taxation and who is empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before all administrative levels—examination, collection, and appeals—of the Internal Revenue Service.


To answer your question, no.  
Any tax preparer worth their salt can help you out.  "
gazeebo88,"He says he was the property manager which would indicate some effort went into it.  
The 250 hours also do not have to be done by the taxpayer itself but can be outsourced and include a long list of items.    

He may or may not qualify for it, but such is the nature of preparing your own return.  "
gazeebo88,"What the employer did was right, but really should have informed you before hand on the tax implications so you could have made preparations.  
The tax system is ""pay-as-you-earn"", so whenever he was reimbursed you technically received income and you were supposed to send in some taxes to the IRS.  
If he was reimbursed through his pay check, the employer should have withheld taxes already (check on his paystubs if they did or didn't). But apparently even if they did, it wasn't sufficient.  
What the employer does not know is other sources of income, for example yours. So if his W4 doesn't reflect his household situation accurately, a tuition reimbursement like this can really mess you up come tax time."
gazeebo88,"True, he's got about $40,000 to his name before spending it on college and a car.  


Depending on how much he qualifies for in grants and scholarships that could save a good bit of money.  
/r/personalfinance is a bad place to ask about how much to spend on a car though."
gazeebo88,"I work for an Enrolled Agent and we would probably charge around $150 for a return based on what you're describing.  
Most of the things you're describing is as simple as filling in the numbers on the right form, the co-ownership of the rental would be a little bit more work but it's certainly not impossible.  

Don't forget about the new QBI deduction and accumulated depreciation!"
gazeebo88,"It is listed as taxable income due to the fact the employer reimbursed him for the education cost. It is technically the same as being paid a bonus and using that money to pay for education. The benefit to tuition reimbursement over a bonus is OP only pays federal taxes and no payroll taxes on it.  


This also allows the business to write off the education cost and OP only has to worry about the federal tax portion.  


The best educational credit caps out at $2500, so if they owe $9000  in taxes alone I can guarantee you his employer paid big money."
gazeebo88,"While the standard deduction went up from $6,350 in 2017 to $12,000 in 2018, you lost the personal exemption of $4,050.  


So using the standard options you had a deduction of $10,400 for 2017. In 2018 it's just the $12,000.  If you can't itemize over the $12,000 then that's all you get.     
You mention you itemized for about $9-10,000 last year so your total income deduction was about $13,050-$14,050.  
Again, the new standard deduction is a flat $12,000, no more exemptions, and that would explain why you have a smaller deduction for this year.  


"
gazeebo88,"No, that is not possible.  
Exempt status only applies if you had no tax liability in the prior year. Even then, if you generate income that produces a tax liability you still have to file a tax return and pay taxes on said money.  
Bottom line, if you're getting a bonus it is safe to assume you have income and more than likely a tax liability.  
Any bonus you receive will increase your taxable income. Not taking out taxes would be foolish and technically also ""illegal"" (i can't find the right word.. but its against tax regulations) as you may underpay be more than the minimum of 85% of your tax liability, causing you to have to pay an additional underpayment penalty on top of your tax liability.


You can not be exempt from social security and medicare unless you work for an organization that has alternatives set up (think certain government employees that have gov. funded pensions or ministerial employees)


Now... you can technically set yourself up for failure and have your employer take out 0 federal taxes.  
They shouldn't let you, but if they do it's just going to create problems.  


Source : I work on personal taxes and payroll services.


My personal advice, even though you don't want advice (which is kind of foolish..) : Don't be a fool. A bonus is extra money. Doesn't matter what they take out in taxes, you're going to get back any possible over payment anyway."
gazeebo88,"It's more of an annoyance since I work for an EA and the majority of people don't even know what an EA is because the term ""CPA"" has been so ingrained into peoples brains.  


There are plenty of CPAs out there who don't specialize in tax law and focus primarily on strictly business accounting, while every single EA is specialized in tax law.  
In fact we have an employee trying to get his CPA certification, does really good at business accounting and business taxes, but is only capable of basic personal tax returns because it's not what he chose to specialize in."
1234YouDontKnowMe,"You can want this all you want, but a bank won't allow it. They won't allow that mortgage to income ratio. Look closer to 1/3 of your income. That's your range. And if that price point puts you in an unsafe area, then it's seems you wont be buying. "
1234YouDontKnowMe,"I'm in the same boat. It always maxes out no higher than 805. I have no idea why. I've tried keeping very low balances and making minimum payments and that didn't help. It goes from 790 to 805, not higher.  But like others said... it effects nothing. "

1234YouDontKnowMe,"Are the costs that my health insurance policy pays counted ""against me"" by my employer? For example, last year my health insurance policy paid over $100k in claims for my family. This year, thanks to an appendix surgery, I just used another $50k or so. Now my daughter might need hospitalization again... another $100k potentially.  If it matters, I have an amazing policy and it's fully paid by my employer. 

Does my employer know it's actually me with these large claims? Or do they just get a sum of the costs of all claims?  My direct manager knows I used my policy extensively and I'm wondering if that makes me look bad as an employee. "
1234YouDontKnowMe,"Go to the IRS calculator online. Or paycheckcity.com  Put in your annual income including your bonus. See how much tax will be due on all of it.  Next, figure 22% of your bonus. Subtract that amount from your annual taxes you'll be liable for. Now you need to figure what to claim on your W4 to cover that amount. Use the websites above, or Google ""Pub 15 2019"" and utilize the tax tables and do the math manually. Good luck! "

SensitiveBugGirl,"How should we go about saving for and/or financing a newer SUV? Hi all, I hope you can give me some good ideas. I apologize for any errors. I worried so much that I didn't get much sleep last night. My husband and I are 25. We live in WI. My husband and father put a new muffler on our '94 Jeep yesterday. My dad (a car guy of 40+ years who knows the in and outs of many cars) noted that we are going to need a new car/SUV within a year. Our frame is rusting away and will soon affect the motor. We need an SUV because we have a pop-up and already need more space than our Jeep Grand Cherokee has.

What is the best way to go about saving for a newer SUV? I had never looked up the costs of new SUVs before and didn't realize that if you want a reliable one with under 100,000 miles, you would need to pay $9,000+. 

We have about $6,000 in our savings(in a high yield Marcus savings account). We expect to get $6,000+ from our tax refund(our way of saving.....please don't judge) according to past years and the online tax calculator I did with my husband's W2(and I am a stay at home mom). We contribute $545.24 a month to our HSA($272.62 every other week) and have $2,378 in there now. My husband contributes 8% to his 401k and 4% to his Roth 401k(he just opened that Roth one this month). His employer matches up to 5% on 10%.

Their plan is that we need to get a new one by November...9 months away. I was thinking about almost stopping our HSA contributions or a while unless we suddenly empty out the HSA for emergancy care and slowing down or stopping the contributions to his 401K. We contribute almost $10,900 in 9 months between those three things I figure. He wanted to learn more about taking a loan from his 401K. I was pretty sure that was a bad idea. 

Or we could finance in some way? We have good credit (he is about 755; I am 785 but don't have a job), but a few places have told him his credit history isn't long enough (he never went to college or had a car loan). What kind of rate might we get? What amount of downpayment would be best in our situation do you think?

This is a bit complicated by the fact that I have a private student loan of $10,235 at 4.81% and $28,241 in federal loans on an IBR plan. For the private loan, they require $215. I pay $316. I was planning on using $2000 of our tax refund to go towards a new vehicle and put the rest to my private student loan. I'm doing the avalanch method, and if I don't use more of our tax refund, it would be paid off in April of 2020(and them all around September of 2022). I would think that a car loan rate would be less than the 4.81%???

I'm sorry for the long post, but I wanted to give a good picture of our options. What do you think would be a good plan for saving for a SUV while hopefully not sabataging my loan repayment plans? I would be happy to answer any other questions. Please go easy on me! This is our first time buying a vehicle. My parents were kind enough to gift us the two ones we have now. 
"
SensitiveBugGirl,"In case of an emergency. I used to drive a little when I had a part time job. It was a wedding present. No, it needs a lot of work. I do plan on getting a job at some point in the near future. 

I've tried talking to him. I don't know what else to say about that. He tells me to get a job then. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"So you think using the whole refund for a car is better than cutting my loan in half and slowing down or halting the contributions to pay for the vehicle? 

I agree with the private sales I think. We were just looking at the overal prices. My dad is good friends with a used car dealer nearby so that might work out okay too. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"You can probably set up a payment plan. Call them(the physicians group and later once you receive the bill, the hospital) and see. 

Before we built up our HSA, I created payment plans for everything. We also have a high deductible plan. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"So then I should still put most of the refund to my loan for this year? We are doing our taxes in a couple weeks. 

Yeah, I will try one of their calculators. My husband has his set at 1 I know. How do I then figure out how much extra we will be getting and how much extra I can put to my loan?"
SensitiveBugGirl,"Only if the doctors appointment/presciption that gave you the bills were after opening the account. In the OPs case, I'm pretty sure they can't use the funds to pay the medical bills because they went to the doctor 5 days to a couple weeks before opening the account. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"My mom didn't think what we spend on food was too terrible. Getting the meat processed isn't cheap. We don't buy stuff like steaks. We do have Aldis. I've never liked their selection. We could try there again I guess.

I looked at our Meijers bill. They changed things so the gas station looks like their store on the bill. The last time they separated the two was September. My husband spent $220 on gas that month. Not unusual. And I don't drive(so that is a no to the part time job in the near future). I have anxiety that needs to be dealt with first. I definitely can't do a job that involves delivery. Our other car needs major fixing before I can use it too. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"Not really. We are all paid up. And after the deductible is met, they pay 90%. I figure if we used a good chunk within 9 months, we could start it back up again. Go on a payment plan if necessary. 

What about cutting the person of 401k by a little bit or should we not touch it at all? He isn't sure exactly how they match if he has both a 401k and a roth 401k. 

Edit: how much would you personally set aside for an SUV? I'm trying to see how much of our refund we should set aside. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"Recommendation for a place to put our savings? Hi all! I'm wondering what you recommend for a savings account? I'm getting sick of Chase's .01% interest rate and getting less than 75 cents a year. My plan is to is to keep about $500 in the Chase account(the minimum plus a couple hundred extra) in case we need a little extra. It's easier to transfer between Chase accounts. I want to put the rest ($5,655) with a company that has a better interest rate. Who do you recommend in terms of interest rate and/or customer service/overall experience? From my research, Ally, Discover, and American Express have good rates? My only experience is with Chase so I don't know if one of these three are better than the others or not. 

Thanks! "
SensitiveBugGirl,"I edited it. Usually we seem to have about $400 leftover after the Meijers credit card for two weeks for restaurants and other things not from Meijers. We also hunt, and my husband has an irritating habit of buying stuff online related to hunting and archery. He says it's his reward for working so hard. Last year added up to nearly $1,500 with them building a tree stand and stuff according to Personal Capital. I started to try to separate his hobbies from mine for their budgeting section. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"Not too much longer if we want her to go to preschool. 

The preschool at the gradeschool I attended is almost as much as our rent is each month. We sure can't afford another $760 a month. I'm not 100% sure how that compares to other places nearby. 

It was never our intention for me to be a SAHM. I was fired from my part time job when our daughter was 6 months old. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"I honestly considered making buttered noodles for 9 months if that meant we could save a lot of money. 
I've tried talking to my husband about buying online, but as I noted, he feels he needs a reward for working so hard. Can't say I blame him. 

That's also why I threw in that I did an online tax calculator with his W2s and our deductionsas well. I've asked some people(not on here) if that is semi reliable. No one answered me. 

As I put in another comment, I'm worried we wouldn't withhold enough and I would put too much to my student loans. I definitely see where you guys are coming from though. I wish someone could say here...put your deductions at _____ and put an extra ____ to your loans each month. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"Our income is around $3,800 give or take several hundred. It can be as low as $3,000. His pay varies week to week. He works in a warehouse. 

Per month, we pay

* $52.80 for internet
* $98.03 for my federal loans(soon to go up. I don't have the new amount yet)
* $154.64 for cell phones
* $790 for rent
* $14.77 for Netflix
* $84 total for both of our life insurances
* $316 for private student loan
* $99.24 for car insurance for 2 cars(soon to go up a little. We are in the process of getting renters insurance that will be bundled)
* $70 for my husband's 0% APR credit card(he doesn't use it and we are paying it down before the promotional period ends)
* about $100 for utilities
* $13ish for Amazon Prime(We still don't know if we will keep it. My husband bought a firestick and accidently signed up again). 
* We spend about $850 a month at Meijers for gas, food, and necessities. We pay the credit card off every month. 
* We go out to eat more than we should. Usually a $200-300. Yes, we will work on lowering this. 
* $16.67 for Ancestry.com
* $100 goes to our savings each month
* $20 goes towards our toddler's savings. 

That total comes to $3,079.15 including what we are saving.

Yes, I know he will go with us, but I'm going to assume we will still need way more than we currently have and will have if we keep things as is. 

I will try to reformat this in a couple minutes. My toddler needs me for something.  
"
SensitiveBugGirl,"I guess I wasn't exactly looking to cut down on expences because I thought we were doing okay. Our net worth is growing with every paycheck. I was wondering if stopping or slowing down our HSA and 401k contributions was a viable option or if we should use our refund and do a tiny bit of financing instead of paying down my loan. 

I felt pretty good after finding out that my husband's pay with working in warehouse and not going to college wasn't that much less than his cousin who is 5 years older than us and went to an engineering school. We put $10,000 a year on my student loans. He had to be paying the minimum on average. We don't live in a fancy apartment like he does. We don't buy brand new cars every year like he does. We don't go to the Carribean each year like he does. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"Because my loan has a higher interest rate? That's where I was coming from. 

We both looked online, and the $10,000 SUVs still had like 130,000 miles on them. Or if they were cheaper, they are known to have major issues like the 2004(and surrounding years) Equinox's. We were looking at Transverses and Arcadias. My dad doesn't have anything against them. 

Yes, I didn't want to take from our savings either, which is why I am considering halting our HSA and 401k contributions instead. 

I am considering having him change it, but I am worried I'd put too much to my student loans and then at the end of the year have to pay thousands because we didn't withhold enough. 
"
SensitiveBugGirl,"No, my mom works full time and my dad is retired but still works and won't take care of her without my mom regardless. 

I trust what my dad says :/ He already said that we shouldn't overload it. I think it's pretty bad. 
"
SensitiveBugGirl,"I think we spend about $220 a month on gas....that is my husband driving to work and back and taking us to the store. Maybe camp with my parents one weekend a couple hours away. I totalled up what we spent on food. January was $465.17 not including coupons for food. I googled that, and for our family size (3). That was literally the average. "
SensitiveBugGirl,"How long does it take to transfer money to a different company/checking account in an emergency? I don't foresee that being an issue because we rent, but you never know. 

Edit: Although we do have a couple credit cards with $6000+ limits that would be able to tie us over if there was an emergency. "
Jaeyx,"pretty much just ""what have I been spending recently?""

I know I have 300-500 to save every month. I know I don't want to spend it all. so I'll spend 50-60 a month. every time I go to buy something I just do some mental math ""what have I bought recently?"" if it is more than 50-60 bucks I'll generally just hold off."
Jaeyx,"My best guess is that it's a 3 month contract role, where maybe employers don't have to pay their portion of taxes (where as for W-2 employees they do?), which means the recipient has to pay more in taxes themselves. but in this case the employer is saying ""hey we'll be paying our part, so you just need to pay the normal income taxes you're used to.""


But I am by no means knowledgeable on the subject. this is largely a guess."
Jaeyx,"Im 24. got up to 20K ish before I dumped it all into my car loan to pay it off early. so sitting on around 10K now. but I have infinity student loan debt still, so not like I feel like celebrating or anything.


But when I graduated college I probably had like a grand or so. "
Jaeyx,"go through the process and see what they offer. if the time or pay is not suitable, tell them so, and see what happens. best case, they work with you. worst case, they can't and you turn down the role the same as you would anyways."
Jaeyx,"you are making around 65K per year, which averages around 5.4K per month. after taxes, let's say something like 3.7K. You are spending 2.3K on bills, excluding food and misc. So that leaves you with 1.4K for food and misc a month? I imagine you should be at like, 400-500 tops in that bucket. so I'd say you're saving 900$ a month?"
Jaeyx,"that's a boat load of paid holidays and PTO. I only get 6/7. seems like reasonable entry level finance pay. I started at 55K in Keene with 6 holidays and 2 weeks vacation (80 hours).

Honestly, that PTO really stands out to me. granted I've only have 2 jobs for context."
Jaeyx,"idk if it is optimal (especially without knowing interest rates) but Id just pay off the debt as fast as I could. just for the peace of mind. but budget your mote expensive life changes that are coming up first. make sure you aren't spending above your income. the way I see it, your savings should be used on debt, or an emergency. none of your lifestyle changes should ever dip into it or you have a problem. so long as you stay income positive, I'd start dumping all your leftover income into student loans, and possibly some portion of that savings as well"
Jaeyx,"I just export my bank transactions to excel each month, and label every line by what it is (food, gym, rent, student loan, etc). then I total things up month by month side by side. is pretty quick and easy. If you don't know what a few lines are, just ask the wife"
Jaeyx,"I mean, I only really see the same few loans. vehicle, student, and home. with am honorable mention to credit cards. ignoring CC, those are all pretty normal and self explanatory I would think?


outside of the people who ended up deep in CC debt, and are looking to roll them into a loan for lower interest."
Jaeyx,"just log into your bank account, click the ""export to excel"" button. then next to every transaction just type what it is. ""food... rent... food... insurance... food... cable...""



annndddd now you know. it takes 5 minutes every month, tops. look at every month side by side. see where you are spending too much money. start spending less money there."
Jaeyx,"yeah that 55K is also a bit high because Keene is a desolate wasteland as far as corporate talent goes. so they pay a bit better than average I think, for entry level. plus it was just a massive massive company who could afford it."
Jaeyx,"in general, keep federal loans separate from private, because they have a lot of perks (flexibility) that private loans don't have, and would be lost if consolidated. I thought federal would automatically be in your name no matter what, but maybe not parent plus loans (my parents credit was too bad for those, so I never learned about them). private ones are pretty easy though. just get all the needed info, and look up student loan consolidation companies. pick one that offers lowest interest."
Jaeyx,"there is some security in using a credit card verse a debit card as well. If you are responsible and pay it off every month, it's mostly just upside. don't buy anything you wouldn't buy with the cash in your bank. "
Jaeyx,"that sound banging. the salary is the lower end of the range Id expect but like... it's still pretty reasonable, and with such good pto, I'd be happy with it probably. seems like a great place to get started, of nothing else. "
Jaeyx,"sure, but mine was 6%. and the payoff definitely was not inclusive of the next 4 years of interest payments. it was just the current balance. possibly slightly higher, but not more than 100-300. that would have added almost 3K or so to it."
Jaeyx,"so long as your expenses don't change, you could probably afford it. I dunno if I'd recommend it though. it kind of locks you in to living with parents until it's paid off. or you make more. if anything, I'd save up and put a larger chunk down in it to he safe maybe.

edit: actually your student loan payments are low enough that you should be comfortable even if you do end up having to pay rent. I was making 55k, bought a 17k car, and was paying 850 a month in student loans, and 1200 in rent... plus all my other bills. i think it was a bit more than i should have spent, because if the size of my student loan payments, and rent. but not an issue for you. so I'd say you're likely fine."
iloveregex,I also have a Citi DC and my card expired. My new card came with the envelope open. 🙄 Needless to say I did not activate it and they are sending me a new card through a different postal service method...
El_Cartografo,"$35K in student loans for a degree from a uni that charges $70K/year might be worth it depending on the degree (e.g. law degree from Harvard).  If it's a B.S./B.A. that pulls a mid-level salary, then transfer somewhere cheaper.  That will take some research, and an appointment with a career counselor (perhaps not at your school, as they will try to keep you enrolled there for $).  Get a paid internship/work study.  Take a gap year, get a job, and save some money for tuition."
El_Cartografo,"I find it hilarious that the same agent calls me every 6 months to see if they can get me to switch, and they continuously submit a quote for double what I pay to the agency I've been with for the last 15-20 years.

El_Cartografo,"I've had this happen with my CU and a credit card payment.  It really just takes speaking with a competent rep.  You might also talk with the branch manager about the misapplication of the payment and the prior rep's inability to help.  In my case, they were able to remove the late fee, and correct future handling."
El_Cartografo,"You will need a physical card.  I believe you can get a temporary one when you apply for a replacement at SS.  That is, unless you have a passport.  I don't know if an enhanced ID will work in lieu of a passport, though.  Your new employer will need it for the I-9, Verification of Employment Eligibility, form."
El_Cartografo,"Airbnb saved me a metric shit ton over hotels when I went to Maui four years ago.  I had rooms in houses for ~$90/night on the beach in Kihei, in Paia, and a cabin in Hana.

El_Cartografo,"You can legally write a check on a blank piece of paper as long as you have the routing/account number.  That being said, it will be flagged, put on hold until it clears, and future deposits to that account will probably be held, too."
El_Cartografo,"I disagree with providing them with more info.  Since the loan was opened fraudulently, this info may be added to the account to make it appear more valid.  I would send a certified letter of dispute requesting PROOF OF VALIDITY from the lender.  Keep a copy.  You will MOST LIKELY need this in the future."
atlblaze,"&gt;I know you can't put pre-tax money into a Roth.

Do you know?  If so you wouldn't be asking this question.  :P  

You have to declare all your taxable income anyway.  So they know exactly how much money you've earned and what taxes you've paid on that.  

What you do with your money beyond that is your business alone as long as it's legal.... like putting money into your roth IRA.  "
atlblaze,"The market went down something like 54%.  Not knowing where the bottom was, many panic sold.  Also some had no choice but to sell, like those already retired.  home values plummeted... so if you had to sell your home for any reason, you were screwed.... what you still owed on your mortgage was likely far more than the home was now worth.  

Also many people lost their jobs due to layoffs, companies going under, etc.  Then those workers couldn't pay their mortgage, so they lost their house, etc. etc.  Huge crisis.  

I was in college at the time (sophomore and junior during the worst of it).  Luckily, my family was fine.... so it didn't affect me much.  Wish I had invested at those lows!"
atlblaze,"A roth IRA is simply a specific type of brokerage account -- in this case, a retirement account.  There's also a regular IRA.  A brokerage account is basically just an investment account, an account that can hold investments in stocks, mutual funds, bonds, etc, etc.  

No, you don't just put it in and forget about it.  you have to specifically invest in something, like a mutual fund or ETF.  If you just throw money in there without actually investing in anything, it won't grow.  

People have brokerage accounts for all sorts of reasons.  people invest in stocks and other things for reasons other than retirement, of course.  

Have you read through the sidebar?  Honestly, your knowledge level is so basic, I'd suggest reading and taking in every article you can.  Googling your questions should yield article that explain finance is basic terms....start with ""what is a brokerage account?"" and go from there.  

Excellent that you're starting early!   "
atlblaze,"You couldn't possibly have made this aunt sound any more financially (and otherwise) irresponsible.  So why are you even considering this?  You don't even know what this alleged business even is!

At the very least, find out those details before deciding to go ahead with anything.  But it seems pretty clear to me and everything else that this is a hard NO.  "
atlblaze,"Well, you could easily be making 6 figures by 35 as an engineer.  Heck, you could be making 6 figures by age 25.  

You say you get ""shit grades.""  But are you good with math and science or whatever it is you'd need to be proficient in to actually become an engineer?  

Millennial here, and I am not screwed.  However, I was fortunate enough to have my parents pay for my education, unlike many of my peers who are still saddled with student debt years and years after college.  

I bought my house shortly after turning 26..and I'm on track for a healthy retirement.  So yes, all the things you mention are possible.  (BTW I still make nowhere near 100K...but  I am getting slightly closer each year).  "
atlblaze,"Credit cards come with far more protections than debit cards.  Much easier to fight fraud.  Also, no overdraft risk.  It makes it much easier (for me anyway) to manage finances without having to worry about debit charges immediately being taken out of your checking account.  

There’s plenty of zero fee credit cards.... and most have rewards.  So you’re throwing away free money if you don’t use them.  

That’s of course if you use your credit cards responsibly.  You must pay off your statement balance in full each month.  You only run into trouble when you rack up charges that you can’t actually pay back.  I’ve never paid an interest charge or credit card fee in my life.  

Also — good luck getting a mortgage with no credit score.  Building up credit is important."
atlblaze,"It’s possible the default option is the company stock and OP’s family members simply never reallocated or selected other funds.  I’ve heard of this before, especially when it comes to company matching.  

Their 401k likely has at least a few diff options,  but could still be pretty darn limited, depending on what the company has selected.  "
atlblaze,"I already answered you in more detail above... but the person you're replying to is being confusing.  First he says get a S&amp;P 500 fund and then recommends a total market fund.  Similar, but different things.  

Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 fund is VFIAX.  "
atlblaze,"This is about 5x too long a post for what you're really asking.  Yes, by all means go look for another job.  Doesn't look like you have a single reason to stay.  I wouldn't quit before you have another job lined up though.  

Things to consider though:  Will you be able to make the same or better pay somewhere else?  And... it's a fact of life that many if not most people do not like aspects of their jobs....so you may find a different job just as unenjoyable. "
atlblaze,"The recession ended June 2009 btw... so about a year before you graduated, probably.  I also graduated in 2010.  I personally didn’t have that much trouble getting a job, and neither did many of my friends.  can’t speak for everyone though, of course.  Still working at the same company I started at 8 1/2 years ago.  

Anyway, good luck with the savings.  It’s not too late to start.  

"
atlblaze,"Don’t know what you mean by a $20 Ira fee.  Each fund has it’s own expense ratio.  Could come out to more or less than $20 depending on how much money you have invested and what the ratio is.  

Yes, the vanguard fees are almost definitely better than your company 401k.  

So I’d suggest contributing enough to your 401k to get the max match and then go with an IRA.  

Not all of their mutual funds have a 3k minimum — some are at 1k.  And pretty sure there’s no minimum for their ETFs, so look into one of those perhaps, like VOO (sp500). "
atlblaze,"Many places will accept an offer letter in lieu of pay stubs, etc.  It's common for you to have to pay first and last month's rent, in addition to a security deposit perhaps.  Are you in a place to pay those up front?  

Can you have your parents co-sign if you don't meet the income requirements on your own?   Or would you meet them if you include a roommate?  

I got around this issue by finding a room to rent in a townhouse (on craigslist) when I moved to start my first full time job out of college."
atlblaze,"Mortgage payment never changes with a fixed rate.... unless you have escrow as part of your mortgage, which is pretty common.   That pays for insurance, taxes, and other random city fees, whatever.  Mine fluctuates slightly yearly.  This year went up about $155/month due to a property tax hike (had a 3k+ escrow shortfall).  So... that sucks.  

With the principle/interest portion, the combined total of the two is always exactly the same.  But with each payment, more goes towards principle and less to interest.     "
atlblaze,"You're way ahead of many of your peers.  That 50K could easily turn into anywhere from around 275-700+k over the next 35 years if left untouched and invested.  

And OK, so you're going to start contributing to your retirement again one year from now, at age 31.  No 401k, so let's say you contribute the 6K max to an IRA.  

run through a compound interest calculator: 6K contributed at 7% interest for 34 years gets you to $823,421.27  -- that's in addition to whatever your 50K gets you.  

You're looking at over a million dollars.  Perhaps well over a million dollars.  

AND There's no reason to think that you will forever work at a job with no 401k, and the IRA limits will increase over time, and you'd be able to make catch-up payments once you get to age 55....so you'll have opportunity to contribute even more and have even more for retirement.  

You could be quite well off thanks to the nest egg you already have.  

And you can always contribute to non-retirement accounts....also known as just regular (taxable) brokerage accounts!  


"
atlblaze,"It only matters when you get paid.  Paid in 2019, file for 2019 taxes.  Also... the first missed paycheck was in January, anyway, not December (though some of the work was in December).  So none of it was ever gonna be for 2018 taxes.  "
atlblaze,"It’s already 2019.  You have another 53 days to make contributions that count towards the limit for 2018.  

Then you have until around mid April (tax filing deadline) the following year to make your 2019 contributions, and so on.  

Limit was 5,500 for 2018.  Increased to 6,000 for 2019."
atlblaze,"What an unfortunate situation.  I am not a lawyer — but don’t see how the ex would be liable for anything.   Sure, he’s a jerk for not letting your GF know about the notices... but legally responsible?  Highly doubt it.  

It’s ultimately your GF’s responsibility to stay current with her loans.  From your description, sounds like she just assumed they were all being paid automatically without actually logging into the loan service website to check.  And she should have updated her address.  

Does seem bizarre for the loan company to not try to reach out by other means, especially since you say some of the loans were being paid.   Couldn’t hurt to call up and plead your case... maybe they can ease the burden somewhat?  Maybe they did make a mistake with the autopay settings?  

But were they legally required to try to reach out via other means?  Good question for a lawyer/expert in this field. "
atlblaze,"They ALL do this, sadly.  It's standard operating procedure.  Raising the price that is.  It's a game you have to play.  You have to threaten to cancel and get that price as far down as they'll take it.  At the very least, they'll probably take $10 or $20 off a month.  Depending on who you get and how long you're willing to spend on the phone, mayyyybe more.  If you keep saying no to their offers, they might just keep dropping the price.  

That said, sounds like you've had an amazing deal on internet for OVER 3 years - $29.99 is practically unheard for many parts of the country.  $69.95 actually is a very common, fair price for internet service a month.  Wish it were less, but that's a pretty standard price. 
"
atlblaze,"&gt;My tax guy said I am not meant to put more into an HSA than I expect to spend in the year. I had not heard that previously.  

Definitely not true.  You can contribute the max that you're allowed to.  Doesn't matter at all how much you expect your medical expenses to be in any given year.... and you can reimburse yourself years in the future if you want to -- or never.  Many people use it as an extra retirement account.  

&gt;He said ""excess contributions was $6700"".  

Well.  Did you over contribute?  Believe the limit for 2018 for most was $3,450 for a single person and $6,900 for a family.  

"
atlblaze,"You can't put in pre-tax money into your roth, so ALL the money you put in there is post-tax.  Your employer isn't ""handling the tax payments"" on the money going into the 401k.  That isn't how that works, with a typical 401k anyway.  You will pay tax on what you withdraw after age 59 1/2 (or if you withdraw they money early, you'll pay tax then, plus a penalty).  

If you contribute to a standard IRA (NOT roth), then you indicate that on your taxes so you can get that tax credit."
atlblaze,"S&amp;P 500 is an index comprising of the 500 biggest U.S. companies.  It's one of the 3 big U.S. indexes -- the other two being the NASDAQ (mostly tech) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (actually only comprised of 30 companies).  

S&amp;P 500 index funds track/mirror that index.  All major brokerages have S&amp;P 500 mutual funds and ETFs, I guarantee you.  Fidelity and Vanguard offer a variety of options there.  

Now, does your specific 401K plan offer one?  I sure hope so, but not necessarily.  

Total market funds are similar, but different.  They are also mostly comprised of large cap stocks... they have all of the S&amp;P 500 companies plus a little bit of everything else, too.  One is not necessarily better than the other... it's personal preference.  

You can see which companies comprise any fund by looking at the details of that fund on the brokerage website.  

YES, the Fidelity 2045 fund is an example of a 3-fund portfolio.  Looking at it, it's currently 63.67% U.S. stocks (total market fund), 26.94% international stocks, and 6.56% bonds  (plus 2.83% other).  Yes, each year closer to 2045 it should rebalance, gradually increasing bond to stock ratio.  

"
atlblaze,"You say television company, but you be more specific?  What’s the position?  Entry level?  TV news?  

I’d take Glassdoor with a grain of salt to be honest.  Pay in TV production jobs when just starting is pretty crappy.  I know because I experienced it.  I made 25K a year at a major major broadcasting company not terribly long ago in an entry level position.  And that was in Atlanta, not middle Georgia.  

At least 29k a year is far more than you’re currently making.   And I bet there’d be opportunity for OT?  And probably could get a raise and or promotion within 6-12 months, I’d imagine.  "
NotBasileus,"For those sorts of ""mid-term"" savings I go with a conservative bond-based fund - personally I use a fund of tax-free municipal bonds. It's a bit more at risk of temporary losses than a HYSA, but much more stable than equity. In return you get about double the return of a HYSA.

Over the term you're talking about though (3 years), it would only make a difference of about $3k (you'd end up with \~$74k with the HYSA, and \~$77k with the bond-based fund), so not a big difference either way."
NotBasileus,"Expense ratio is the percentage of your total holdings that you will pay back to the fund every year, the cost of running the fund. The easiest way to account for it in projections is to simply subtract it from the annualized return.

So for example, VFINX has a lifetime (since 1976) average annualized return of 10.72% ([according to Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/performance/vfinx)), and an expense ratio of 0.14%, meaning it has a roughly 10.58% ""real"" return. Then you can just throw the rest of your information into a compound interest calculator (such as [this one](http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm)) to get a rough idea of how it should look in the future.

So in your scenario (ignoring the 6% return since we have the actual data), this would be an average projection for VFINX:

* 5 years: $248k
* 10 years: $498k
* 25 years: $2.86m

Obviously doesn't account for taxes, major world/historical events that could happen, market bubbles and corrections, and a variety of other things that could impact real future performance, but should give a reasonable ballpark estimate.

&amp;#x200B;

Note: VFINX also pays quarterly dividends. This assumes you have those set to reinvest rather than taking them as cash payouts.

Also note: VFINX is currently closed to new investors, so if you don't already have shares in it, you can't buy in right now.

Also also edit: After further research, I’ve found sources saying both that annualized performance does and does not include expense ratio. It appears you’ll have to look into the details of who produced the numbers for the source your looking at. Somewhat annoying, but good reason to get one research source and stick to them so you can make you’re calculations consistently."
NotBasileus,"Working out the logistics of stuff like this can take months. If you keep pressing so hard you’re more likely to just make them angry.

Unless you’ve got other job offers on the table I’d wait at least a couple weeks before bringing it up again.

And if it’s that urgent to you, you should be seeking out competing offers."
NotBasileus,"Any general IT degree (i.e. computer science) as there aren't too many degree programs that have a security specialization, much less a sub-specialty within security.

That isn't to say there isn't specialization in the industry, but what will matter more in that respect are professional certifications (and ultimately, experience).

You'd probably find yourself either being a generalist or a specialist. Generalists tend to work for a company's security department, managing a variety of security solutions across the IT spectrum including endpoints, network perimeters, data, applications, etc... Specialists more often work for security vendors focusing in depth on one of those things.

Generalists have more flexibility to find or change jobs, as well as setting them up as all around better security professionals because they know about all the moving parts they might have to interact with, but specialist roles tend to be where the money and career advancement is. I started off in a generalist role where I learned a lot and got my foot in the door, and then transitioned to a specailist role which is where my career really took off, seems to have worked out well so far.

Happy to answer any questions in more depth if there's anything you'd like to know more about. The world desperately needs more InfoSec professionals and I'll do my part to evangelize!"
NotBasileus,In most cases you need some kind of leverage to make a compelling case for an unscheduled raise. If you could bring a competing offer to the table (that you would be willing to take of your current employer refuses to match or at least compete with) that would be ideal.
NotBasileus,"InfoSec (AKA IT Security AKA Cybersecurity)

The Information Security industry has a vast shortage of qualified professionals, so if you're even half competent you can get a job almost on demand (believe me, I've worked with some real morons who somehow get/keep jobs at major organizations). All the industry researchers were predicting massive shortfalls in staffing for years, but the shortfalls are exceeding the projections. In other words, the situation is bad, and only getting worse than expected.

It's also in the mid to high range of compensation in technical fields (which are already at the higher end as careers go). You're not going to get much better without looking at law or medicine. I'm about 8 or 9 years into my career (no degree, but I got lucky with the right opportunities and capitalized on them), and I make closer to 200k than 100k.

Also, it's really needed in the world and will only be more so as technology penetrates every aspect of human life and society. There's a reason we're always hearing about major data breaches (see above RE: staffing shortfalls and morons)."
NotBasileus,"I’d say it depends on your current situation. Salary negotiation often depends on either or both of two things:

- Having good data about comparable positions to support your case.

- Having another offer (or just an existing job) that you are willing to take (or stay with) gives you leverage

If you don’t have at least one of those things, they don’t have much incentive to work with you. 

You could also consider either coming in next year with more data after having proved yourself, or even ask for a mid-year salary review as a condition of signing (if you think you can prove yourself within six months)."
NotBasileus,"You could check out REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts). They are technically stock/equity as they are companies, but they are a kind of specially structured company that has to pay out a certain percentage of their income as dividends, and all their underlying assets are real estate related. They end up having a lot of the same qualities that bonds do (regular dividends, more stable than the wider market).

Some focus on home financing (mortgages), which you would want to avoid for the same reason as bonds, but many are property management, hotels and resorts, storage companies, etc...

I suspect you'd have to invest in individual REITs though, as most REIT-based funds probably have some of the mortgage-based REITs in the mix.

Edit: Here's some examples I pulled from a screener:

* **SPG** \- Simon Property Group - 23.88% 10yr annualized total return - mix of retail, dining, and entertainment
* **CCI** \- Crown Castle International Corp - 21.32% 10yr annualized total return - cell towers and fiberoptics
* **EXR** \- Extra Space Storage Inc - 30.03% 10yr annualized total return - storage units
* **EQIX** \- Equinix Inc - 24.3% 10yr annualized total return - data centers"
NotBasileus,"Unless it would be a significant financial strain AND you have good grounds for contesting/innocence, the easiest route is going to be to enter a plea of “nolo contendere” (no contest), which doesn’t mean you’re admitting guilt, just that you aren’t contesting it. 

Do NOT just pay it and move one though. You’ll need to additionally do one of two things to keep it from going on your record where it will increase your insurance costs: defensive driving class  or deferred adjudication.

You can usually complete a defensive driving course online in an afternoon. Then you just need to present the documentation to the court.

Alternatively, you can do “deferred adjudication” where you pay the court an extra couple hundred and they won’t put it on your record as long as you don’t get another violation within some period (six months, maybe?).

Exact details and which options are available may depend on your location. Should be more information available on the ticket or the court’s website."
NotBasileus,"There are a few drawbacks for individual real estate investments:

* **Lack of liquidity** \- If you need to ""use"" that investment, you can only do so in large chunks by selling the property and it takes weeks or months to convert that into cash.
* **Lack of diversification** \- If the city your property is in pulls a Detroit, you may lose money on it, and you're more likely to have fewer, more tightly clustered investments as an individual real estate investor (particularly if you are managing it yourself).
* **Extra Work** \- Being a landlord is an additional part-time job that varies widely in time/effort/stress depending on who your tenants are at any given time. You can mitigate this a bit (and have properties farther away) if you hire a property management company, but they will eat up some of your profits.

I was just in another thread talking about REITs, but they are usually a better option if you want to be in the real estate market."
NotBasileus,"As the other reply mentioned, diversification is a factor.

It's also worth noting that those are some of the best performing REITs (I just searched the screener for REITs, sorted by 10yr annualized return, and grabbed some of the top ones) in a 10 year period that has been *exceptionally* good. There are common stocks that have done even better if you only look at the best ones out there (for example, Netflix has the same metric at 54.19%).

Moderate/average REITs are in the 11.5-15.5% range, which still sounds good, but for context consider that a Nasdaq index fund has a \~16.5% 10yr annualized return.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I'm not sure I agree with the ""incredibly risky"" description the other poster used though. REITs are individual companies like any other, and investing in a single company/stock always has risk. That's why normally you'd look at an REIT-based fund, but in this case that would expose you to loan-based REITs. So to avoid that you'd just have to approach this as investing in selected companies rather than picking a fund that is diversified by default - do your research, invest in multiple REITs that have exposure to different sectors, and focus on fundamentals around long-term stability and growth. For your purposes they are ideal - stable dividends, competitive long term performance, and relatively low correlation to other investment types such as stocks and bonds."
NotBasileus,"If you don’t have any usage at all, the credit card company will close the card after a long period of time because it is inactive (after a year or two). So it’s good to put some small, recurring charge on it (like a Netflix bill).

However having a lower monthly balance (expressed as a percentage of the credit limit on the card) reflects better in your credit score."
NotBasileus,"Sounds like straightforward fraud, if it was done without your consent or knowledge. You should contact your card issuer and work with them, it’s not your responsibility to investigate or “solve” the problem.

Hopefully they will reverse the charges (I don’t know how they handle such old charges though), and they will most likely freeze the card and send you a new one."
NotBasileus,"Since you have (at least) 12 years, you'll want to invest in some sort of low-cost diversified equity to maximize long-term return.

As an example, if you invested this in something like the mutual fund FXAIX (an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P500) assuming the market behaves as it has historically over the long-term, that $900/month should be worth about $252k when she turns 18. This could then be used for:

* Education
* Getting established as an adult (house, car, etc...)
* Supplemental income (could generate as much as $15k annually for her if she doesn't touch principal)
* Or she could keep it in the market and she would have a significant head start on financial security (even if she never added any more to it after turning 18, it would be worth about $16m by her retirement age).

If you don't know what it will be used for, a standard taxable brokerage fund might be best because it can be liquidated and moved around at any time for any purpose, but if you know it will be used for education then look at a 529."
NotBasileus,"No, it doesn't account for inflation, but none of the models in this thread do - you'd have to adjust all of them upward to get 100k in ""2019 dollars"".

So assuming an average 3% inflation annually, you'd need to be making about $155k per year in 2034 to have roughly the same purchasing power/QOL as $100k buys today. This would translate to about $2.6m. So to get that you have to either save more or increase your time horizon (which, in turn, means more inflation):

* To still achieve it within 15 years, you'd need to save about $5k per month. 
* If you stick to $3k/month, you'd catch up after about 20 years (with about $3m in assets generating $180k annually in 2039, which would be equivalent to $100k in 2019 dollars)."
NotBasileus,"I'm speaking from working with USD, but I imagine most of the basic principals should be similar. Building a house so been working with mortgage qualifications and such recently.

A quick and dirty calculation for how much house you can afford is 4x times your annual income for the loan amount, plus your down payment (which ideally is another full year's income to reach 20% of the total value and thus avoid paying PMI).

So based on the info you've provided, I'd guess you should be looking at something around 400k. Ideally, you should save up for a larger down payment around 90k, and then 450k would be reasonable. Increases in income raise your maximum at about a 1:4 ratio ($1 of income equals about $4 of house) and increases in down payment are about linear."
NotBasileus,"You might look at a study guide for the Security+ certification (just search for ""CompTIA Security+"" on Amazon for some examples). It's an entry-level professional certification that will expose you to various security concepts as well as lightly touch on various sub-specialties within InfoSec. Some of the later, specialized chapters might be too technical for right now, but it should serve as a good overview and jumping off point.

Honestly, I'd say software development and scripting/coding languages are too specific to start off with, unless you already like it and know you are interested in application security specifically. Depending on where you go in security, you might not deal with code much. That said, software development is also a well-paying career field, but it doesn't have the same shortage of talent and I can't speak to it from experience."
NotBasileus,"I believe the actual long-term average is \~2.9%, so 3% is a decent round number to use (and errs slightly towards conservative planning). BUT, it's historically been much higher than it is recently and is expected to be.

That's definitely on the low end of recent estimates. In April the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland forecasted 1.74% as the 10 yr average, and FOMC forecasted 1.8% in March but that was for 2019 only. Most of the Fed banks seem to be hovering around 2.2% for the forecasted 10 yr average. Honestly that seems like an aggressive estimate - I'd go with something more conservative (between 2.2% and 2.9%), as I'd rather have a good surprise than a bad surprise.

All that said, I'm not sure it would impact any of the actual investments (hopefully they are making the best investments regardless of expected inflation), just it's just a way to gauge what your assets should be worth in the future."
NotBasileus,"The next step up in terms of risk and reward would be something like municipal bonds (I use FTABX, a tax-free municipal bond fund, for this sort of intermediate investment).

In terms of risk, you’re going to have occasional losses (every few years or so, so riskier than a savings account), but they won’t be very large and should recover fairly quickly (so safer than stocks/equity).

In terms of reward, it at least beats inflation (unlike a HYSA). The lifetime average annualized return, after taxes and sales, of the fund I use is 4.68%."
NotBasileus,"This’ll be an optimistic estimate, but using SPHIX as an example it has an average annual dividend yield over the last 5 years of 5.99%, so you’d “only” need about $1.7m to generate $100k/year, paid monthly.

To get to that point you’d want to use equity investments for the intervening years and then switch to dividends later. So let’s say you picked really well and had something like FSRPX and FSMEX, two funds that have a lifetime annualized return around 13-14%. At that rate, assuming you start at zero now, you’d need to save roughly $3k per month for 15 years, at which point you’d have enough to switch to SPHIX and collect $100k per year in cash dividend payouts.

That’s all a best case scenario (and there are other factors to consider around risk, diversification, and taxes) but it’s modeled on  real world numbers at least."
NotBasileus,"You've got a lot of options, but given what you've said this is what I would do in your place:

1. Keep 6+ months liquid to handle month to month costs and act as an emergency fund.
2. Take about $2m and park it in tax-free municipal bonds. Using a low-cost mutual fund will help with diversification without hitting your principal too hard. This should generate about $100k of annual income for as long as you like, paid out in monthly dividends, exempt from taxes (definitely federal and possibly state and local). No matter what happens with the rest, you can live more than comfortably on this for the rest of your life without having to worry much about liquidating investments or market fluctuations. My personal choice would be FTABX.
3. The remainder is honestly discretionary. You could look at riskier investments like equity (low cost index funds still being the best options), spend it on leisure/travel/charity/etc, or just keep it as a safety net."

anonymous_1983,"I just got off the phone with the IRS. They weren't even aware of the lowered threshold until I insisted and pointed out the IRS notice and news release about it.

The matter of which one is better depends on what you expect your tax rate to be in retirement. Typically, it's a better idea to put money in an untaxed account first, since effective tax rate in retirement is usually lower than your current marginal tax rate.

The employer matching is the icing on the cake. You should check what they are matching. 3-4% of your contribution seem too low."

Morophin3,"""Choosing credit won’t help you build credit.
It’s not a big stretch to think that when you choose the credit option, your purchases could help you build credit. But that’s not the case. Although there are differences between PIN and signature transactions, even when you choose credit on a debit card, the card still works like a debit card.

With a debit card, you don’t have a revolving balance. You’re spending money from your bank account, not making purchases on credit (i.e., borrowing money). Your debit card account or account activity does not get reported to the credit bureaus, so they don’t show up on your credit reports or affect your credit scores.""

IAmDanimal,"You could go with the Fid Freedom 20XX, since that's a 'target date' fund made for retirement investing. It starts out more aggressive when you're young, and as you get closer to retirement it will get more conservative (less risky, less volatile, but lower average returns).

However, those funds have high fees, so I'd go with 65% Fid Total Mkt Idx (total market index fund), 25% Vang Tot Intl Stk Is (total international fund), and 10% into Vang Tot Bd Mkt Inst (total bond market fund).

&amp;#x200B;

If you want higher risk (but higher average returns in the long-term), cut out the bond fund and just go 70/30 between the total market index fund and the total international fund above. If you want lower risk and lower average returns in the long-term, then go up to 30% in the bond fund (keeping the same ratio for the other two). But if you're young, more stock is better for long-term investments (such as retirement planning)."
IAmDanimal,"""a safe account that generates me around 5% interest.""

Generally not gonna happen. Something like Mango will give you around that if you have regular direct deposits, but has a limit of like $5k, and isn't worth the hassle to set up and deal with for the little bit of extra interest you earn.

Your best bet is an online bank like Ally (or use [bankrate.com](https://bankrate.com) or some other rate comparison website to find the best current high-interest savings account rate). You'll get just over 2% interest these days.

If you want higher return than that, you'll have to dive into stocks or bonds, which involve risk/volatility, but still give you fairly fast access to your money (within a few days)."
IAmDanimal,"&gt;You don't notice having breathable air until it's not there.

There's a major difference between noticing how fast a car accelerates and noticing whether or not you're choking to death. My current car can accelerate a lot faster than my previous car, so there was definitely a noticeable difference at first. But I never felt like I was going too slow in my old car, and after a few weeks of driving my current car I stopped noticing any difference. So if I don't notice any difference, then to me it's not worth spending more just to have a slightly different feeling in the beginning.

For other people, that may be different. But I think it's worth considering whether or not you think you'll actually be happier with different handling after owning the car for a few weeks.

&gt; That's all personal opinion 

Right, but I didn't say it definitely wasn't worth thousands more for a high-end car, I just said that the fact that OP can afford it doesn't necessarily mean that they should be buying a higher-end car. 

My whole point was that it's a lot of money to spend on something (probably the 2nd most expensive purchase many people will make, right after buying a house), so it's worth taking a long hard look at whether or not it'll actually be worth the extra cost.

Safety ratings are definitely a good reason to spend more money on a car, I wouldn't dispute that. But up front cost isn't the whole story, and depreciation, MPG, maintenance, and insurance costs (and even opportunity cost compared to other investments, or just extra financing costs) can all add up, so it's still worth running the numbers to see what you're really getting for the money. If it's worth it to you to spend the extra and you can afford it, then great, go for it. But if you haven't at least run the numbers and thought about what features will actually impact your happiness over the life of the car, then you're just being silly."
IAmDanimal,"This is pretty bad advice. Nothing wrong with negotiation a bit. If you're polite and professional about it, the worst case scenario in 99% of cases is that you'll just get the original offer. Most employers don't want to lose a good candidate, and a sane employer knows that a smart candidate will try to negotiate. Don't ask for 30 if they're offering 6, but if they offer 12.76 and you ask for 13.50, you won't lose the original offer."
IAmDanimal,"My guess is that you entered some numbers that showed a contribution to a traditional IRA, and TurboTax calculated that as pre-tax money that should get you a refund. Then you put in that you converted that money to a Roth IRA (post-tax money), so it re-calculated your refund, showing that you now owe more than you would have if you had left the money in the traditional IRA.

Does that make sense? Not sure I explained it too clearly, so let me know if that's confusing and I'll write it out a little better."
IAmDanimal,"Your one free report per year is just the one from [annualcreditreport.com](https://annualcreditreport.com). Any others could be free or paid services. Checking your credit score/report does not hurt your credit score. You only get a 'hard pull' (also called a hard inquiry), meaning one that hurts your score, if you apply for new credit (whether that's in the form of a credit card or a loan). Lenders can give you credit without a hard pull, but that's usually only if you already have a relationship with them and you're not applying for a huge amount (it's pretty uncommon though).

As for your score, give it another month and check again. If your utilization still shows 100% but your balance is paid off, it probably just means the credit card company hasn't reported your updated balance to the credit bureaus yet."

IAmDanimal,"Click 'about this community' to see the Wiki. Start there, come back with more specific questions after reading the relevant wiki sections.

As for how to save money, just don't spend it. It's literally that simple. Find as many ways as possible to reduce your expenses (while still being happy with your life), and go from there. /r/frugal is a good place to start if you can't figure it out on your own."
IAmDanimal,"If your gross income was less than $12k (assuming you're in the US), then you don't have to file a tax return.

However, if the company withheld any money for taxes from your pay, then you should file a tax return, as you're likely eligible for a refund in that case.

Edit: Ignore what I said, your jobs may or may not count as self employment, which as wijwijwij said below, has a lower threshold for being required to file a tax return.

Also, don't freak out either way. Worst case scenario is that you pay a penalty (as long as you actually file correctly as soon as you figure it out), but it won't be huge or anything, and you'll have time to save up to pay it off before the deadline in April."
IAmDanimal,"It's better to pay the balance in full after the statement close date. Keeping a balance on the card after the payment due date just incurs interest for you, and does NOT improve your credit score more than just using the card normally and paying it off in full.

Anyone telling you otherwise is subscribing to a ridiculously common credit myth that has been plaguing people for far too long, and costing consumers millions due to misinformation."
IAmDanimal,"Credit scores have nothing to do with how likely you are, personally, to pay back debt. Instead, they're a statistical measure of ability/likeliness to pay back debt.

So statistically, people that paid back a loan 11 years ago are probably equally as likely to pay back new debt on time as someone that didn't have a loan 11 years ago.

It's not about 'getting knocked' for not having an active non-mortgage loan, it's that statistically people that are currently keeping up with a payment plan (and always paying on time) are more likely to keep making on-time payments to new debt than those who aren't currently paying back debt.

The whole system is in place as a statistical way to determine who's likely to pay back debt on time. If you want methods that aren't just based on statistics, you can go through other means (such as peer-to-peer lending), but I'd guess that rates are generally going to be cheaper by going through institutions that use your credit score, if your credit score is at least decent."
IAmDanimal,"You only pay a ton of interest if you only make the minimum payment every year for 30 years. At 70-80k, a 215k house means a 43k down payment. After the down payment, you're looking at a 172k loan. If you're taking home about 55k after tax, your loan is just over 3 years' worth of your take-home salary.

That means that if you only spend half of your annual income on other stuff, you can pay off your mortgage in about 6 years (well, closer to 7 or 8 after the interest, but still faster than 30).

Then after that you only have to deal with maintenance, property tax, utilities, etc., and all that money that was going to the mortgage can now go towards other savings goals, or just spending more on whatever else you want.

&amp;#x200B;

215k really is pretty cheap for a house on your salary. You could make it work for something at double the price if you really needed to, so you don't need to stress like crazy. Try making a budget to see what the math actually looks like if you buy the house."
IAmDanimal,"So at $1k/month for healthcare, that's 12k/year. That means that of your spouse's additional $31k/year income, you'll have $19k/year left for other stuff.

IAmDanimal,"Also, what's your salary like and what's the cost of living like where you live (high/medium/low cost of living area)? With that, we can tell you a little more about what kinds of things you'll have to do to live within your means and be smart about your financial future. Without at least some idea of your salary and cost of living where you are, it's hard to give any advice other than just the standard 'reduce your expenses, stick to a budget, and pay off  debt asap'."
IAmDanimal,"Yes, they will match half of any of your salary that you contribute to your 401k, up to 6% of your annual salary. The contribution you make gets deducted from your paycheck and goes directly into the 401k account, and their contribution then gets added. The company contribution doesn't count toward the annual maximum contribution amount ($19k for 2019 if you're under 50 years old)."
IAmDanimal,"Pay off the 6.2% loan first, definitely. If you're saving to buy a house, then save for the down payment for that next. If you can live comfortably on one income, then your emergency fund really only needs to be like 6 months of expenses (if that), so don't worry about buffering that like crazy.

After that, either invest in retirement accounts if you want to retire early, or just pay off the loans first. Retirement accounts might help you get a little more ahead, but loans can stress people out, and at your combined income level it's probably better to avoid stress by paying the loans off first (if they're causing you stress).

Either way you'll be living pretty comfortably. You can split the difference and pay off the 6.2% and the 4% loan first, then switch to retirement savings if you want, but again, you're fine either way so I wouldn't stress too much about it. It's more about how aggressive you want to be and how much risk/market volatility you're comfortable with."
IAmDanimal,"Most people with 3 credit cards don't have 100k available. The average limit for people with a FICO score of 780+ is about $9,500, so if you have a great score and 3 cards, you're still under 30k available credit.

Granted, that's still way more than most people need. But having more cards open (and being paid on time) statistically makes you more likely to pay new debt (like a new credit card or a loan) on time. So that's why total number of accounts is a factor that affects your credit score. Credit score has nothing to do with what people need or how they're individually using their credit. It's just a statistical method to determine how likely a person is to pay back debt."
IAmDanimal,"Your goal for after graduation should really be more about trying to live a lifestyle you're comfortable with while still saving money for the future. In the 5 years after graduation, a million different things could happen that could change your path in life, so it's honestly not worth focusing on something so specific as saving money for a duplex to rent out right now.

You might get into a relationship where your other half already owns property, or has serious plans to buy property somewhere (and is strongly against renting out half). You might find that your job isn't what you expected and you go back to school to get a Ph.D. for a few more years. You might move to somewhere where cost of living is way more expensive and you can only afford an apartment or a very small house (or move somewhere cheap and buy a decent house without dealing with the rental side of things).

It's a reasonable goal, but if you don't know anything about being a landlord, buying property, or doing home maintenance/repairs, it might make sense for you to just focus on other smart financial decisions at this point like saving money and figuring out how much it would cost you to rent or buy a house just for yourself."
IAmDanimal,"Your income tax burden is based on your total income, with 'regular' and 'bonus' pay being counted the same. You don't get taxed extra on bonus pay, it just looks that way because more of it gets withheld. But you get back any extra that was withheld when you file your tax return for that year. You can adjust your withholding allowances though, so you can make it so you end the year with a $0 return (which is what you should generally be trying to do anyway)."

IAmDanimal,"Fun fact: If you pay your credit card bill on time, you can get that cash back (more than 1% on many cards), without paying a dime in interest. Set it to auto-pay, and it's even easier.

Yes, there are plenty of people out there that don't fully understand the implications of using a credit card, and how to handle money. Those people should probably not get credit cards in the first place. But plenty of us pay attention to what we spend, how much is in our checking account, and use credit cards in a way that helps us save money instead of paying more money in interest.

And if a financial emergency comes up, my improved credit score (from correctly using credit cards in the past) will help me get a loan at a reasonable rate if I really need it (although an emergency fund is better for this purpose)."
IAmDanimal,"Just weight it against other options. The other 'risky' investment most people look at here is stock index funds. Most here would estimate about a 10% return (not including taxes or inflation), maybe a little less.

With real estate, you have to also factor in the time/effort to manage the property, determine the tax burden if/when you sell the property, factor in maintenance/repair costs for the duration that you keep the property.

You also have to factor in the cost of having tenants move out (including lost income from not having tenants, and costs associated with maintenance/repair for new tenants and any costs associated with finding new tenants, such as legal fees, background checks, advertising, and/or whatever else you do when a tenant moves out.

Also, you need to factor in the risk/reward of the housing market. If the housing market goes up in the area where the property is, then you can either increase rent for your tenants (if you want), or if you sell the property you can make more money. If the housing market is down, your tenants will probably keep paying the same rent (at least for awhile), but if they move out then you may have to decrease the rent you charge, or sell the house at either a loss or just less profit.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn't just an 'investing' question, it's more of a business question. If you're good at the business of renting out properties, then it maybe be a smart decision to keep renting out properties. If you're not as good at it (or don't trust the market where the property is), or you just want a more hands-off investment, then stocks or other investments may be better options for you."
IAmDanimal,"If you're planning on moving within a few years, then renting is probably the best bet for you for now. You'll spend a ton of money just getting into the house (closing costs, inspections, whatever updates you make, the cost of moving, furnishing, etc.), then you'll lose another 5-6% in commission when you sell the house. You're also probably looking at slightly higher utility costs since the house is probably a bigger space than an apartment, and at an apartment your maintenance is covered and you may only be paying for some of the utilities. In a house, you're paying for all the utilities and maintenance yourself.

Plus you'll probably have to pay for at least some overlapping time between getting out of your apartment and getting into a house, so you may have to pay for a week (or a day, or 2 months) for the house while you're finishing out your current apartment lease.

So basically, the shorter the period of time that you plan to own the house, the more it'll cost you. Houses may appreciate or depreciate (gain or lose value) over time, but other than just being conservative and assuming that the market will suck a bit when you go to sell, it's best not to make other assumptions about the value of the house going up over time, since nobody knows until they go to sell (anyone telling you otherwise is just guessing)."
IAmDanimal,"[https://www.dayinsure.com/one-week-car-insurance/](https://www.dayinsure.com/one-week-car-insurance/) (  9.4/10 - ‎21,841 reviews) sounds reasonable.

You could also just call up Progressive (or whatever other insurance company you want) and see if they can insure you for a couple weeks. Metromile might be a reasonable option as well (they charge by the mile, and maybe a monthly fee? Google it, their site should tell you what's available)."
IAmDanimal,"Okay, have you called to just ask for proof of insurance? If you're insured by them, they should be able to send you proof. Just call. If they say no then they say no, but it's worth the 5 minutes to try."
IAmDanimal,"Pooling assets to increase growth really only works if you're either A, starting a business, B, investing in things that require multiple millions to get into (hedge funds, or other business ventures that require massive amounts of capital to invest in), or option C.

Option C is that if you're looking at investing into standard retirement investments, you're probably looking at something like Vanguard's admiral shares versus investor shares, where the only difference is less than half a percent in fees, and the minimum investment required to get that share class ($3k for investor shares, $10k for admiral shares last time I checked, might be slightly different now).

The difference between those fees is fairly negligible at a maximum of $20k invested ($10k each until you both have access to admiral shares). That minor difference isn't really worth the time/effort of combining the assets, and the additional risk you take in case things don't end well for you.

Engagement is something, yes. But I'm assuming (since you're still in the 'transition' to full-time careers) that you're both fairly young, and even marriages frequently end in divorce. It's probably better for both of you (at least for the next few years) to just keep the accounts separate and not worry about it."
IAmDanimal,"It's still a pretty confusing way to word that, then, and for someone that has big questions about finance, sometimes confusing wording indicates a lack of understanding. So in cases like this I ask people to clarify what they mean so we can see if they actually understand what they're talking about, or if more explanation about a topic is necessary."
The_Real_Scrotus,"The problem isn't so much the financial hardship of walking away.  You could maintain your current lifestyle for at least a year on what you have saved.

The problem is that walking away from your job might cause you future employment problems.  I'm in a position where I'm interviewing people for software and engineering positions pretty regularly, and someone who just walked away from their job with nothing new lined up and without a really good reason would definitely be a red flag for me.  

Why not just go find something else?  The job market is good right now, and it sounds like you can easily afford to take a lower-paying job if you'd be happier there."
The_Real_Scrotus,"Everyone is going to tell you not to buy new.  But if you want a brand-new car for once in your life, ignore them.  Is it the most sound financial decision you could make?  No.  But not everything has to be.  Some things you do because they make you happy.

If you want to buy new, here's my advice on getting the best deal you can.

1.  Don't buy emotionally.  Don't fall in love with a car and say ""I have to have it!""  That's going to get you taken for a ride.  Especially when you're buying new, there will be tons of nearly-identical cars at a variety of dealers.  You don't have to have one particular one.

2.  Be as flexible as you can be.  The more you insist on a particular configuration (i.e. color, a particular feature package, etc.) the less room there will be to save money on something the dealership wants to get rid of.

3.  Do your research.  Figure out what all the options mean, figure out what the average cost of that car is, etc.  The dealer is always going to know more than you, but you should still know as much as you can.  Knowledge is power.

4.  When talking price, don't let them distract you.  Don't talk monthly payments, don't talk about prices with trade-ins subtracted, be very clear with them that you want the car for $X out the door.  No additional taxes or fees added in.  They'll fight you every step of the way and try to insist that this fee or that one is mandatory, but none of them are.  Or rather they might be, but they can compensate for that by reducing the sale price of the vehicle.

5.  Know what your opening offer and your walk-away prices are when going into the dealership.  You figure this out from doing your research.  If they can't meet your walk-away price, then walk away.

6.  Be patient.  It may take you several visits to different dealerships and quite a bit of time at each one before you finally buy something for the price you want.  If your walk-away price is reasonable, you'll eventually find a dealership willing to sell it to you for that price.

7.  If you're financing, find out what kind of financing you can get from a third-party before you start shopping.  You might end up going with the dealer's financing, especially if they're running a 0% offer, but it's good to have a point of comparison."
The_Real_Scrotus,Lawyer up and do everything you can to avoid/reduce the charges against you and if possible get the records sealed after you're finished with whatever your punishment is.  Not having an accessible criminal record is going to benefit you long-term more than anything else you can do at the moment.
The_Real_Scrotus,"I mean you're definitely right, riding a motorcycle is a bigger risk, and you should take that into account, but it's an option worth considering if you live somewhere that riding year round is an option.

I wouldn't normally suggest it, but would your grandparents be willing to lend you some money?  "
The_Real_Scrotus,"It's really more like 2%.  We bought in 2011 when the market was down a lot, and our house is currently worth about 50% more than we paid for it, which threw our estimate off.

&gt;My unit is co-op apartment, wherein the co-op is responsible for things like pipes, wiring, etc, but I'm responsible for anything that could go wrong within the bounds of the apartment.

Our maintenance budget covers everything from lawn and garden stuff (new weed eater, weed killer, fertilizer, etc) to repairs when stuff breaks (i.e. sump pump goes out, toilet breaks, fridge dies, etc.) to general maintenance (like gutter cleaning, sprinkler winterizing, or yearly maintenance for our generator).  We're also budgeting more than we actually need to in order to save for large future expenses like a new air conditioner or furnace.

If you have a condo or apartment, you might need less than ours, especially where things like the yard and exterior maintenance are concerned.  On the other hand, depending on the age of the place and the general condition, you might need more in some areas."
The_Real_Scrotus,"I don't understand any of what's happening here.

You have $105k of equity in your house, why can you not use that for your down payment?  Are you not selling it?  Or do you need another $50k?

And why are you considering taking out a loan to get down payment money?  That generally isn't allowed, and it's kind of a dumb idea in the first place.  Why not just make a smaller down payment?  Yeah, you'll have to pay PMI, but that's probably going to be less overall than the interest on a $50k loan.

And honestly, if you have to consider taking out a loan to make a down payment, you probably can't afford the house."
The_Real_Scrotus,"Some people definitely do.  Some people spend more than that.  It's more likely if you live in an area with a high cost of living.  

I'm in the midwest and my wife and I are both engineers so we bring home decent money. 33% of our gross income on housing would get us an absolutely ridiculous house."
The_Real_Scrotus,"As far as I can tell there are no benefits to a Roth IRA vs. a Roth 403b.  In fact the 403b offers several benefits over the IRA since there are no income limits to contribute and the contribution limit is much higher.

"
The_Real_Scrotus,"I've got a similar question.  I have a brokerage account, so I'll get a miscellaneous 1099 that includes info for 1099-B and 1099-DIV.  Do I still need to wait for that to file if I know that it will be $0?  My investments don't pay dividends, and I haven't sold anything this year, so no capital gains to worry about."
The_Real_Scrotus,"Do you have the option to do a brokeragelink account?  My company also uses Fidelity, and we can do them, it basically turns most of your 401k into a normal brokerage account that you can invest into anything Fidelity offers, rather than the limited choices the 401k gives you."
The_Real_Scrotus,"It doesn't work that way.  You add your income and your capital gains together to determine what capital gains bracket you're in.  So as far as which bracket you're in is concerned, it doesn't matter if you had $99,000 of income and $1,000 of capital gains or $1,000 of income and $99,000 in capital gains, you'd still be paying a 15% rate on long-term capital gains.

In your first scenario above you'd pay a total of $16,690 in taxes.

In your second scenario above you'd pay a total of $16,840 in taxes.  "
The_Real_Scrotus,"You'll probably have trouble getting a mortgage for unimproved ""raw"" land like hunting land.  Maybe look into banks/credit unions that specialize in agricultural or farm loans, those aren't exactly the same but would be closer to what you're looking at."
The_Real_Scrotus,"How much I would need to set aside for maintenance.  We bought a fairly new house (built in the late 90s) and budgeted 1% of the purchase price per year for maintenance.  We've lived there a few years now, and about 3x that amount is much more realistic.  "
vox_veritas,"401k plan moving from John Hancock to Empower. Looking for thoughts on new plan's funds. My employer recently notified us that our 401k plan is moving to Empower. The other day, I received the initial information materials in the mail, and I am definitely less than impressed with the new fund selections at Empower. I am looking for direction on how to allocate my contributions. I am in my early 30’s, married with one small child. Gross annual household income is $210k.

The following are the funds that caught my eye. As you can see, there are very few. I generally rebalance once a year, if I remember to. I am very hands-off with it.



Fund Name | Symbol | Expense Ratio
---|---|----
Schwab 2050 Indexed Retirement | N/A | 0.08
Schwab 2055 Indexed Retirement | N/A | 0.08
American Funds EuroPacific Gr R6 | RERGX | 0.49
iShares Developed Real Estate Index K | BKRDX | 0.17
T Rowe Price QM US Small-Cap Gr Eq I | TQAIX | 0.66
American Funds Growth Fund of Amer R6 | RGAGX | 0.33
Dodge &amp; Cox Stock | DODGX | 0.52
S&amp;P 500 Index | N/A | 0.05
Neuberger Berman Core Bond Inst | NCRLX | 0.55

Other than a bunch of Schwab targeted retirement date funds, there are only 14 available funds to invest in with this new Empower plan. These are just the ones that seemed halfway worthwhile. Any thoughts on these would be greatly appreciated.

"
vox_veritas,"Exactly. And a consultant would, presumably, approach it objectively and not have any emotional bias clouding their judgement. I mean, I'm a lawyer, and I would almost certainly not represent myself in any legal matters outside of the most mundane shit like a traffic ticket, regardless of how competent and knowledgeable I think I am."
vox_veritas,"Thanks. Do you have any thoughts on the iShares real estate fund (BKRDX)?

Also, your proposed allocation breakdown looks great... except it adds up to 125%...

&gt; Hopefully they offer a cheap bond fund as well? I am not impressed with NCRLX.

Unfortunately, NCRLX is the only bond fund available by such a name, although I can choose the Morley Stable Value Fund with a 0.56% ER."
Ragingredblue,"Can you live with your brother as homeowners? Who's house will it *really* be? Does your family think they can come and go there as they please because it used to be grandma's? And that's aside from location, property values, operation costs, and any looming necessary repairs. A realty agent can save you money by telling you what you might realistically afford. Never buy any home without a thorough professional inspection. Talk to a financial advisor too."
Ragingredblue,"That sounds entirely doable. Food costs do not have to be extravagant. Gas is not expensive if you are close to your job. A little part time job can cover unexpected expenses. Honestly, this sounds like great practice for living frugally even after you get a better job and a lower rent. It's important to get in the habit of not living up to your income. You will save money out of habit. In fact, you can even save a bit now, even if it is only $10 per week. Get in the habit of paying yourself first."
Ragingredblue,"It is not a bad idea to rid yourself of the one loan you can pay off, even if it is not the highest interest loan. Just seeing it gone is highly motivating. It's not the lowest interest loan you have either, so it is a step in the right direction. You can then take the money you were spending on it every month and start putting that towards the highest interest loan, in addition to what you already pay. When you get a raise, start saving that money too. Don't even take it home. Put it right in the bank. You will be a better loan risk if you have a track record of paying off loans. Paying extra towards loans monthly will also save you more money than saving up money to pay off chunks of that debt, and get rid of the debt faster. Also, do not assume that a house or condo will save you money on rent. Insurance and maintenance can easily make up or exceed the savings you think you would get on rent payments. Condo fees can be as much as rent too. "
Ragingredblue,"You gain more by paying off the loans. Why do you have a 25K car loan? Drive a car you can afford to pay cash for. When your car loan equals your student debt, you're doing it wrong. At the very least, take the offer, and spend another 10K paying down the car loan. Start putting another $500 extra per month on it, until it's gone. But really, you need a cheaper car. "
Ragingredblue,"Not until the offer us firm and you know you're moving. If you think your employer will fire you immediately if they know you are moving, then wait and give two weeks notice. Otherwise, let them know so they can take their time finding a good replacement."
Ragingredblue,"What happens if one of you decides to leave, or move a girlfriend in, or wants to spend a lot of money on the house for something you may not want, or decides to quit paying his half of the mortgage?

 You need to figure all of that out in advance.  Both of you should have your own lawyers and a contract that clearly spells out all of your legal obligations.

Have either of you ever lived away from your parents or had housemates before? Because if not, a shared mortgage is a difficult way to experience both of those things when difficulties arise. At least start out by sharing a rented apartment together first."
Ragingredblue,"You have no reason to cancel them. Don't do it. You don't have to use them. Your credit score will take a hit if you do. The best thing to do would be to use them regularly on stuff you spend money on anyway, and to pay them in full before the billing period closes every month, so that you always show a $0 amount due for the billing period. A good use for the cards is regular monthly bills, like your utility bills. Have them auto paid through your card, again paying the balance off before the billing period closes. If you have a card that gives cash back, use that card for that, or get a card that gives cash back specifically in order to pay those monthly expenses. If you are responsible with your credit cards and either do not use them or do not accrue debt on them, there is no reason to close them. Keep building your credit history."
a_wright,"You can adjust your paycheck to have additional money withheld, but you may just want to leave it and adjust your expectations for tax time next year.

Having a return that puts you close to zero back / zero paid as possible is the best way to have access to your money during the entire year rather than just when you file your taxes. "
a_wright,"That's really a question of how much you are comfortable with. The general rule is 3 to 6 months of expenses, but you don't have traditional expenses.

If you are planning on moving out at some point, tally up what the cost of an apartment, utilities, food, etc... would be and use that as a baseline of how much of a e-fund you should have."
a_wright,"&gt; I don't think i'm missing anything.

This is a problem. You can't guess, you have to know. You need to know exactly were every dollar is going every month, tracking it in something like Mint. You need to track your spending and stop with estimates.

If you net $2,850 - $2,900, where is it going? You've listed about $1,150 in rent / utility / grocery / gas expenses &amp; you listed $1,140 in cc / private loan / student loan &amp; car payments. 

Where is the remaining $560 - $610 going each month? That's almost 20% of your take home that's not accounted for."
a_wright,"You don't need to speak to anyone about protecting yourself. Her student loan debt will always remain her debt (she took them out prior to marriage), legally speaking. [And I quote](https://studentloanhero.com/featured/spouse-responsible-for-debt-marriage/) "" a spouse will not be held responsible for student loan debts unless they cosigned for the loan""

Now, it will impact your shared financial future significantly if she isn't paying off her loans. It will impact her credit score and potentially be a problem for getting the best interest rates on joint purchases like a house or a car. 

You need to tackle the problem jointly. I married into about 250K of student loan debt. But I see that as our shared debt, not her debt versus my debt. 

We go after it together and we've got to down to $135K after a few years while also buying a home, a car and taking an occasional vacation in the same time period. Talking about your joint financial goals is a big help. It will help you prioritize. "
a_wright,"&gt; $800 food for both of us

**Red Flag 1:** How are you spending 13% of your monthly income on food alone? Are you eating out quite a bit? Why not cook more / take lunch to work? $800 is definitely high for 2 people. 

&gt; This leaves us with about $1250 a month which some of it always seems to find a way to get eaten up.

**Red Flag 2:** That's not a good accounting of your finances, especially since your math is wrong ($755 left after expenses). You should be tracking every dollar coming and and going out. Money just doesn't mysteriously ""get eaten up,"" it gets spent. And if you racked up nearly $40K in credit card debt, I'm betting you could still be spending more than you make. 

Dumping all cards / accounts into a joint Mint.com account you share with your wife could help you keep track of all transactions. Fully understanding how you are spending your money is the 1st step. Then you decide on budget cuts.

&gt; $1600 rent, which we are lucky to have. Very high cost of living here and we live 30 min from our jobs. Looking at 2k+ to live any closer.

**Red Flag 3:** So you pay $400 a month in gas, but you don't want to pay +$400 a month to live closer to work? I'm not saying you are going to eliminate all your gas costs, but wouldn't it go way down if you lived 5-10 minutes from work (not to mention reducing maintenance costs on the cars)? Would there be any public transportation options closer to work? Carpool options? Biking to work? Could you share 1 car? 

Also, what's the value of the time you would save living closer to work? More time to cook an inexpensive dinner instead of eating out? More time to work on a side gig for extra cash? 

&gt; She has 29,000 in credit card debt, I have 9,000.

**Red Flag 4:** How are you managing your credit card debt? Are you still charging stuff to the cards? Do you understand how much interest you are paying each month (Card's APR divided by 12 multiplied by Total CC Balance)? If you take that figure and subtract it from your minimums, that's all you are paying down your balances each month."
a_wright,"Private student loans, which will likely have terrible, high interest rates (so you will want to pay those off first, post college, or refinance asap).

I'm sure the Office of Financial Aid at your college can fill you in. But [here are some options](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/loans/student-loans/private-student-loans/) as well."
a_wright,"I'm not ridiculing you. I'm telling you all the power to find the answers you want resides with you. 

If you are intimidated by it, ask your Dad if you can watch as he does your taxes. Learn. It's far less complicated than you think it is. "
a_wright,"&gt; Being the idiot that I am, I find out I need to pay off the entire transfer balance in full before the 18 months is up or I will be charged the entire transfer interest??

First off, that's likely not the case. I've never heard of that in a BT term sheet. Interest usually starts getting charged on the remaining balance after the 18 months are up. 

But even if it is, why not just transfer the debt again to a new card before the 18 months are up? That fulfills your obligation and you won't be charged any additional fees. 

&gt; How do I utilize this balance transfer card to its full potential while keeping my payments manageable? Do I completely clear the Visa card or should I reduce the larger balance of the two? 

Move as much debt as possible to the 0% card. The APRs are so similar, you could go either route. Just make sure you transfer close to the limit to take full advantage.

&gt; Is there a minimum payment on the balance transfer card?

Yes.

*Question:* Do you understand how much you are paying in interest? Of your current $454 minimum payment, 70% of that is for the interest. You are spending $321 on interest and paying down the principal by $133 this month + your $50-$75 extra.

Imagine if all of that was on a 0% card. You could be paying down your principal by $500 a month instead of $200."
a_wright,"Yeah, I'd stick with the federal loans and the loan forgiveness protection. Your interest rates are already really close to the best refinancing rates. 

If you are already on track to pay it off prior to 10 years, then paying extra on the highest interest loans can't hurt. It reduces your interest payments over time and you won't be saddled with the tax burden at the end of the 10 years.

Make sure you have an emergency fund fully funded first, then you won't have to worry when ""something comes up""."
a_wright,"If your bill says you used 8,226 kWh, you definitely need to check your meter. Could be a mis-reading or a malfunction. If it's a malfunction, it could do the same thing next month.

I'd get the past few bills and see if they noted the total usage between readings to compare to this month."

a_wright,"Financially speaking, it's absolutely insane that anyone would go to a 4-year school when you can have the EXACT SAME degree with 2 years at a CC, then 2 years at your favorite school via transfer.

It's like being offered a house for about $65,000, but choosing to pay $108,000 instead."
a_wright,"One subtle trick is to make it more difficult for you to spend money on  a vice, eating out in this case.

If you typically put it on a credit card, force yourself to spend cash and take out a set amount each week for eating out. "
a_wright,"No one can answer that for you unless you provide information. Did you receive any tax forms for 2018 earnings? A W2? A 1099? 

If you did, go enter that information into a free tax service like Credit Karma to see if you owe any money or are getting a refund. "
a_wright,"Ran into a similar situation a few years ago. All the SL refinancing did was add a hard credit pull to the credit report. No impact on my score and didn't mess up the rate we got on our mortgage. 

As long as you leave a month in between, you should be good. You will want your report to show the new balance at the refinancing company as well as the paid off balance from the previous SL company. Otherwise, it will screw up your debt-to-income ratio for your mortgage (if it shows both debts as active)."
a_wright,"You've left a lot of information out if you want help from the PF community.

* What's the balance for each debt, credit cards &amp; student loans? (not just the payments)
* What are the APR's on your credit cards? 
* What's Wife's bills?

Are you actually tracking every dollar in / every dollar out? ""groceries/necessities"" sounds like a black hole of expenses. You can track the transactions pretty easily with software like Mint.  Until you do that, you don't have a good chance of paying down the debt because you don't have a complete picture of your finances &amp; your wife's finances.  

Do you understand how much money you are paying in interest every month with your ""not paying the cards down at all"" method? Do you have a credit score that will allow you to open new cards &amp; use 3% balance transfers with promotional 0% APR, 12 to 18 month periods? 

What does your budget look like when it's time to start paying the student loans? How much interest is being racked up while the loans are in deferment? "
MachitaBlanquita,"Do you have a professor or advisor ar school who you trust enough to ask for help?  You don't have to go into details about your mom if you don't want, just explain that you are in a tight financial situation, you don't want it to effect your education, and you are looking for work.  Maybe they know someone hiring, can help you find a position at the school, or could write an excellent reccomendation letter.

Edit, more ideas:  Also make an appointment with your financial aid office.  You said you dont qualify scholarships for your program, but thats only one kind of scholarship.  There's independant grants and scholarships out there for all kinds of things, sometines all you have to do is write an essay. "
MachitaBlanquita,"Check out the wiki Prime Directive and click on the graphic flowchart.  Good overall guideline for planning your finances.  In general this sub recommends you aim for 6 months living expenses in an emergency fund.

Job market when I graduated was pretty dismal so I think it's great that your girlfriend is working and in her field.  You have to have job experience to get the better jobs.  I do agree with others that she can't afford the car.  If she must have a car, it needs to be bought outright in cash.  Since you sound so willing to help, finding her a cheaper car might be a start.  Even the insurance payment might be improved, shop around and try tonlower her rate."
MachitaBlanquita,"I have sold exactly home but here's my two cents.  Make your regular mortgae paymebts and spend your extra cash on home improvements.  Think of them as investments on selling.  Maybe also talk to a real estate agent or a home inspector about your prospects, but there are many improvements that pat for themselves AND THEN SOME.  For example, we spent 20k on a new kitchen that made the house worth about 50k more when it sold."
MachitaBlanquita,"My parent was a cosigner so they have a their own login to my loan account online.  Did your brother have a cosigner?  That person might be more than happy to allow you access.  Otherwise, to make a payment to my loans, I go to my student loan provider website, enter my username, password, social, and date of birth, all just to log in.  Theoretically, anyone with all that info could access my loan account.  Though it would theoretically be fraud if it wasn't me.

emdoc18,"This is the best advice. I was on generic for zantac and switched* insurance plans. It went from $9/90days to $150/90days because insurance A only covered capsules and insurance B only covered tablets. Insurance companies typically have a formulary list of medications they will cover. I looked up the medications on this list and realized why it wasn't covered. Quick call to my physician and it was fixed.

*edit"
emdoc18,"How long did you stay in the hospital? It's dumb but there is a rule to be a full ""admission"" it has to be &gt;2 midnights and it's considered ""observation"" instead. Sometimes people will be ""full admits"" but stay less than 48hrs and insurance will argue that you shouldn't have been ""admitted"" because you didn't stay long enough. Typically if there is a question about how long someone may stay they get admitted under ""observation"" and can be upgraded later. Certain insurances will try to reject or pay less on ""observation"" then they do on ""admissions"". Not sure if this is the problem in your case but it may be something to ask about when you appeal. If it is they can usually retroactively change it from the ""admit"" to ""observation"""
emdoc18,That's not always true. I was able to transfer mine from American to Charles Schwab. The trick was finding a brokerage that would take it. I pay the standard fees on Schwab products. I had to sign a paper stating that I was taking full responsibility for my account and that my company was only responsible for depositing my funds and keeping records.

If you plan on making your own portfolio I'd recommend something like 72:18:10 in US Stock: International Stock: US Bonds, because this gives a ratio of 90:10 Stocks: Bonds and 80:20 US: International Stock. 

Target Date Funds take the hassle out of it because they are the ""fund of funds"" i.e. hold US and International Stock and Bonds among other investment vehicles. They typically base their ratios on your age/ year you plan to retire and automatically set appropriate ratios and re-balance over time to get more conservative the closer you get to retirement. 

You also need to consider expense ratios as this is the amount that is take every year for managing the funds and directly impacts any gains you see. For example a fund that have an expense ratio of 1% is going to take 1% of the holdings every year. If the US Market gained 8% you would only see a 7% gain. This may not seem like much but over 30 years of compounding interest it is alot. 

Again for specific advice we would need to know what is available to you."
emdoc18,"I would consider looking into Schwab's target date index funds. It takes all the hassle out of buying multiple mutual funds, they adjust their stocks:bonds ratios automatically as you get closer to the date you pick for retirement and they have fairly low expense ratios. SWYHX is probably closest to your desired retirement. If you want to be a little more aggressive you can also go with SWYMX or SWYJX which will keep a higher portion of stocks longer."
emdoc18,"I bought my life and true own occupation disability insurance through my financial planner and I pay $360/month for the disability, $50/month for $1mil /15yr, $115/month for $1mil/30yr term life. I am also fat, have high blood pressure and my HDL sucks so I didn't get the best rates. You are getting robbed man. I take home about as much as you do and my disability cover ~70% of my income because my employer covers ~20% of disability insurance as part of compensation. 

I personally pay my advisor a monthly fee and manage all of my own accounts. I only use him because he gave me a bunch of free advice ( that was legit after reading several personal finance books) while in residency and it's my first year out so I view him as sort of a safety net, though I will likely cut ties next July/August. 

Is your advisor with NW mutual by any chance? I met with a couple of guys from there once when I was shopping around and they are definitely there to sell you products not make you money. 

edit: i agree you need to follow WCI, learn how to backdoor roth, and probably read either the WCI book or personal finance for dummies which was first book"
emdoc18,"Municipal Bond funds for a taxable account? Is the tax savings worth it to use a municipal bond fund in a taxable account?


Some background: My marginal tax bracket is 35% but I'm late in starting my retirement savings (I'm 32) and I am looking for other options to help me catch up. I'm currently maxing out my 401K and I funded IRAs for both my wife and myself. All my debt (mortgage/student loans) is &lt;4% interest rates. My retirement accounts are all in target date funds (Expense ratio 0.13%). 

My thought it to run a 3  fund portfolio with just this taxable account because it will likely only be $200/month. Is it worth using a municipal bond fund to avoid the high federal taxes on dividends, etc.

Thanks for any advice. "
emdoc18,I thought I needed an advisor until I started reading some very simple books about personal finance and investing. Those combined with this sub made me realize I don't actually need one. I am currently signed with 1 until August but I plan to cut ties when that time comes. I personally really liked personal finance for dummies and would suggest starting there before paying someone. 
emdoc18,"Having had experience with a certain health insurance provider who likes to deny ED visits as not ""emergent"", there should be 0 question about them pay if you were referred by another medical professional who thought you were having a medical emergency. Prudent layperson laws are on your side. It may be helpful if they can addend your discharge diagnosis to include ""referred by healthcare professional"" which has an ICD-10 code of Z02.89, if you mentioned that to the provider seeing you. Anytime I get a patient who was referred to the ED I always try to include that especially if its what I would consider a minor complaint. 


Unfortunately, I have a feeling that your health insurance is who I am thinking and at the end of the day they won't change their stance. "
emdoc18,"to be totally honest, I m still fairly new at this and target-funds give me the warms and fuzzies inside. I am viewing this potential account as sort of practice at running my own portfolio. If I decide I want to manage it all myself one day I would definitely hold bonds in retirement accounts.]. I am just wondering if the tax savings outweigh, what i expect to be, lower returns compared to other bond funds. "
emdoc18,Some people just feel more comfortable with one and that's fine as long as you find on that a fiduciary and does fee based pricing. It also helps if you have some knowledge to make sure you are getting the best advice. 
emdoc18,No problem. Like I said I'm literally in your position right now in terms of just starting out. I knew nothing until the last 6 months of residency but with a little reading it becomes much clearer. This subs guides help a alot to. There's a reason a lot physicians work until they die and it's because they don't educate themselves and then listen to the wrong people. I'm hoping to go part time at 55 and fully retire around 60-62.;
emdoc18,"if you think that the target for your age is too conservative then pick one 5 or 10 years out. in terms of what to expect, I nor anyone else can tell you because I can't predict the market but these are set up to be stock heavy in the beginning at switch to more conservative as you age which is what a 3 or 4 fund portfolio would suggest. I picked one 5 year past my actual planned date to be more aggressive. These funds are just a tool to simplify investing especially in a retirement fund where taxes are a worry. You may want to reconsider what returns you ""want"" and rather think about what concerns are ""reasonably expected"". 10% over that amount of time is a lofty goal. 7-8% is what the market seems to do over very long periods of time with multiple bull and bear makrets and trying to ""beat the market"" is fool hardy."
emdoc18,"oh jeez, did they sell you whole life insurance? Much better ways to invest your money. In our situations (at least in mine) the only reason to have life insurance is to take care of my stay at home wife and 2 kids if I die early. The reason I have 2 different policies is because in 15 years I should have reduced my debt/accumulated enough wealth to be able to cover that amount. I would serious find a new planner who works for a fee, such as a monthly or need based. I compared NW Mutual term life with my guy and my guy won hands down despite the  ""dividends"" they included in projections."
Ghal_Maraz,"If there are other debts (CCs, cars, etc) I'd pay those down first. If not, yea, throw whatever you can at it. If you're going to pay it off all at once, then I think you need to call to dbl check what the payoff amount is.
If you guys will be filing taxes jointly,  call them to see if the IBR is only based on her income or both of yours. You can stick to $80 a month without any worries, as you're only asked to update your expected income if there is a big change."
Ghal_Maraz,"I feel your pain (similar boat)
I'd pay off the collections and put the rest into car #1. It'll open up the potential to finishing paying it 6off within 1 year, then you're just down to 1 car to worry about and you can start paying it down with the additional cash from the first car

With the remaining car, I think you'll have more luck refinancing it if you're in a better position in terms of current liabilities. Or even sell it at a loss and refinance the difference

Edit: forgot about the loan being up in December"
Ghal_Maraz,"Comments are already mentioning this but a brand new car isn't the best financial decision. If you're dead set on spending an X amount, you can buy an even better car with 2 years on it, but even high-income earners who are financially savvy buy their bmws and mercedes with at least a couple years on them."
Ghal_Maraz,"No
Whole life is a crappy performing retirement fund coupled with life insurance.

If your monthly budget is $1000, do the following:
1. Buy term life insurance to provide for your family in case you die. It's very cheap
2. If you're already maximizing your 401k and roth ira for retirement, then throw the remaining cash from the $1000 (which will be nearly all since term life is so cheap) at a mutual or index fund. You'll receive much better returns with extremely low fees that won't eat into your retirement.

Dude, just walk away from this fin advisor since her job is to keep pressuring you into whole life"
Ghal_Maraz,"I was reading Dave Ramsey and I think he speaks about what you mentioned. You have to look at your terms and conditions, but the same fraud protections for credit cards should apply to your debit card, but you have to pick to run it as a credit card. E.g. when I use my debit mastercard, it asks me debit or mastercard credit. Both pull straight from the checking account, but I think fraud protection only applies when you use it as a ""credit"" card. Look at your T&amp;Cs though"
Ghal_Maraz,"Question on cashing out 401k Hey everyone,

I recently received a job offer in another country. I have about $12k in my 401k at my current employer. I want to take this money out to pay off debt in the US. What would be the best way of doing so? Thanks!"
Ghal_Maraz,"Buy it, you won't have buyer's remorse. My wife bought me one for my birthday a year ago and it's been amazing. RX580 is worth it though if you want to save a bit, a 1060 is nearly as good but cheaper.
Wife, kids, I know what your worry is. I'd just make sure to have evenings where you can enjoy it without feeling guilty about it."
Ghal_Maraz,"Buy used. If possible, buy used directly from the owner and spend the extra $100 to have a mechanic take a look at it beforehand. You can save A TON of money but it does take extra work.
If going to a dealership, get a pre-approved finance option with your bank/credit union before going so you have a benchmark. Also, the price of the car isn't so much where the dealer gets you, it's in the finance office where they tack on a bunch of things like gap coverage. There are some good threads on PF regarding what to look out for.
Finally, budget some money monthly for maintenance. The older the car, the more to budget, but even newer cars you should put aside maybe $50 a month to cover the eventual emergency and maintenance."
Ghal_Maraz,"Saying a recession is coming is different than saying change your portfolio. Timing the market is not a good long-term strategy, but it is likely  a recession will occur within a year given the fed's move on rates and a few other indicators large banks have found. Doesn't mean we should try to time the market."
Ghal_Maraz,"If you can live happily without taking the student loans, your future self will thank you. I misused extra student loan money and made a pretty good return on it, but in the end all I ended up doing was saddling myself with more debt. IMO I would budget what I needed to live off of and then see how much of the scholarships and grants are left over to pay down debt, starting with the CC's."
Ghal_Maraz,"If wanting to save for retirement, put that premium into mutual funds and index funds. Your rate of return will be multiple times greater and you'll pay minimal fees.
If wanting to provide for a loved one in case you die unexpectedly, get term-life.
Don't mix insurance with retirement, you'll end up getting crap benefits on both fronts."
Ghal_Maraz,"So a couple of areas you can cut:
Phone bill: I'd recommend going to r/nocontract. There are a lot of companies that can give you cell phone service for a third of what you pay.
Groceries: I'm a family of 4 in a HCL, we spend about $500 a month on groceries. Meal planning and reducing meat consumption brings down grocery bills. Eggs, rice, beans, frozen vegetables, and a good array of spices are your best friend.
Subscriptions: review if you really use them or need them. Sometimes pandora with ads with worth more than a Spotify subscription. Also your local library might have dvds and blurays.
Kids: thrift stores are your friend. You're right, they get through clothes like no tomorrow. Some stuff is worth getting at thrift stores or online stores like threadup.

R/frugal is pretty good for savings tips

I'd consolidate into a loan using your current bank or local credit union. My CU gave me a better rate than wellsfargo, who I had been with for 15 years.
Once consolidated, DO NOT use your credit cards. Seems to be more common than not that people consolidate and then rack up more debt on the CCs (I know I did).
Also don't hesitate to use public goods, like parks, libraries, events at city hall. I make 6 figures and not having to spend to go out is the best thing we've ever done."
Ghal_Maraz,"Life insurance is insurance, not an investment. In this case, you want term, not whole. Whole life has absolutely terrible returns vs any normal mutual fund. Term will cover your family until they're adults and independent, and your retirement/savings will cover your spouse if you pass away after the term is done."
Ghal_Maraz,"This. Once on good terms, move to an income-based repayment plan as you sort out your other debts.
There are a lot of different and good approaches to that. I currently follow Dave Ramsey's baby steps as it's the method that has worked best for me, but independent of the method you use, getting current with your debt is the first step."
Ghal_Maraz,"No. If you have time to save (say $300 a month, which would be the monthly payment + insurance of low-end car) save for a year then buy a $3,600 used car. Keep saving the $300 and after a year you can upgrade to a better used car. Always buy used and with cash (if you have the time to save)"
Ghal_Maraz,"There is a near zero chance the US will experience hyperinflation. Hyperinflation requires that the central bank begin directly funding the government's deficit + a rapidly growing deficit, as opposed to relying on the private sector to buy up t-bills, as is what currently happens.
Another cause of hyperinflation could be massive currency devaluation caused by huge selloffs of said currency.
Coming from a country that had hyperinflation + having an econ degree, I can guarantee you the US won't have hyperinflation.
Regarding gold, the return on gold has underperformed the s&amp;p 500 over time, so you're better off just putting money into an index fund.
Good for your friend who made such a huge return, but it was very much luck. We don't see the guys who jumped on bitcoin early on be considered econ geniuses for a good reason."
Ghal_Maraz,"Because people aren't machines. Most optimal is to pay from highest interest rate to lowest, but that could mean not ticking off individual debts for a long time if you have things like an 18% car loan. Snowball method helps people stay motivated as they tick off debts as well as freeing up monthly income to 'snowball' into larger debts. In the end you end up paying more in interest but for some people it ends up being a debt payment method they can stick to and feel motivated to continue pursuing"
Ghal_Maraz,"Once you post a budget we can probably work out where you can save, what to prioritize, and that will give us the monthly amount to throw at debt. Also the moment the debt moves off the credit cards onto a loan, your credit score will shoot up because of the CC amount usage %. Stupid indicator credit score companies use but it makes a massive difference.

Edit: credit score impact"
Ghal_Maraz,"I wish my parents had done this. They were pretty successful until they weren't, and never taught us how to properly handle our finances. I'm currently on Dave's baby step 2 and will definitely be passing this on to my kids. Kudos to you"
Ghal_Maraz,"Yes. My company does the same. Prior to the yearly increase, I made my case to my director, who replied he'll see what he could do. Leaving without much hope, I was pleasantly surprised when he increased my profit sharing bonus (while the company as a whole had a 25% cut) and then gave me a 10.4% raise. Doubt this would have happened had I not raised the issue to him."

knitrat,"South Korea is great. Seriously, N Korea has been sending empty threats for decades, people in the South just ignore the whole thing. It seems way worse than it actually is when you are in the US. 

It’s a great place to make some money and see a different culture. And you can take your vacations  in Thailand, Vietnam etc. Also Korean women love Americans, finding a girlfriend is not hard. "
knitrat,"Pinching myself It has taken a few years to really effectively apply what I have learned from this sub, but I finally feel in the swing of things and am enjoying the empty space in my head where that gnawing worry used to be. 

My husband and I live in a city where most of our friends make more than we do. We have chosen less lucrative work that aligns well with our values so for us it’s worth it to be ‘poorer’, even if we have to remind ourselves of that while waiting a decade to renovate or do any traveling. We also took longer than many of our peers to settle down, buy a house and start a family, so at 40 we feel like we are doing major catch up on retirement, our mortgage pay down, and saving for kids’ school. 

A real lack of education early in adulthood about the long term consequences of student loans and credit debt meant there was some debt to deal with for the last decade. It wasn’t until this last year that I FINALLY stopped burning money on credit card interest and carrying a balance. 

When I found out I was pregnant with a second recently I was thrilled as we had hoped for one and had been unsuccessful for several years, but I also wondered how we would make it work as I had started to work for myself so no longer had mat leave benefits to cushion us from the loss of income. 

However once I started crunching the numbers I realised there was plenty of room to tighten our belts. We were able to pause our regular investment contributions temporarily, change our mortgage payments from accelerated bi-weekly to just the minimum required, and dip into our emergency fund to make up the remaining anticipated monthly shortfall. I also did another ‘audit’, which I do about once a year, of our phone plans, insurance rates, internet plan etc to save another few hundred or so a month. 

I’m looking forward to getting back to work when the time is right to get our retirement saving and mortgage pay down back on an accelerated timeline. However at the moment I am enjoying this unfamiliar feeling of being prepared for what is ahead instead of moving from one budget shortfall to the next. We are on track to be debt free with most of a nest egg by 55, although we will for sure need to work beyond that, if we do want to travel, renovate or send a kid to an expensive school or whatever else. However I feel like I now see potential in the future instead of murky unknowns. 

r/personalfinance, YNAB and undebt.it have been key to my education and success for sure. "
knitrat,"No. You need savings for down payment, insurance, property taxes, closing costs, and all the things you will find wrong with the house after you buy it. 

If you are living paycheck to paycheck there is no room for the unexpected costs of home ownership. Just about every year there is something major; a new water tank, a new furnace, a new roof, fixing a leak, replacing a major appliance etc etc etc. 

Congratulations for getting out of debt, once that is done you will be starting in the right place. However you will likely need another five years to build up a downpayment. Or, you could consider purchasing a much less expensive apartment condo and having a roommate to build equity. But a house is too big a leap given those numbers. "
knitrat,"Low to medium risk investments in Canada are usually mutual funds, which generate about 8.5% a year. So you are not going to make passive income off of $10,000. People living off passive income invest hundreds of thousands. You are better off putting it in an RRSP to save on taxes and at the same time save for a future home purchase (using first time home buyers plan). "
knitrat,"$50,000 is not a lot of money at the end of the day. Debt would be paid but what would she do for food and shelter for the ten or however many years she lives as an elderly person unable to work? "
knitrat,"I mean that’s just my opinion, that the cc debt tends to balloon when someone who is not attentive to their budget limits has access to more than one card with high limits. 

Not sure about the effect on her credit score, really that’s only an issue if she needs to borrow which ideally she won’t do unless you choose the whole get a heloc/ put that money into retirement vehicles approach. 

However did you mention that your dad still partially owns the house? That adds more complexity. What’s his credit score, who actually owns the house and is on the deed and mortgage, is he leveraged himself etc etc. "
knitrat,"You need more info from her, and asking will require her to really take a look instead of avoiding this any longer so you’ll be doing her a favor even if she is reluctant. Pull the mom guilt card if you have to, that her not taking care of this will affect you and your siblings future and happiness! 

Find out the status of the house, is it paid off or what is owing. 

How much cc debt she has and how much interest is she paying. 

What is her month to month budget (is she spending more than she earns every month? Many people do this without realizing they are.) If you consider paying off her debt this must be a required step. Otherwise you’ll be throwing your money down a hole and she’ll rack up more cc debt. Also ideally with this step you would cancel all but one card. 

Find out what social security she will be eligible for so she starts to get an idea of what she’ll be facing financially if she doesn’t address this. 

For sure discuss with other family members. Figure out a few options and present them to her. IE  

1. we will pay off your cards on the condition that you have one card with a small limit and keep a budget. 

2. You can afford to keep the house if you find a housemate, rent out the garage etc to offset costs. Otherwise downsize to a condo or something but ideally not lose all the equity and start renting, unless that for sure makes the best sense on the books. 

3. If you do the max contribution to 401k we will give you a monthly amount to cover that ‘loss’ to your income. 

Just a few ideas. "
Mr_6969_420,"I would try Citi bank. I believe the Citi simplicity card has a zero percent interest rate for 22 months on purchases and balance transfers and they send you checks for balance transfer. You can either write a check to yourself and pay off the loan or send the check directly to Santander. Then once you have the title you can sell the vehicle, pay off the credit card, and pocket the remaining amount of money for your nest egg and used car. 

EDIT: I forgot to mention there is a 5% balance transfer fee which would be 100 on $2000. I think this would be the best way to go since most banks don't let you pay your car payment on a credit card.  [Here](https://citicards.citi.com/usc/LPACA/Citi/Cards/Simplicity/ps/index.html?m=XSGO111111W&amp;cmp=KNC~01~110901~CRDACQXX~Google&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI_MmNj8Hc3wIViNdkCh0FpAFBEAAYASAAEgKsdPD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;BT_TX=1&amp;ProspectID=9FB688ACDB1B4CDBBB1FADD56F9A7212)  is the link so you can look into a bit more."
Mr_6969_420,I'm probably going to get voted tf down for this but in my experience I would recommend to never get a credit card. You can live a normal life without ever having a credit card or credit score for that matter 
Mr_6969_420,Glad it worked out. It's very hard to sell a car when you don't have the title.. most people will think it's sketchy if you tell them you pay you first then give them the title when the banks give it you 
Mr_6969_420,Did it not give you the option to request checks? If not it's fine you can always call them once you get your card... now the tricky thing is that since you got approved for $2000 then you will not be able to request a balance transfer of $2000 since 2000 plus the 100 dollar fee goes over your credit limit 
Mr_6969_420,"You should download the every dollar budget app. It's free and you can do exactly what you just said write down what you spent, how much, date, and there's a note section to add why. I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who has made it a goal to be financially independent this year. I made a budget and it really feels like I got a raise even though I have the same amount to work with as last year. "
JouYew,"I've had the pleasure of studying Baupost Group and Seth Klarman and have great admiration of their investment strategy, however it's not really useful advice in a personal finance forum. There's a difference between what's good for a fund and what's smart on a personal level. Without such access to expert analysis and advanced financials, it's a bit presumptuous to think an individual can extrapolate and utilize trading strategies in an effective way, especially with fees.

I do agree that the investment principles are useful, though."
JouYew,"&gt;My parents say to get a credit card and max it out refunding everyone at once and that seems insane.

Because it is. That might be the dumbest personal finance advice I've ever heard. Please make sure your parents don't find this subreddit.

In the terms and conditions it is explicitly stated you are not obligated to refund people. You're not obligated to refund people. That is the nature of an investment. If you were guaranteed your money back on a failed investment you should invest 100% of the time because there's nothing to lose.

You should not let this weigh on your conscious and just forget about it. It was a failed business transaction, and as stipulated prior is no longer your responsibility. It was the responsibility of the company that no longer exists."
JouYew,"**Write them a letter.**

Make sure to take a photo or make a copy of the letter before you mail it. It's important not just to straighten out the situation but in case they ever pursue the money in the future. Make your intentions clear, but don't admit anything beyond ""I made a mistake and am looking to fix it, please provide what further steps need to be taken.""

It's not a big deal! Don't sweat, it happens all the time."
JouYew,"This is never a good idea. The smaller the repayment term (one week), the more apt your friend is to miss it in a given week. What usually happens here is your friendship becomes tainted by these payments hanging over both your heads and if your friend misses a few payments or 'defaults', your friendship will be no more. Have them take out a loan to buy it (for cheaper, if you want the price to remain the same on their end). Imagine how much it would suck to try and repo a car from your friend and all the implications of that action on your reputation."
JouYew,"These systems are electronic and have many fail-safes. I don't think it's worth your time to bother with it, but that's just my two cents. If you really insist on it, I guess you can audit your own accounts but in that case why ever use Mint?"
JouYew,"This will be a controversial answer so make sure to juxtapose it with others but this is my advice:

Don't worry with servicing your debt until your junior or senior year. You should be focusing on school and not on personal finance at the moment.

You shouldn't worry about investing, either. You probably don't have a lot of disposable income. Transaction costs will not justify investing in an account to remain liquid because you'll probably need to dip into it here and there. Honestly I would suggest just keeping your cash in a checking account. If you had an extra 3 or 4k it would be a different story, for now you're worried about meeting your short term debt obligations.

So, the advice I'll be providing is going to assume you're towards the end of college, have built up some of that savings I was talking about (make sure to choose a bank without many fees and overdraft protection, like CapitalOne!), and are more financially stable/have a better idea of your financial future.

Always start with the debt. Paying off your student loans will be your number one financial priority for as long as you continue to have them.

Here's a good rule of thumb: Determine all your essential expenses, such as food, gas, electricity, rent, phone bill, etc. From the remainder, put 50% towards your student loans, 30% to entertainment (which includes literally all non-essentials, such as going out to eat with friends or buying a video game) and the final 20% to savings. This will serve as your emergency fund as well for the time being.

As you amass more income, your budget should change based on your opportunities and focus. It is my opinion the money is better put to use in your current state on other things than your IRA, but it is up to your tolerance of frugality to determine that.

TL;DR: Income - Essentials = Leftovers. Leftovers = 50% debt, 30% pleasure, 20% savings. Retirement is a great way to put that last 20% to use but an IRA probably wouldn't be financially strategic to you at this time. I suggest a mutual fund, but your employer won't match contributions (if you currently have such an arrangement). Key: Focus on your future. It may be smarter to focus on school in the short term than your long-term financial health because it may provide better economic opportunities in the long run."
JouYew,"You will build credit by not using it, period, so yes you'll still build credit at $4 a month, however it won't be significant. You generally want to extend less credit than more credit as a rule of thumb (the more you extend may actually hurt your credit).

I would suggest getting a **secured credit card**, which is essentially a prepaid card except you build credit with it.

*However*, if you're in good financial standing it's best to use your credit card for everyday purchases (meals, gas, etc) and pay it off every month. That's the best way to earn credit. Find a card that doesn't have an annual fee ([here you go](http://comparecards.com/)), and as long as you cover that bill you won't pay a dime extra. You also get better consumer protection on a credit card."
JouYew,"It will update often whenever your student loan provider reports your payments. Both paying on time and having less debt will help your credit score. It's better to consolidate your loans if you can secure a better interest rate that way.

Requesting loans from multiple agencies will hurt your credit if you cannot secure it under just a couple."
JouYew,"If you live in an economic powerhouse like the US, don't worry about foreign equities. You should select funds based on fees, volatility, and investment preferences. You shouldn't have 6 mutual funds, there's a lot of redundancy in equity holdings and your fees will hurt you. I'd suggest three at most. Check into Vanguard funds, their fees are generally just a few basis points."
JouYew,"Right so I was perhaps hoping you'd understand hyperbole and not extrapolate my comment to literally mean ""in no situation should anybody of any wealth ever invest in anything that isn't an index fund"". I still don't think it's ever of higher value for an individual to invest in the public markets (I personally have my doubts whether it's even advantageous for firms), but private equity opportunities definitely exist. As do asymmetric information opportunities."
PsychologicalCost8,"I hadn't really either, until I did some searching recently. Friend that works in HR (for not-my company) asked what I knew about my company's offerings and I was out of depth really quickly, so I decided to do some reading.

[Everybody has to learn things sometime, today was your time](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ten_thousand.png)!"
PsychologicalCost8,"Conventional wisdom says any time index funds cost less than they did yesterday is a good time to buy, because the long-term trend is upward.

There've been studies showing that it's better long-term to lump-sum invest rather than dollar-cost-average (that is, invest all you have as soon as you have it rather than try to time the market), roughly 2:1 (66% / 33%) of the time. So ""really anytime"".

Looking further into the history of the yield inversion, the true ""marker"" is an inverted yield over a full financial quarter, and even then it's taken up to two years from the start of inversion to the official recognition of recession. And even then,  it's only really held in the US - Japan doesn't see any correlation whatsoever with yield curves, the UK is mixed.

**Disclaimer: Timing the market is almost always a bad idea**.

Given the signals, a conservative route for trying to time the market could be to sit on the funds now (assuming your IRA holds in an interest-bearing account when not invested; not all do) and wait until the news and public say that the market is *starting to recover after bottoming out*, since you'll be able to invest principal + interest at near the bottom of the price hole; just investing when the news says there's a recession means you'll likely catch a price as it's still sliding. However, that does mean that if the recession is a bit of a way off, you lose the higher-rate growth that invested funds have, and the further off the peak / cliff are, the more likely the bottom of the recession to be where prices are now - not all recessions see 50% market-value-loss like 2008; they just have to be 6 months of economic constriction.

A riskier route would be to invest now, and get out the day you see news reports that a recession has started. That way you could try to catch the vested-funds growth rate, and odds are *okay* that if you're quick about it you'll still sell above your purchase price, even if you're catching a bit of the drop instead of the peak. Then hold as cash until news / public say the market is *starting to recover after bottoming out*. If your IRA doesn't hold unvested funds in an interest-bearing account, you should do some form of this, since otherwise you're losing value to inflation at all times.

Given that we don't know when, if, or how bad a recession will be, and that they're a natural part of the market behavior anyway, the traditional wisdom for someone with a long time-scale is to just go ahead and buy-and-hold, ride out the drop, because the market value will eventually recover on the other side. ((Note: this doesn't apply to individual stocks, just full indexes / economies)) **This is what I think you should do.** It won't make you the richest person on earth, but for every person who gets rich off ~~clever~~ **lucky** timing of the market there are maybe a dozen that do it badly and lose their shirt; when it comes to investing (and especially retirement savings), doing ""average"" will generally do well enough, and the risk of being clever (even in an attempt to be ""safer"") is higher than you imagine.

You're not an expert (or you wouldn't be asking this question), so just aim for average retuns. Remember: The average US retirement savings for people in their 60's was [$172k in 2017](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/011216/average-retirement-savings-age-2016.asp), and most manage not to be homeless with that - with the time you have left, just putting $5k/yr in your mattress until you're 63 would give you more than that; average market returns will do far better (S&amp;P 7% long-term average after inflation); even conservative holdings (treasury bonds, etc) will put you better off, since they roughly match inflation where your mattress doesn't. Don't try to be fancy or clever; this is one of those things where ""good enough"" *really is good enough*."
PsychologicalCost8,"There's ultimately a little truth: Renting means you're paying someone else's mortgage when you could be paying your own. So, technically, if you can afford to rent you can afford to buy the sort of place you're renting.

In an individual sense: It's (relatively) true in some places, not in others, and presumes that the full cost or rent is paid by is a single-finance unit (family or individual). If you're renting with roommates you wouldn't legally entangle yourselves in home ownership with, you can't afford to buy.

Usually, these sorts of statements are advertising some sort of program with substantial limits - total value of property, maximum household income, area of purchase (rural or urban-revitalization most common), or personal background (VA). Some of them have rough terms - FHA's require PMI for the life of the loan and have to be refinanced into a traditional mortgage to remove, which incurs a future cost.

This is also usually an advertising statement and obscures the point that if you're not putting a substantial amount down on a mortgage, you're most likely going to be underwater (owing more than the property value) for quite a while.

If you have the savings and credit for a mortgage, you'll need to start looking into things like your preferred monthly payment (to establish budget), finding a realtor to act as buyer's agent, and shop around for the best rate from a lender through preapproval.

Keep in mind that you'll need to be setting aside money in addition to mortgage payments to cover repairs, appliance replacements, and other associated costs of homeownership - all things that rent covers but a mortgage doesn't. Utilities may also have been rolled into rent but won't be in a mortgage. Make sure you take both into account when you plan the budget for estimating how much you can pay each month.

Also: remember that there are advantages to renting. Repairs and replacements aren't your responsibility; if your neighbors suck you can move; if you get a job offer across the country it's easier to relocate; yardwork (sometimes) isn't your responsibility; if your school district decreases in quality you can relocate. That flexibility is positive value to some people, others see it as instability and a negative. Make sure you know where you stand on that point."
PsychologicalCost8,"This post was in /r/personalfinance, not /r/legaladvice (though the mods have since removed it), and your post didn't originally indicate you were using a lawyer to draw up a contract - that's why many posts assumed you were trying to DIY an agreement and suggesting you'd be safer financially and legally with marriage.

I'll admit I haven't been particularly clear. I'm not saying any of this is impossible with an agreement. I'm saying it's easier with marriage, because while marriage isn't magic, it \*is\* deeply ingrained in our legal structure in many ways that make a lot of things much simpler in the long run. There's a lot of legal precedent on how to deal with it, and it can cost far less for a courthouse marriage than having a lawyer draw up a specific contract, while also conferring additional legal benefits re: visitation, survivorship, beneficiary status, representation and protection (and taxes, in certain circumstances).  However, since you're willing to pay for professional legal advice, and seem certain not to pursue marriage, they'll absolutely be able to draw something up for you that will cover edge cases.

You're committed to your path. Your lawyer will help get it drawn up right.

Best of luck!"
PsychologicalCost8,"So your point about it being messy - breakups are always messy. Divorces are \*almost\* better in that you have to go through a legal process, which gets unemotional parties involved to mediate and try to make the end result as equal as possible. Without that, it's two people in various states of emotional distress trying to navigate a bunch of pitfalls left and right.

The home valuation differentiation is demonstrative. In a breakup, odds are she, as the minority owner, would have to be bought out, so she has incentive to have the home valued highly. You, as the one paying, have incentive for it to be valued lower. How do you reconcile that, when you're already going through emotional turmoil?

When I say things are ""cleaner"", I mean nobody gets to feel slighted if things go wrong. There's equal claim to all marital assets, so at least ostensibly each party should receive an equal share during the division. ((There are exceptions, i.e. at-fault parties owing damages, where the division is directly unequal, and nonfinancial divisions like child custody that have to be given a financial equivalency, so one party on paper winds up with a higher dollar amount)) The divorce process, when not amicable, typically involves hiring an independent third party to go through and appraise all joint assets, which gives an impartial list of values to balance up.

But with a buy-in plan? Something goes bad before she's bought up to an equal share and she'll necessarily get the short end of the stick - has to move because she clearly has less claim to the property, and she's got to hope you either buy her out immediately or she's stuck owning a real estate liability that she neither occupies nor generates income from and hoping that you're covering all bills, because she's obligated to meet them as an owner. You really think she's not going to cause you problems in that situation? ""Sale subject to third-party approval"" is a red flag on a house listing, decreasing offers and lowering the price, and that's assuming she doesn't just refuse the sale for one reason or another. People do crazy things when they think they've been treated badly.

You have every reason not to do it this way. She has even more. However.

I think I saw you say in another comment that getting married is against your religion? I'm not sure if that's true or not, but if it is you could either pursue a common-law marriage (if you're in one of the 9 US jurisdictions that allow it) or go through a legal marriage but not go through a religious ceremony. That said, I know religion is not generally fond of ""loopholes"". If you're that committed to both your religion and this woman, you should go sit down with a lawyer and pay them some time to sort out the right thing to do here. Someone who's committed enough to religious prescriptions about marriage but not to actively seek out marriage within the community is...very unusual.

Good luck."
PsychologicalCost8,"There are some weird housing rules at some colleges, especially in dense cities where it's not even remotely economical for them to run their own buildings.

""Commuter Colleges"" may not have any dorms at all, or only for people whose parents live more than X miles away. Their purpose is to serve the local population. In this context, dorms being often given to seniors makes (some) sense, since older students are more likely to want to live away from their parents. 

Additionally, in a very dense city like NYC, it's possible that the school's offered housing is below market (or high-quality) for the neighborhood, and is VERY convenient to classes, so they're a more competitive option and they become a reward/luxury for students in their last year. It's not dissimilar to some other colleges that reserve single-occupancy dorm rooms for seniors.

If I had to guess, this is probably for a City University of New York school. CUNY has 24 campuses, 4 of which there are in Brooklyn, 3 of which are Senior Colleges, one of which is right on the edge of Brooklyn facing Manhattan - housing convenient to those campuses is probably pretty freaking tight, so dorms are going to have a strange incentive structure. I'm sure housing is a very different beast inside the CUNY system than at any other school.

Definitely unusual, but it might be legit."
PsychologicalCost8,"Personally, I've heavily prioritized retirement over saving to buy a house. My justification is a bit nonstandard, so don't take it as gospel.

&gt;One of the primary arguments for having a house that people have used on me is having now home payment when you retire. A relatively typical working career for someone coming out of undergraduate will be about 40 years, ages 24-64. ((Go with me here, it makes the numbers clean)) Given that a normal mortgage is 30 years, that means having a paid off house at the end of a typical working career leaves 10 years of no mortgage payments.   
&gt;  
&gt;Under the 2019 limits, people under 50 can contribute $19k to a 401(k) (discounting employer match) and $6k to an IRA, not counting after-tax or ""backdoor"" conversions, and over 50 there are allowed catch-up payments of $6k and $1k, respectively. So under 50 the total max contribution is $25k, and over 50 it's $32k.  
&gt;  
&gt;In short, if you max out retirement savings from 24-33 and then buy a house, the $250k contributed over 10 years of maxing out retirement contributions and saving for a downpayment at a lower rate will be worth $1.9mil after 30 years of 7% average growth even if you never contribute another dime and hadn't vested it in anything in the 10 years of contributions. Additionally, you'll have the equity and wealth generation from the house value accrual as well, with the last mortgage payment happening at 64 and thus avoiding housing payments in retirement.  
&gt;  
&gt; If you go the other way and buy a house up front, you'll have 10 years at the end to max out contributions totalling $320k, and only one year of it will have even 10 years of 7% growth - which won't even double that year's contribution; the total is more like 40% total growth ballpark, for $550k-ish. While the house would've had longer to grow in value, that's illiquid wealth that is difficult to realize.  
&gt;  
&gt;TL;DR, taking longer to save for a home downpayment and piling into retirement savings early can result in having \~$1.4mil more in liquid assets than buying a house early.

I know that's simplistic and misses a lot of things - it doesn't account for retirement contributions made while making mortgage payments in either scenario; it doesn't account for the fact that the house someone would move into at 24 is generally a ""starter home"" and they likely won't stay in it for all 40 years, pushing the mortgage-payoff date back when they size-up; it doesn't account for the costs of upkeep on a home, nor renovation; it doesn't account for shorter-term mortgages, or later retirement dates, or any strategies involving selling a not-paid-off house to downsize into a smaller/cheaper one with no mortgage partway through this 40-year period.

What it *does* is show that it's largely better to work on saving for retirement **faster** than for a mortgage downpayment, because the growth potential for retirement savings is much better served by early-entry and duration of investment. ""Catch-up"" contributions do not actually make up for lost time.

It also heavily reflects my personal preference for the flexibility of liquid assets at retirement. Local real estate markets can cycle up and down fairly widely, even if the national one doesn't, and I can go on Redfin right now and find at least a dozen houses in my and neighboring counties built 30 years ago that are listed barely above the cost of land for any number of reasons - essentially worthless. Real estate is not a zero-effort investment - treating a house I live in as a bank account is not something that I'm comfortable with.

So to answer your question more directly: How do **I** juggle saving for a house and for retirement?

&gt;I'm a 28yo single male, no kids, college degree. Average income for my HCOL/high-income county.  
&gt;  
&gt;I'm maxing out my tax-advantaged retirement funds. To the point of pulling the year's Roth IRA contribution out of my emergency fund since it constitutes less than 3mo's expenses and keeps me within the 3-6mo guideline, for a January-2 lump-sum contribution. 401(k) is levelled to buy-in roughly equally throughout the year.  
&gt;  
&gt;((note: This is where I diverge from the Prime Directive the most. PD says to contribute 15-20% of income to retirement, I'm overshooting that by maxing out. Also, pulling out of emergency savings isn't *great* \- I justify it because doing so still leaves me within the recommended range, but that's not true for budgets below $2k/mo))  
&gt;  
&gt;After that, my paycheck is direct-deposited in two accounts: the one I pay bills out of gets a set amount for every paycheck so that my budget never inflates; everything beyond that goes into high-yield savings, to catch bonuses, pay raises, and tax/withholding adjustments.  
&gt;  
&gt;This gets a bit messy: I've estimated the size of mortgage I'm willing to handle, and approximated a budget for that. So my emergency savings limit is actually 5-6mo expenses *at that level, not my current one*. That way once I start paying a mortgage my emergency fund will still be appropriately-sized to my expenses. Once I hit **that** savings level, backfilling after my IRA-contribution withdrawal, my monthly cash savings start moving into my downpayment fund.  
&gt;  
&gt;This means that I'm really only contributing to my downpayment fund 6-8mos/yr. Current estimate is I'm 4-5yrs from a 20%downpayment + 5% closing costs. I could get there faster if I did things differently; I don't want to.

That's my plan, YMMV. Feel free to tell me why it's dumb!"
PsychologicalCost8,"Not really. In most of America (to my understanding) it's a shared asset if purchased during the marriage, so at divorce it's often either sold with proceeds split down the middle or given wholly to one party with a comparable offset in other assets given to the other in compensation. It's difficult because a house is usually a very emotional asset and can be weaponized by one party trying to cause the other harm (e.g. forcing a sale when the other party wants to keep it), and there can be duelling valuations from inspectors hired by each side to support a different total division of assets, since valuing it higher or lower can benefit one party more than the other in many circumstances.

The basic point, though, is that since it's shared, it's considered equally owned by both spouses.

You can totally do an equity distribution plan, married or not, with enough legal fees to draw up a contract. The question becomes ""Why?"" very quickly. Why do you want her to have only some share of the house - you're committed enough to share major assets, but not committed enough for an equal partnership in it?

If you're not sure you're really committed for marriage, just buy it yourself. If you break up, you don't have to try to buy out her equity. If you don't, you get married and then when you sell the house the proceeds are a shared asset because they're earned during the marriage, and the next place will be joint."
PsychologicalCost8,"While true that the deduction goes away, the contribution *can still be made*, which isn't true of a Roth IRA. To contribute to a Roth IRA above the income limits, you have to use one of the Backdoor or Mega-Backdoor methods, which may or may not be possible depending on the terms of your other accounts (I, for instance, can't do a Mega because my 401(k) plan doesn't allow post-tax contributions of any kind; HR tells me they're working on it).

It eliminates the tax benefits of the Traditional IRA, but it's still possible to use one, if a retirement-oriented account is desired for some reason. There are psychological / practical benefits for some people to having a retirement-savings account they can't easily touch for other purposes, but that's an individual choice.

You're right, though, that because Trad IRA deductions are considered income rather than capital gains, long-term retirement planning above the Roth IRA threshold are likely better done through standard taxable accounts. There's a consideration regarding dividends-management, since they'll count as income on years-issued rather than wrapped into long-term growth and collected later, but that's a personal-tax-management preference, which they should sort out with a fiduciary or tax preparer.

((That deduction-loss nuance is one I often forget, as I don't have a Trad IRA))

Thanks for the catch!"
PsychologicalCost8,"It sounds quite possible that you won't be able to continue your current course of study. 

NYC has incredibly high Cost of Living, and having only $1300 / $2300 is...kind of next to nothing. Unless you can find someone who'll let you sublet their couch, your lack of credit and rental history is going to demand massive security deposits that you won't be able to cover, especially since you're unable/unwilling to take on a second job.

I obviously don't know your situation as well as you do, but it sounds to me quite likely that you're going to have to choose pretty soon between trying to go to school while homeless (or housing-insecure) or dropping out and working. Neither is a good option, but what you've posted indicates there might not be one.

If you have relatively few material possessions, your best bet may be to leave town on a cheap bus ticket and start doing something, anything in a lower cost-of-living area like Albany ([roughly half the cost of New York](https://www.bestplaces.net/cost-of-living/new-york-ny/albany-ny/15000) and only a $50-ish bus ride away). Spend a few years setting up a firm, independent financial foundation, maybe develop a skill - most importantly, find a steady job of just about any kind to pay off whatever you've got to repay the school ASAP (see if they'll let you set up a payment plan before you leave, or else get a (NOT PAYDAY) loan on the best terms a bank will give you and pay that back).

&gt;If you're in physical condition for it and can pass a background check, an extreme form of this would be to enlist in the military. They're having a LOT of trouble finding recruits (missed target by like 9% last year), so they have pretty good signing bonuses for some fields (i.e. Naval Nuclear) that could help mitigate the repay-the-college thing. Some of the services will [give advanced rank](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/advanced-enlisted-rank-3332724) for completing some amount of college.  
&gt;  
&gt;This route obviously has major lifelong consequences, but can be a valid and rewarding career path if you go into it eyes wide open. There are better subreddits for information on that, and I didn't serve myself, but one common refrain is essentially ""recruiters lie"", so do a lot of your own research if you consider this path.

If you go the homeless-in-college route, get familiar with your local food banks, find nearby churches with food or clothing assistance programs, take advantage of showers in your college's gym (if there is one - if not, try to find a cheap 24-hour fitness place and get a membership), search around for food-included events, and see if there are places on campus that you have late- or 24-hour access to to try to sleep (I know mine had some computer labs and video editing suites, with access depending on your major). Couchsurfing with friends is an option, but a) never overstay your welcome (2-3 nights at a time, once a month is a good rule) and b) be a good guest, help with chores, that sort of thing.

College is not a necessity to succeed in life. If you can get into a skilled trade (carpentry, welding, electrical, plumbing) you can make a comparable salary to most non-professional college graduates, with half the debt or less - sometimes you can even get paid to go through trade school. If you're dead-set on a formally-educated career (engineering, medicine, law), you can come back to school later in life when you're better set for it.

Good luck."
PsychologicalCost8,"Prime Directive suggests 15-20% for retirement. Personally I'm overshooting that, but I have low expenses relative to my salary. Without ramen-diet.

In a nutshell, annually withdrawing 4% of your retirement account's balance historically could be expected to last through a 25-30 year retirement. If you're more concerned about volatility, or want to be prepared for a longer retirement, an annual withdrawal of 3.00-3.25% can be sustained relatively indefinitely. So, to estimate how much you need saved for retirement, estimate your annual cost of living *at your desired quality of life in retirement*, then divide by either 0.04 or 0.03.

So if you currently live on $2k/mo, but think you'll want a lifestyle like you could live in your area on $4k/mo, multiply $4k by 12 (for annual expenses) and divide by your withdrawal rate. $48k/0.04 = $1.2mil, $48k/0.03=$1.6mil.

How to get to $1.6mil? Set up a spreadsheet where, going down a column, each cell equals the contents of the above multiplied by a growth rate plus a contribution. Quick mock-up assuming 7% growth (consensus on long-term S&amp;P500 return adjusted for inflation) and that your income is $70k (so 6% is $4200/yr), and that you've contributed nothing as yet, shows that at age 64 you'll have \~$840k. ((Note that this doesn't account for raises of income)) This is below $1.2mil; it will not support $48k/yr.

Using these numbers, 8% of $70k will net $1.17mil at 64, which approximates the low-end estimate. 10% yields $1.4mil, splitting the difference. 15% yields $2.1mil, above the high-end withdrawal.

If your ratio of retirement expenses to current salary approximates 5:7 (as shown above), then your 3% contribution is too low. Upping it to 5% (8% total) is minimum; 12% (15% total) well overshoots. If you can stomach taking another few percent out of your paycheck, you'll be in a much better place. It's better to be overprepared than trying to retire on a shoestring."
PsychologicalCost8,"It's a way of conceptualizing your hourly compensation, but not actually how you're paid.

I suspect, basically, the managerial role **is salary**, but they're expecting the manager to work 50hrs/wk instead of a more typical 40. So if you look at the money for time worked, the effective compensation **rate** has decreased, even though the **annual total** will increase.

They're likely trying to relate the pay to work ratio in a way that they expect you'll understand, e.g. ""how much do I get paid per hour"", when that's not really how salaried positions work. Salaried positions are ""how much do I get paid to get the job done"", and they're letting you know that the job will require about 25% more time to get the expected job done than a simple hourly position.

You can read into this that the non-managerial role you currently have has a higher time-value rate, and you would make more money *if you were able to work the same hours as expected of the manager (50).* However, as hourly you likely don't have the opportunity to get ""guaranteed overtime"", so that's not an exact equivalency. If you were to pick up 10hrs/wk at another equally-rated hourly job, you would make more money than the salary position for the same amount of work time.

In answer to your question of why anyone takes the job, there's a few things: retail tends to promote from within for management, so you can't advance your earning potential after a certain point unless you join that track; the annual total is higher, it's just not 25% higher (so your $12/hr nets $24k/yr-ish, the manager makes between $24k and $30k) to make up for the 25% extra expected working time, so there's still an increase in income; and because some people just don't want to be floor workers anymore.

What you've run into is a classic tradeoff for hourly / salary jobs. Salary **guarantees** more, but generally has little opportunity for extra income; hourly has more **opportunity** for paid overtime, but very little security on that. People usually move to salary for stability as much as any other consideration."
PsychologicalCost8,"Few things.

First, more income means more taxes. Because of marginal rates, their next two $20k's are taxed more than the $20k both of you make. So even though their gross is 3x yours, they're not actually living on 3x more. It's still more, just not 3x.

Second, you have remarkably low expenses. You spend $150/mo on groceries - that's remarkably low, if that's your entire food expenditure (i.e. never eat out). You're spending $500/mo with roommates, but someone who lives alone will have more than that, and someone with a family will need a larger home and have to pay for it.

Third, struggle can be relative. Some people feel like they're struggling because they're stuck between a car payment or two and massive cell phone / cable bills, or are barely managing to cover the cost of a desired vacation. They could have made less expensive choices, but they decided instead to try to make the effort to live that lifestyle. Or maybe they were making more money when they made the choices and lost a job and got rehired at a lower rate, or were expecting more / better raises over time than they wound up getting, and let's completely ignore the instability of commission-based income (sales and real estate). Because of laws relating to debt repayment, they can't not make those payments - and so, they struggle to meet their obligations. 

The trick is to figure out the cost of a lifestyle you want to lead, and then get a job that pays more than that (after taxes). Additionally, actively avoid lifestyle creep, and practice delayed-gratification by saving up for major purchases instead of taking on unmanageable debts. 

On a career-advice front, make sure whatever you pick is something you actually like doing. You'll often have to deal with frustrating coworkers, unreasonable deadlines, and bullshit corporate directives basically no matter where you work, so you have to be certain what you actually do day to day is enjoyable enough to make up for that. There's no (practical) amount of money that can make up for a career that makes you want to stab your eyes out. I'm not saying you have to be passionate or in love with your work, just that you like it well enough to put up with the BS. Every job has BS."
PsychologicalCost8,"I think there are a few questions to make sure you can answer ""yes"" to:

* Do you have a budget drawn up for expenses after moving out? If not, do that. Assume your current $45k salary, since you know what that is after tax / withholdings; it's relatively unlikely a $5k larger gross salary will have a lower net so long as you're in the same metro area.
   * Likely hidden cost: Food. Unless you're contributing to your family food budget and / or doing your own meal planning, you probably don't have a great idea what your eating habits will be on your own.
* Do you have 3-6mos expenses of **that budget** saved for emergency use?
* Do the numbers for a 40min-each-way commute **not** make sense for you to take the job and stay at your parents? It's *really* hard to justify moving out of somewhere you're not paying rent, if you in fact aren't, especially if you get along well with the parents. And frankly, 40min is a typical commute in a lot of places - I've got coworkers who do maybe twice that with traffic.
* Does the new job give you additional growth potential in a professional capacity? Nicer office doesn't count - how will your professional skills improve from taking that job instead of keeping your current one? Even in the job-hopping culture that's going on right now, leaving a job under a year from starting it will raise some flags, and you'll have to explain it for a long time.
* Have you been saving for retirement yet? If not, where's the $45k been going? If you're not already being financially responsible, it's not a given that you'll suddenly make it happen once your expenses explode.

There's shades of ""yes"" here - maybe the job has growth potential, but the numbers make sense to commute and you've not got savings / retirement going yet, so it could make sense to take the new job and drive from your parents for a year or so while you get things ready. The point I'm trying to make is that there should be preparation for the change, and reason to do so.

I'll admit there's a bit of pot-calling-kettle here - 28M, I hadn't really been financially responsible in college, and instead of moving back in with parents to ease into things I moved to a state where I knew exactly one person and figured it out as I went. It took me until maybe 2 years ago to really get a handle on things. If I had another chance, I still would do some variation of this (though maybe a less-expensive area) because I don't get on well enough with my parents to've made the financial benefits worthwhile. 

At the end of the day it's a personal choice. If moving out is a personal choice that you want to make, just make sure you're doing it eyes wide open.

Good luck!"
PsychologicalCost8,"Biggest problem is there's sometimes delays in cash movements between institutions - for instance, Ally will gladly transfer money *into* itself in one business day, but transferring money *out* can take 3.

Personally, I have 3 cash accounts at 3 institutions (one local, one out of state, one online-only) for mostly practical reasons (safe deposit box, age of credit card, and interest rate). There's few downsides to it, as long as you know your interest rates and can plan a couple days for transferring between institutions.

&gt;Note that there is a limit to this - having a substantially large number of accounts at a substantially large number of institutions can start to set off red flags, especially if there's frequent movement between them, since that starts to look like money laundering. But three institutions with one or two accounts at each is well below that point.

Your idea of getting savings with a high rate and keeping only a small amount in checking is a good one, with a few advantages.

1. Your savings will come closer to keeping up with inflation, so long as the high-yield savings doesn't have maintenance fees or minimum balance / transaction requirements / penalties. I use Ally, simply because it's high-yield with no strings - some give higher rates, but they tend to have restrictions.
2. If you Direct Deposit a set budget into your checking and beyond that into savings, it heavily disincentivizes exceeding your budget, since there's a required transfer of funds between to cover the overage. It helps impose financial discipline, since it's not just all money in the same account.
3. If someone gets hold of the debit card or a blank check for your checking account, they'll only be able to steal the lower riding limit in that account, not your full balance. It's just a bit harder to steal money out of savings accounts; enough that someone looking for low-hanging fruit won't bother.

Oh, and your comment about knowing your money is safe with BoA? At $15k, you're well below the FDIC / NCUA insured limits - any credible institution will be able to keep that money safe for you. Doesn't help with the same-app comment, but it does minimize the problem - is using the same app worth \~$300/yr (2% of $15k) to you? "
PsychologicalCost8,"Yeah, the downsides are heavy. Once I exceed the Roth threshold I'm going to be sorting through backdoors as possible and then going taxable.

What I'm getting at with dividends is that if I hold a stock or fund in a taxable account and it pays a dividend in September, that dividend counts as income on my 2019 taxes; if I hold it in an IRA, it stays in the account (and perhaps immediately reinvested depending on plan settings) and isn't reported as income for that year, but instead taxed alongside all other funds withdrawn at retirement. It makes tax filing marginally more or less complicated, and holding it in taxable requires you to actively manage what happens with the dividends; it's not a whole lot, but there are some people who really cannot handle money well and might prefer the reinvestment and taxes be done under-the-hood in an IRA. Remember, two out of five Americans [can't pull together $400 in an emergency](https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/22/pf/emergency-expenses-household-finances/index.html) , so expecting active management of finances is really asking too much of hundreds of millions of people.

It's one of those things where it's not exactly the *best* decision in most circumstances, but it's not burying-silver-in-the-yard or selling-Herbalife *bad* so it's good to keep in mind that someone may decide to go with it for their own reasons."
PsychologicalCost8,"I know it isn't even a hundred euros a month, but you could try some volunteering. It'll keep you busy (which sounds like a major goal), may help you develop a skill, and expose you to other people in your community, develop a social network. If nothing else, most non-profits I've ever encountered love someone who knows enough to run their website.

Doing backstage work for community theatre groups can help learn carpentry and painting skills, helping with a community garden can build up your landscaping and green-thumb, libraries have all sorts of odd jobs (shelving, community organizing, intro-to-tech classes), elder-assistance organisations often want drivers or grocery-helpers or just plain social-visit volunteers...

Plus volunteering looks really good on a resume for future work, and gives you something other than work and sports to talk about at parties or on dates (or with your parents over the holidays). 

And every now and then doing something for free turns into some extra irregular pay. Who knows.

Or go hang out on Fiverr. Sometimes that turns into higher-paid one-off things as well."
PsychologicalCost8,"28yo here. Not a professional economist / investor, but my thought is:

In the immediate future, it *may* be a *not-terrible* idea to wait a bit, because the treasury-funds yield curve just inverted on Friday (3mo bonds have higher yield rates than 10yr bonds), which is a signal that's preceded every major recession since 1975, and this is the first time it's happened since 2007. That said, the official signal is staying inverted for...a few weeks? Or months? Again, not a professional. So this could just be a blip, or the first rats leaving the bilge. ((There are other signals of a wider global economic slowdown currently, but I just read the WSJ, I don't actually understand what the words mean. Something about Germany's industrial base, China's public- and private-debts rates, and the various central-bank rate-policy signals around the world))

Given that, it's not unreasonable to think there *may* be a recession coming sooner than later. Nobody can know if that's true, how deep it could go, or how long it could last.

**However**, since you're young (I presume 35+ years until retirement?), it's extremely unlikely that mutual funds purchased at today's rate, even with a pending recession, will be worth less in 35 years.

Buying today and holding until retirement is probably safe; just be prepared not to lose your head if the value drops soon - if a drop happens, it's a sign for you to put more money in while prices are down, not take it out, since you've got time for that bet to settle out.

If you were 25-30 years older, the advice would be very different. But you? I'd say go ahead and buy into the index. VTSAX is a widely-recommended fund around here (it's whole-market, not S&amp;P500)."
PsychologicalCost8,"Dunno if any software have anything like this going, but I keep a couple spreadsheets that give me basically the end result. I don't exactly care about keeping my ""gold per turn"" positive, because that doesn't account for a LOT of things very well, but I do care about how much money I have available to spend per-day in my budget.

Instead, I start with what my checking account will be at the end of the month when I settle up bills - after 401(k), after taxes, FICA, medicare, employer-provided insurance shares, **and** after automatically-deducted savings are taken out. This is what I have to spend each month on everyday cost of living, and it's always the same.

((I have the amount going to checking set as a static number in my direct-deposit and all take-home pay above that go into savings, rather than a static number into savings and remainder into checking. This keeps my monthly budget exactly the same and inherently prevents lifestyle creep since the money available won't increase unless I file new paperwork with payroll))

From there, I deduct my ""recurring monthly credit expenses"" - cell, cloud server, satellite radio, etc - as well as rent and insurance, since they're known in advance. Right now I don't pay utilities (rolled into rent), but when I do I preemptively include the highest bill from the last 12mos as the expected cost. I have no debt right now, but if I did that'd be subtracted as well. Taking all this out leaves ""Post-Expenses Budget Net"", which is the total I have available for incidentals for the month.

I don't categorize everyday expenses (food, clothing, incidentals) - basically, anything that isn't so individually significant that I decide to pull from savings to cover goes in a table. It's split up by credit card so I keep the balances appropriately managed, but otherwise I don't care what was spent where, only how much was spent each day. I've got a column for the date, each credit card, and ""IsBlank"", where I test if any of the card lines were used that day. ""IsBlank"" is summed up for ""Days Remaining"", the expenses are summed up for ""Total Daily Expenses"", and subtracting TDE from PEBN and dividing by DR yields ""Daily Budget Remaining"". From there it's up to me to make sure I can live on what I have left.

I think this is a lot more practical than just trying to care that each single day is positive. By keeping the long-term wealth generation vehicles out of this system, they don't seem like something that can be negotiated or changed to try to game my number above zero - they are what they need to be for my long-term goals, and this spreadsheet is for dealing with the consequences of those goals and making sure I'm living within that structure.

I don't pretend it's the perfect system, but it works for me."
PsychologicalCost8,"Get a lawyer, get it notarized, make it legal. They'll come up with all the edge cases the internet can spit at you.

However: ""long time"", why not get married? In a legal sense, it's a shortcut to a lot of things like equity-sharing, plus hospital visitation rights, survivors' benefits, legal representation, etc. I get that some people don't want to be tied down, but you're trying to tie yourselves together via home equity, which is one of the hardest part to sort out in a divorce because of how intertwined it is. If you're going that far, you might as well go to the courthouse, because a $25 marriage license is less than what you'll pay a lawyer to get it right or in court costs when you get it it wrong without one."
PsychologicalCost8,"[Roth 401(k)'s are subject to RMDs](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-regarding-required-minimum-distributions#2). They can be relatively easily avoided by rolling them over to Roth IRA's, but if it's left as a Roth 401(k) into retirement it **does** have RMDs.

The IRS rules seem to say you [cannot take contributions out of a Roth 401(k)](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/retirement-plans-faqs-on-designated-roth-accounts#25) tax-free - just out of Roth IRA's. In the past (\~2016) it was possible to take withdrawals from a Roth 401(k) older than 5 years and have taxes pro-rated proportionally between contributions and earnings, but it's not clear to me if that's still the case beyond hardship.

The rules for Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k)s are not the identical, despite the shared name. They're named after a [Congressman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Roth), not a ruleset or method, so while similar, they're not the same."
PsychologicalCost8,"Personally, I took a middle ground - overpay the student loans substantially, but keep paying them to build the life-of-credit and on-time-payment history. It's a nuisance payment with less than 1% more interest than the savings rate Ally gives, there's not a huge penalty for not clearing it out immediately.

Since you're planning to relocate, what I'd suggest is divide the remaining balance by the paychecks you have left before moving if you can - just to have an artificial timeline as well as decrease your nonnegotiable expenses as you move to a higher CoL area."
PsychologicalCost8,"Good luck!

FWIW, the general advice is to save 15% of your gross annual income for retirement. At $63k, that'd be $9,450. If you can save closer to that than $3-5k you'll be better off / safer in the long run, regardless of investment method / choices / timing."
PsychologicalCost8,"Slightly off topic: Can you explain why the proposed changes are supposed to be a good thing?

Basically, I don't get why the plan to help people save for retirement is...to let them work longer (by increasing the contribution age limit from 70.5)? While simultaneously making it easier to take money out of restricted-use accounts (retirement and college savings) for unrelated expenses (childbirth and private school)?

I don't know enough about the specifics of Multi-Employer Plans to understand why they're being pushed.

I'm a bit confused about the incentives being added for annuities as well. I get that one of the major objections / problems with annuities is that they can stop paying the holder if the managing company (often an insurer) goes bankrupt, but how is this supposed to deal with that? And why are account-servicers supposed to be more interested in offering annuities because of that? There are other reasons not to like them (i.e. inflation pressure and CoL increases often inadequately matched by fixed payout increases)

The only suggestion I've seen under current debate that seems like a good idea is the National Retirement Plan, where each person has an account for all time and employers pay into them during the time of employment, but I totally get why that'd be insanely complicated to actually administer."
PsychologicalCost8,"Roth means you're making post-tax contributions, where traditional you were making pre-tax. You should use a Roth if you expect your tax bracket now to be lower than in retirement; traditional if the other way around.

Since you're 27, the answer to whether yours'll be lower or higher in retirement is a big fat **?** just because of how far away that is.

You're seeing more tax being paid because you're paying tax on more income - the traditional 401(k) deducted before tax reporting (essentially), so you paid taxes on (Income-Contribution); now you're paying taxes on (Income).

With IRA's, the advice tends to be go Roth, if only because Roth IRAs don't have Required Minimum Distributions. That isn't true of Roth 401(k)'s ((rollovers aside)), so the answer of which is more appropriate is somewhere between more nuanced and less clear. I've seen people on this subreddit arguing vociferously that high-earners (you) absolutely should go with each type.

NerdWallet [seems to recommend the Roth](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/roth-401k-vs-401k/) 401(k).

The best advice I've seen is along the lines of ""Diversify your tax situation in retirement, because you can't know in advance what's best""; since you're up against the Roth IRA contribution limit, in your case it may make the most sense to go with Roth 401(k) and Traditional IRA.

Frankly, this is a relatively personally-specific sort of question, and if you're really not sure you should go find a fee-only CFP / Fiduciary and pay them for an hour to get an answer about what you should do."
PsychologicalCost8,"Here:

|Gross Income|Pre-Tax Deductions|Taxable Income|24% Federal Tax Bracket|Post-Tax Deduction|Take-Home|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$105k|15% (($15,750))|$89,250|$21,420|0%|$67,830|
|$109k|0%|$109,000|$26,160|15% (($16,350))|$66,490|

This only considers federal taxes (where you're in the same bracket either way), so it's possible your raise moved you into a higher tax bracket at the state or local levels (as appropriate). Also disregarded bonuses, since you weren't terribly clear whether that's on this year's or last year's taxes or how that affects overall numbers.

Note that Taxable Income = Gross Income \* (1 - Pre-Tax Deductions)

Note that Take Home = Taxable Income - 24% Federal Tax Bracket - (Taxable Income \* Post-Tax Deduction)

So you're paying 24% on both the 15% you're not deducting pre-tax, which outweighs the $4k raise (less taxes thereon) by about $1340; there's also the factor that 15% of $109k is slightly larger than 15% of $105k.

These are approximate numbers, since I'm not taking into account the marginal rates lower than 24% on income below $77k and treating it as fully-taxed on all taxable income, which isn't true, but the difference is equal on both accounts. The lower take-home will hold.

So: They are only taxing your 15%, not their 4% match; but since your 15% is larger than it used to be and you're paying taxes on $20k more than you used to be, that $20k\*.24=$4800 and .15\*4000 (difference) = 600, $600 \* .24 = $144, so that's where you're seeing the $1340-ish come from: $4800+600+144 - 4000 (raise) = $1344 less coming home with you on the year.

Let me know if that's not clear. The numbers are right, I'm just not sure I'm explaining it well.

EDIT: Put actual numbers in deduction cells."
Bballwolf,"529 plan growth? How does a 529 plan grow? I keep seeing that it is a great way to grow money for a child's college, but how does it grow? Can somebody give me an example? Is this a good option for saving for a child's college?

Also I keep seeing about the fees involved for taking it out for non college related expenses. 10% doesn't sound that bad because it's just on the growth and not on my amount I put in. Why do I care about 10% of the money I never physically put in disappearing? I know very little about finances and investing if you can't tell, lol. "
Bballwolf,How does it grow through? Does it grow just like my Mass mutual pension? Could it lose 50% if the stock market crashes like in 2008? Is it a set rate at which it grows that won't change? I can't find the specifics. What did you mean price per share in the plan? I need to buy a for dummies book because I'm so confused on investing.

Bballwolf,"Hmm.  Sounds like bank of America might be something to check out. I just wish there was one near me. I don't like the idea of not having the option of going into a brick and mortar store if I needed to. Then again... I've never been inside an Amazon.

Bballwolf,"Yes I could just put $50 a week I to savings. I could put $20 a day I to savings if I wanted. The thing is, I don't. I'm not very good at consciously saving money. I'm not bad with money necessarily, but I'm not very good at taking my extra money and saving it. 

This is why I opted into my unions 5% vacation fund plan. 5% of my paycheck automatically goes into a vacation fund every week. I find it very useful to have an, albeit small, amount of money set aside each week. A lot of people I work with think it's stupid because they can just save the money themselves and don't want part of their paycheck missing. Also, a lot of people I work with are horribly broke and don't save any money. 

I'm one of those people who stink at saving money and love finding ways that force me to save money. I understand that I'm not very disciplined with money and I should be able to save it other ways. Different things work for different people. 

And saving a few pennies per transaction won't encourage me to spend money. I'm not one of those if you buy 2 and you will save 50% on the second one type of people if I only need 1 of an item. 

I acknowledge my shortcomings in money management and am actively working towards fixing them. I've also started a thing where I automatically put all the overtime I make straight into savings. If I can live off a 40 hour paycheck then I can save the extra. I plan on upping my vacation fund to 10% to save even more money.

Here's my info. 

Last year I made $37,000 because I had some overtime. This year it will actually be almost the exact same because although I might not have much overtime I will be getting a raise halfway through the year.

iroflmaowtf,"Over the years I worked for and with various companies, it would take you many years to get a 50% pay raise at your current company.

That being said, you should ask yourself if that income increase is what you want, if it is, then maybe try to get a raise at your current company?

If I were you, I’d take the raise immediately with a signed contract, it’s almost impossible for the current company to raise your pay by half, maybe 20ish%, but even that seems like a long stretch, the other company seems to help you even more with growth, life is short."

joelaw9,"To put that in the frame of the IRS ""We're not giving you interest for you choosing to overpay us"". After all, it's up to the individual to keep up with their taxes, how much they give or don't give, until there's an audit. "
joelaw9,"Step by step: Confirm she closed the account. Sit her down and confront her on the impossibility of her 'accidentally' using all of your information on the card. Tell her that you don't want it to happen again. Inform her that you've opened a Credit Karma (or some account like that) so that you'll get alerted when there's activity on your credit. Don't let her blow it off, pursue the conversation. Open said account.

Do all that and your relationship should survive fine and she'll be cowed and less likely to try similar antics in the future. *And* in the event of future identity theft, whether it's her or someone else, you'll be alerted."
joelaw9,"It's viable enough that there are businesses based on it. It's a scenario that can't hurt your mother as AU cards, and replacements, are always sent to the primary account holder's address, so your cousin can't ever use it. Your cousin will get the entire line of credit history, so it'll likely boost her score as she suggests.

The one potential negative is that your mother and cousin's credit history would now be linked, so there's potential for debt collectors that are after your cousin contacting your mom. But they can't do anything to her, so it's a very minor negative. "
joelaw9,"If your local bank has rejected you then it's time to wait. If part of your problem credit history is missed payments then it would indeed help to get multiple lines of credit, but you're pretty low on options right now. Wait six months or so, use your card enough to get a statement and pay it off in full, try again at capital one or your local bank then."
joelaw9,Disputing with the collections agency is a fool's errand. They have bought the debt from the original source for less than the debt is valued at and are trying to turn a profit. It's not their concern whether it's valid or not. Go through either the credit bureaus or the original company.
joelaw9,"I paid the original company for one and the collection agency for another, one remains on the credit reports but is closed, the other got removed. I meant 'eliminate' as in paying them, at the time I wasn't aware that they could take them off entirely."
joelaw9,"After it hits your credit report it should improve your credit. It means a bank decided to give you a line of credit, which increases your trustworthiness to other lenders.

As an aside ""in full"" generally means settling a debt, not meeting the minimum payment."
joelaw9,"My credit score went from 520 to 700 in under a year via getting two secured credit cards, Capital One and a local bank card with an annual fee, and using them a small amount every month and paying them off fully. 8 months or so after opening and paying regularly on both of these cards I opened 2 more unsecured cards and the local bank card graduated to unsecured, ending with a 700 credit score by the year mark.

Using credit responsibly and eliminating collections is all you have to do."
joelaw9,"It sounds like the primary issue here is that they aren't going through you to take money for bills or whatever. Even if you completely roll over every time they guilt trip you, they should have to do so instead of just bypassing you entirely and withdrawing money from your account. 

Ideally, after opening your own account and depositing money into it, you can determine with them how much of your check should go to the household. If they *are* actually going to pay you back later, then you need to find out how and when. "
joelaw9,"You are not obligated to refund anyone, all backers know the risk when they back a project.

If you still want to do this then putting it on a credit card is the worst option. Your parents are stupid. Outright. 

With that out of the way,  your ""best"" bet sounds like a personal loan from a bank. If your credit isn't terrible it'll be at a relatively low interest that you can work on paying back, and the entire thing is put behind you as far as personal responsibility goes. You don't want this to be dragged out for years to come as you individually refund people from your paycheck and deal with the massive headache that comes with it. 

With that out of the way, the correct advice is ""put it behind you"". You owe no financial obligation and the backers know that what they back may not pan out. They were investors and the endeavor failed due to circumstances out of your control, investors don't always get their value back out of their investment. Listen to everyone else here and put it behind you. And whatever you do, don't put it on a fucking 28% APR credit card or 299% payday loan or some stupid shit like that. "

An example would be investing in ABBV which would push that 2.2% up to 5.4% or rather $405 a month. That's good for half of the rent in a lot of places as I understand it.

Generally people on PF scoff at cash flow arguments and go for maximum efficiency. So saying that that's how it is 'here' is incorrect even if it's correct generally on Reddit. Ramsey is routinely mocked 'here'."
joelaw9,"\- **Should I be paying more towards...** Always build your emergency fund first, as you've been doing. It's most important that you have a cushion in case of emergency medical issues or sudden unemployment. Following that I would focus on the student loan since you're already matching on your 401k and HSA. Reducing debts frees more of your income and reduces the burdens on you. You'll be in a safer place if a catastrophic event happens, and be able to do more of what you want. This is balanced against how powerful your desire for property is.

\- **What are some recommendations...** Aside from the obvious like cutting out entertainment and Netflix and the like, the biggest cost cutter would be what you're already doing: looking for a job closer to home. Judging from your bills it looks like you'd stand to save between 100 and 300 a month just from that. In the mean time, it's a good talking point for any raise talks with your current boss.

\-  **Any other tips about planning..**

It looks like you have your financial situation well in hand to be frank. You know what money is coming in, what money is going out, what is currently reliable, and what might be viable in the future without overcommiting. Some notes:

\- When your boyfriend becomes employed again he needs to start on his 401k immediately, even if his employer has a delay on matching.

\- Your boyfriend needs to start establishing his credit now, even if he plans on just being a house husband. If you're both signing for the home, both of your credits affects your mortgage.

\- If you're not estimating getting a house within the next year, I would recommend growing your credit out as well with another card or two. Between a couple well-handled credit cards and on-time loan payments your credit score, and thus mortgage interest, should be good."
joelaw9,"&gt;  I can only assume my parents did it when I was a child. 

There's no reason to assume that. It could be a misfiling from someone of a similar name or fraud. Ask your parents and in the meantime contact the credit companies to contest it."
joelaw9,Roll it over to an IRA. You'll then have an account already set up for if/when you leave your current job and need to roll your current 401k into an IRA. It also gives you 9k that isn't at the behest of the oddball rules of your company 401k.
joelaw9,"Having different debt actually increases your credit score as it means you have experience with the different kinds of debt. Your best bet is to open a couple credit cards so that they can age while you're in college and build up a good on time payment base.

On the other hand, there's nothing preventing you from paying on the student loan, thus reducing the total  you have to pay in interest in the long run, while having credit cards. This is a fiscally responsible decision, but doesn't affect your credit score to any significant extent."
joelaw9,"Cash back rewards are very nice. If you put your $750 rent through a 2% cashback on all purchases card then you get $15 back a month. 4% on gas purchases gives you $7.20. It's already getting to the point where making your credit more robust for future loans and mortgages is paying your smaller bills as well. Credit cards used responsibly are a great tool to boost your fiscal well being and move you towards your goals. Just make sure you read up on the advice in the sidebar, research any cards you're interested in, and always pay in full.

Good luck!"
joelaw9,"There is no one credit score. There's three credit bureau and dozens of scoring algorithms.

The different algorithms that give different credit factors different weight. Credit Karma is a good indicator of how your score is trending and will alert you to fraudulent activity, but it's not necessarily the same number lenders will get."
beaspatrolman,"The IRS needs to allow time for the employer to deliver the w2. Once that time period hits they will send a letter to you and the employer. The letter will tell the employer to send the w2 directly to you. If you don’t get it, you can file with a substitute w2 (estimated earnings). "
beaspatrolman,"If she called you an employee and still wants to issue you a 1099....probably an issue. The link below is a publication on how to tell if you’d be an employee or not. 

https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1779.pdf 

You can always file a form SS8 but it takes like 6 months to determine if you are an employee or contractor. "
beaspatrolman,"There are several things you can do. I’m assuming you’re in the US because you have a SSN. Go to IRS.gov and type in identity theft in the search box, it will give you a list of government agencies to contact as well as the credit bureau numbers and so forth. "
beaspatrolman,"Are you looking at the tax rates for 2018 or 2019? 

2018 federal withholding rates went down. Go to IRS.gov and check the withholding calculator and that will let you know about going forward, however this will not work for your 2018 taxes. "
beaspatrolman,"I would suggest to keep it at 15% as long as you can because as you get older, you will have more bills to pay. Personally I do about 10% but that’s split between Roth and let’s just call it a 401K. 

Also I would hope that you have a 6-8 month emergency savings just Incase something happens. "
beaspatrolman,You can setup a payment plan or you can also look into what’s called an offer in compromise on Irs.gov. The offer in compromise is basically those commercials you see about settling tax debt for pennies on the dollar...but you can do it yourself vs paying someone to do it for you. 
beaspatrolman,"Traditionally your score lowers when you opens new line however increasing available credit is a good thing as long as the utilization does not also increase. You may have a hit at first but if you go about it the right way, it’ll level out. "
beaspatrolman,Some used car dealerships actually specialize in people with bad credit. A friend of mine bought a car from a place that installed some device in her car that would basically immobilize the vehicle if you are late on your payment. You may be able to look into something like that. 
beaspatrolman,"Tax reform changed a number of things. So throughout the year your paychecks should have been slightly bigger which is part of the reason your refund is smaller. 
It also depends on if you itemize as well. 
I am actually being taxed at a lower rate than in the past. "
beaspatrolman,"The IRS typically has nothing to do with your federal withholding, that’s only on your company. I wouldn’t worry about it too much. 

The change of being married vs single is just federal withholding per pay. So depending on what you put, you will probably get a larger refund. "
beaspatrolman,"Based on income level, you can only handle so much debt. When you go to get a mortgage, the less you have to pay, the better it would be for you. I suggest that you talk to a bank and get a pre-approval and give them what you’re paying now and what you’ll get with a refinanced loan.  

Pre-approval without using your SSN. "
beaspatrolman,I am assuming that you filled out a corrected W-4 with your employer but the only impact on your taxes is that you would probably have more federal taxes withheld over the course of the year. Some people leave their W-4s alone after getting married anyway. 
beaspatrolman,"You will be given a 1099-misc (miscellaneous) from your employer. As a contractor you are responsible for paying both the employee and employer share of taxes....you’ll need to file a schedule C and schedule SE (names may have changed this year with tax reform). I would check with the other workers to see if they are also contracted and not employees. 

The above is only for Federal US taxes. "
beaspatrolman,There are several high yield savings accounts around 2% and have been increasing. Some of these online accounts have lower term cd rates that are also not bad. Right now interest rates seem to be rising so I wouldn’t lock up all of your available funds into a CD...just my 2 cents. 
beaspatrolman,"You technically do not need to have him talk to one of those “Irs problems call blah blah” because everything they can do, so can your relative.  Sounds like they may want to discuss being put into currently not collectible however they would probably need to potentially have some documentation for the IRS collections department. 

Also it has to be more recent than those tax years so maybe you do not know everything about the balance due. You can go onto the IRS website to request account transcripts. "
Marquis77,"Your advice still doesn’t hold water. I shouldn’t buy a home on the chance that I might lose my job? Nobody would ever buy a home. 

The 30% rule is the way to go here. And they have pretty substantial savings. "
Marquis77,"I don't think this is really reasonable. The job market is ever-changing, and if they're currently making 240k/yr then it's not a stretch to assume that if one or both lost their jobs, they could A) collect unemployment to float for a short time and B) become employed again fairly soon at a similar rate of pay."

Marquis77,"For now, OP, I wouldn't even worry about the IRA. Just pay off all debts and then put the rest into savings. Take time to decompress, to process, to grieve if you need to. If not, be there for family who are.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you're ready to tackle this with a clear head, sit down and write out a list of priorities, starting with the biggest ones. Job, retirement goals, etc. Once you start the list, I think that the important stuff, and how this money can help you reach those goals, will start to coalesce."
Marquis77,"Fuck no. Treat recruiters like your weird alcoholic uncle. He calls you when he wants something. Listen politely, don’t share any info about what’s going on in your life, and maybe one day he might have something that could help you out. But don’t bet on it. "
Marquis77,"First, verify the debt against your own bank records. If you do indeed owe, next verify that they collections company is the sole owner of the debt as opposed to working with / on behalf of the trash company. Before paying anything, get it in writing that this is the last and only payment you need to make to the trash company. Once that’s all done, pay and move on. Your credit will bounce back."
Marquis77,"For now, while still in school, save that money in an interest bearing savings account such as at a credit union.

&amp;#x200B;

When you finish school and have a regular income, budget first. Create an emergency fund. Then throw everything from your FAFSA grants &amp; loans at your student loans. Tackling the highest interest loan first will result in better net gains (through tackling loans with compounding interest) vs investing it in the stock market."
XrayMomma,"Have you ever heard of YNAB? It’s a budget app/software that is really helpful for determining how you should be spending your income. You can add your own goals, like paying off credit cards, and it can help you stay on track. There are lots of helpful YouTube videos and YNAB usually offers a free trial. 
Good luck!"
XrayMomma,"He may have co-signed for the money, but who’s going to pay it back? If that person is going to be you, then keep the money. He’ll live. He might be mad about it, but that’s his problem. You’re not responsible for how he handles the reality of the situation. Best of luck!!"
XrayMomma,"Read up on the snowball method. It’s where you throw as much money as possible at your debt with the lowest balance, while making minimum payments on the others. Then when the small one is paid off, you’ll put all that money towards the next balance, along with the minimum that you were previously paying. 
That is supposed to help keep you motivated because you’ll see your debt shrinking and want to keep at it. I hope you find something that works for you! "
XrayMomma,"That’s not how it works. It’s best to make your payment as early in the billing cycle as possible to cut down on the interest you’ll pay. If you’re not paying your balance in full every month, that is. 

Splitting your payment in half won’t help reduce interest as much. Won’t do anything for your score. "
XrayMomma,Be careful looking at that $60 a month- that’s probably an interest only payment. Meaning you will pay that forever and the loan balance will never change. There’s no way you’re paying down principle on a $28k loan at only $60 a month. Also $5k closing costs seems way too high. 
XrayMomma,"I think the first step in debt consolidation is to go into default. That’s what I’ve read, anyway. It’s really not a good option for people who aren’t already behind on payments. It doesn’t sound like a good idea anyway. 

I don’t think she’s getting scammed, but I do think she’s getting bad advice from these people."
XrayMomma,"From what I’ve read, the reason behind clearing out the lowest balance first is purely for the emotional payoff and motivation to continue. Since the lowest balance was $350, that seems like a good place to start. But anything is better than more debt, or new debt. 
OP, the best advice I can give is go through your past spending and see where you’re wasting- dining out, clothes, etc and get rid of that. It’ll suck for a while but it’s worth it."
XrayMomma,"Would the sibling living with you quality for any government assistance such as SSI or food stamps? I’m not sure if that could be counted as income on a mortgage, but it may help you both with renting in the short term. 

I think a 70k house is reasonably affordable, especially since you have help with the down payment and the closing costs. If you’re eligible to bank with a credit union, get an account set up ASAP (if you don’t already have one) and speak to a mortgage lender there. They offer the best guidance, and most credit unions have good rates and don’t require PMI. 

Best of luck to you. "
XrayMomma,"It takes some getting used to. But basically, your bills aren’t covered until you actually have the money to pay them. 

Say your car payment is $400, due on the 15th, but you get paid on the 10th... you know you’re using that check for the car payment, but you don’t technically have it yet. So you won’t fund that budget line until the money is in the bank. 

Hope that helps. There’s also a YNAB section on here that has some better explanations. There’s some great info on YouTube as well. "
XrayMomma,"Tax/College tuition question I have a son in college who uses a combination of student loans and our/his income to pay tuition. We (his dad and I) claim him on our taxes because we make more money. My question is this- when we get the 1098, do we claim the amount on that form or the amount we actually paid out of pocket? The 1098 includes the tuition charged, but with the loans we didn’t actually pay that much. I always do our taxes, so I just want to make sure they’re correct. 
Thanks in advance!!!

Also please let me know if I should post this somewhere else. "
XrayMomma,"Ameriprise did the same thing to me, but they gave me three days after they overnighted the check for the payout. It was a little bit of an inconvenience, but not that bad. My policy gives me $30/day for up to 30 days, but they said since the car was totaled and the settlement reached, I had to turn the rental in within 3 days or pay out of pocket. So it’s not unheard of, but I don’t understand it either. Sorry about your car tho!!"
XrayMomma,"You may also need deposits for utilities. These can be several hundred each, depending on the company. Just do your best to estimate your monthly expenses and have a few months saved up prior to your move- separate from your current savings. I think you’ll be fine, financially. It may be good for you to be on your own and it might be good for your father as well. Best of luck! "
XrayMomma,"I see your wife’s point, and it makes perfect sense on paper. You’ll have the option to invest your money as you choose, and then pay your taxes all at one time. If you’re disciplined enough to put the money aside every pay period and not spend it, then go for it. I’m not disciplined enough to do that. I’d find myself with a bigass tax bill in April, and I’d have already spent the money throughout the year. 

It’s all about you and your wife, and whether or not you can keep up with what you should be withholding. "
XrayMomma,"Download the realtor app and start looking. If there’s a rental shortage, there’s probably a shortage of available homes for sale as well. Please don’t buy something you’ll hate in a year though!! Best of luck to you, I know this is stressful. "
XrayMomma,"My hubby and I rented our home from his parents for two years, and they sold it to us for what they paid for it. It was a small home, 3 bed 1 bath that needed work. We bought it, did work over time, and lived there for 16 years total. I’m so grateful that we were able to do that, it was the best decision we could have made. 

It’s a great opportunity, and I think you should go for it. "
XrayMomma,"Can you afford the mortgage and taxes and insurance if your parents are not able to pay? Worst case scenario, if you own the house you’ll have to pay for the house.
Sounds like you’re leaning towards buying the house for your parents. If that’s the case, you should consider it a rental and have your parents pay you rent, as another poster suggested. "
XrayMomma,"I use Ally for my emergency fund and vacation savings. If I have an actual emergency, I plan to just use my credit card and pay it back with the money from the Ally account. This gives me the best interest rate, and I don’t see that money when I’m paying bills or balancing my accounts. Out of sight, out of mind. "
XrayMomma,"Have the money orders refunded. Since you have the copies, it shouldn’t be a problem. The directions are on the back of the money orders or the stubs. 

There may be a fee for that, but it’s better than being out $5500.

Edit: assuming the money orders haven’t been cashed...."
Evariste-Lovelace,"They don’t have to take my path. Dakota State University offers several bachelors online. That’s where I’m doing my CS degree. Even if they don’t work the jobs I worked, doing online frees up ALOT of time to where you can work more hours or find full time jobs. 

I know people who went straight to a university against my advice for CC and living on campus getting in debt in 1 semester more than my entire 2 years of CC cost. Many people make stupid choices and put themselves in debt and cry about it.

Dakota is charging me out of school tuition but it’s less than my local university surprisingly."
Evariste-Lovelace,It's a conventional loan so 5% is good enough. I am getting PMI insurance; (A) says $57 (estimate) and (B) says $85 (estimate). The PMI goes away if we reach 20% of the loan since it's a conventional loan; so it doesn't stay the whole time.
Evariste-Lovelace,"Oh so it's prepaid interest really to get it down to 4.2%; I didn't think about it like that.

So if I'm paying it off in less than 8 years than 4.2% isn't worth it? That's what you mean by short changing myself right."
Evariste-Lovelace,"Yes this is my first time buying a home and my parents have never owned one; always rented and then they divorced. So I want this to be the go-to house for our family, as in even if we were to move out, my parents can stay in it."
Evariste-Lovelace,"It’s possible, I can. But a lot of people choose to screw themselves out of money or high tuition by living in dorms or choosing to go physically to school rather than take the most online classes they can. If you do more online, you have more time to work.

Back in 2017 when I started my CS degree, I was working in California for $78K a year but it was only for the summer. That was enough to pay my school balances. Since I was online, I was saving a lot of money by not living on campus or a dorm, etc. I wouldn’t have been working there if I was going to the school physically. I wouldn’t be able to.

Then when I came back home, I got a job as a software engineer. I could still afford to pay off my school balances because again, I was all online. No parking fee BS, no dorm fees, etc. if I didn’t do online, I wouldn’t have gotten that software job because I wouldn’t have time since it’s 40 hours 9-5 job.

I know not everyone can get a high paying job but many people just don’t think smart. Don’t live on campus, don’t go to a school far from home, take as many online if possible. Do community first. You free up more time to work and save money by not paying the high ass rent they charge for dorms. But people just rather be stupid, get high in debt going to a school far away, get charged up the ass for dorms repeatedly, waste gas going to school back and forth, etc.
"
t3hd0n,"20k is not a ""reliable used car"" but a splurge, I just got a 2017 Hyundai accent for 10k.

Use interest calculators to find where you'll save the most money on your debt, you might find it better to take the money and save it, and make auto payments form that account is better. I'm guessing it's going to be in your favor to pay off the cards, this is more targeted at your mortgage and car loan.

Put the rest away, besides the 15k. Don't touch the 15k either except for real emergencies. You got yourself into 18k in credit card debt, your goal is stay within your means. Add a good chunk into your own retirement and put the rest in long term savings.

Edit: number typo"
t3hd0n,"On the report there is listed who owns your debt. Your discussion needs to include them and not Comcast. Ask them for proof of ownership, do not say you owe anything, as that will validate their claim. 

Either the debt will be dropped or it'll show the debt is over 7 years old and you can get it it off your report with proof it's over 7 years old."
t3hd0n,"what kind of debt is this? a pay for delete can only happen until they send it to collections, since collections just want to make a little money off the debt they bought off the original creditor.

t3hd0n,"beauty care and personal care should be its own budget. i had them lumped in together at one point cause i was lazy for this reason, but the $ i had for it reflected it. you can start with ""grocery"" be the average you spend at grocery stores per month (and trying to lower it a little at a time if needed), and in future purchases split the transition into categories to figure out your realistic spending on those categories."
t3hd0n,"you still didn't say if the expenses of 277000 is ""normal"" and its currently triple ($831000) or if expenses used to be $92,333 and the number you gave IS the triple. i'm going assume you mean the 277k is triple since you'd be so much farther in the hole if our expenses were huge.

&gt;Expenses were triple because the trucks got flooded

that sounds like you should have insurance for that, and if they're causing another $184,667 yearly they need to be written off. they need to have an accountant really, as this kind of stuff can be written off to relieve taxes when there are losses."
t3hd0n,"talk to your insurance. also, care centers, hospitals, etc are not going to be experts in your specific health insurance. don't let them talk you into something you know your insurance doesn't cover. heres a good post to go over as well:

for everything else, get financial assistance. food stamps, snap, etc. your dad needs to walk your mom through bills, or at least list them down. he might be committing financial abuse if he refuses."
t3hd0n,"if you're working about the same as last year, give them last year as an estimate for this year. if you make more, great. once you figure out a better projection update them asap.

t3hd0n,"&gt; Roth 401k

I mentioned opening your own roth IRA so you could put in your own deposits with freelance money. if you're going to be taking more out of your company paycheck it might be better to up the contribution to your 401k instead.

&gt;Mostly just concerned about tying up too much cash when I'm not sure what my expenses will look like 6 months from now.

isn't that always the case though? you're rent is going to increase to 1500, and factor in the one time payment of deposit and last months rent. your utilities will approximately double. 

get your emergency money up to the new budget and you should be fine. if something happens and you start bleeding money from there, you'll have plenty of time to readjust. 

now would be a good time to check the return rate of your savings. you can get a high (2.20%apy) interest savings fairly easily right now. that would be a good place to put the extra income from the CC payments. it will probably take a little longer to get to you, but i'm talking days instead of weeks."
startupdojo,"If it's a legit giftcard, the guy can just buy numerous $100 gift cards and stack them.  I don't know how much sales volume there is for all these giftcards on ebay, but there are certainly 3rd party sites that can facilitate this.  

Considering the amount of time people spend figuring out the best 1%-3% credit card, I would not be surprised at all if people saved more money buying giftcards.  It's a better /personal finance/ tip than most.  "
startupdojo,"Unless you spend a ton of money, you probably don't  realize how little you will get in mile rewards.

startupdojo,"Leases = bad deal.
Dealerships = bad deal.

These are businesses and their goal is to make as much money off of you as they can.  If you are expecting a good deal from either,  you are expecting too much.   "
startupdojo,"When you apply for a mortgage, your bike loan will be a small negative influence anyway.  

Unless you plan to find a house and buy it within with the next 4 months, 4 month delay does not affect the bottom line much, right?

Most people are not complete degenerates that get buried in debt.  It is mostly a question of increasing your risk, your monthly commitments,  and paying interest/frees on top of that.  It is not a death spiral for vast majority and it won't be for you either - it is just a bad financial decision.  "
startupdojo,"Your rationale of saving for 4 months putting you at season end does not make much sense to me.  Why not pay cash right now AND save for 4 months so that your nestegg goes back to normal?  

It just seems like you are trying to rationalize debt.  No matter how favorable the terms, few people can effectively game these systems and chances are good you get screwed on interest or fees or fineprint - or all three.  

Debt is a lifestyle and once you go down this path you are playing with fire.  It will most likely be fine, but there is no upside potential, only downside potential.  This is how debt lifestyle starts.  "
startupdojo,"It depends how much the certainty of this payoff is worth to you.  Chances are good you will make more if you hold, no one contacts former employees after 2 years just out of gratefulness.   But you also probably know that there are ways they can dilute you into nothing if they really want to.  "
startupdojo,"Corporations rarely have a reason to just go after people.  Not only is corporate retainer high, bad publicity has costs as well.  And in the end, they can win nothing substantial.   

It is often the opposite.  If an individual has a good case, lawyers come out of the woodward willing to work for free in hopes of getting a big pay day when damages get awarded.  Lawyers are literally advertising on TV looking for plaintiffs.  Have you seen these ads?  Corporations have money and are willing to settle even if they would likely win.  They are an attractive target.  

"
startupdojo,"You think there was no technology a 100 years ago or something?  Everything is more mature compared to 20 years ago but that doesn't mean it was new.  New tech is always around the corner, in every industry.  Tech is more than just internet stocks. "
startupdojo,"The above is not true at all.  Nonprofit jobs can pay very well.  The question comes down to supply and demand.  Im in DC and we have a glut of ivy league Phds/etc competing for the same desirable jobs which results in low pay.  

Supply and demand.  If your gf has a very specific skill that makes her involuble to the company, she will be in good position to negotiate.  If it's just a question of having a good degree/etc, that is not enough.   But it depends on competitive it is.  Supply and demand.  "
startupdojo,By far the most important thing here is to make sure your school doesn't take most of it next year when they see you have 4k.  Financial aid consideration is the biggest factor here.  See if putting it in 401k or something else will shelter this money and not be touched by the school.
startupdojo,"$2500 is not much but it doesn't matter anyway.  By far, your number 1 priority right now is to set yourself up for good job offers when you graduate.  Internships, networking, etc are what matters.  

25-30k is the price of a midrange Toyota.  If you get a good job it will be pretty inconsequential.   If you don't get a good job, it will be a burden.  So...  work on your number 1 priority."
bronkscottema,"If you are talking to recruiters, realize that one they might be using you to get your references for their more senior openings. They make money of placing people. They might be trying to build a relationship with you for possible future postings. 
Like others have said just say I want x amount. They will always respond with “that sounds good” whether they mean it or not. You determine what is a lateral move not them. And whatever number they offer. Make sure that is close to your high dollar. Cause that is usually going to be starting number.  They won’t offer more. Actually what I would do is ask for the job description, and then use websites like Glassdoor or dice to see what the company pays or what is average in your city. "
bronkscottema,"You pay taxes on every paycheck. I doubt you’d get any refund if it all. So use a free tax software. For example TurboTax online. Fill out the web form, whatever TurboTax tries to sell don’t buy it. The feds aren’t coming after you. If you get a refund sweet. If you don’t o well. "

On to question portion. What kind of loans are they? Subsidized or un-sub? Can you refinance? Parent plus? Also does your loan company offer income based repayment plans? I know it’s not ideal, but it would hopefully open up your financial flexibility. "
bronkscottema,"No!!!!!!!! It’s easier to get loans when you’re less employed or really stable. In fact the ease of it is based on income to dependents! She could be in line for a pell grant which is free money. And loans will be easier to get and they won’t be ridiculously priced. The only thing I will say is just because a private school is 30k a year plus, most of them offer a half scholarship for having a b average and an above average SAT/ACT score."
bronkscottema,Either you’ve had the worst car luck ever or you’ve just always had disposable income. I had 4 cars that were all 1k-2k for 6 years and I had one 12k for 3 years before it fell apart. Tell me which one is better? 
bronkscottema,"Welp I’ll try to be a help here. Buy it and drive it until the ground when the lease payment is up. That will save you for overage fees. 

Or trade it now, take the negative equity on your next loan. Get gap insurance for sure. Live and learn. "
bronkscottema,"Oof very similar situation here, my wife left me for some guys at work. Been together for 7 years though. Anywho, the only thing I can think of, if her name is on the loan, she is just as liable as you to pay it off. I’m here if you need to talk OP."
hTown346,"You will need to respond to the IRS letter telling them that the form was a duplicate and that you disagree with the assessment and penalty. It may mean the company double deducted on accident or it may not, but it’s too late for them to fix it for you.

You will need to respond to the IRS. The company can not make it right for you anymore. I would attach both forms indicating it was a duplicate and any other proof you may have of only one payment. You can mention the company is looking into it but that means nothing to them. 

Mail that back and then await their response. The penalty will be erased if you don’t owe any additional tax."
hTown346,Life advice from me: with that blank check do NOT tell them the amount you are approved up to. They will ask 6 different ways to pry it out of you. They want the max they can get outta you and knowing what you’re approved for is the start.
hTown346,"Depends on what reason and who eats the loss. Up to 60 days usually. 

“Most ACH return codes are received by the ODFI or RDFI two to three business days after the transaction was originated. However, other codes—like an R07 and R10—may be filed up to 60 days later (on behalf of a consumer bank account) after the transaction was originated”"
hTown346,"You could have student loans you didn’t know about. The reason they’re marked as paid previously could’ve been because they were in deferment while in school. They don’t report anything bad during that period. 

If these loans are federal: You need to use the NSLDS to see who/what/when/where. The website is nslds.ed.gov. The Nation Student Loan Data System is the official system that will tell you when it was taken and who the servicer is. Navient aka former Sallie Mae is a big one of the servicers. 

If these loans are private: you need to pull a credit report and take that account number and call Navient.

Student Loans are very hard to accidentally get. It is a long process and you have to sign a promissory note. Odds are your financial aid  package for school had some type of loan in it that you may not have realized."
hTown346,"Pull an IRS transcript. It’ll show the information provided by your W2’s (Wage and Income Transcript). Info is available up to 10 years back. If your wage and income transcript shows the 15k...Arizona is most likely correct in trying to collect the tax.

Edit: sorry the other transcript I mentioned (tax return) is only current year plus 3 prior. Wage is available for 10 though.

You can get a paper copy of your files return by filing Form 4506. It’s $50 and goes back 7 years for form 1040."
hTown346,"Internally, they’ve reached a decision as to why they won’t extend you credit. Unfortunately for you, they don’t have to explain it in full detail (that’s a company secret). They only have to provide you the factors and information they used, which was your credit score.

Their computer system is satisfied that $3,500 is your maximum expose to the organization. I am willing to bet that 3 late payments over a 7 year history is too much for them, especially if those late payments were with them specifically. 

Your best bet is to try a card elsewhere. It’s nothing personal, it’s business. USAA has become stricter as they opened up membership in the past few years, and they know they’ve lost their touch so they have publicly said they are working to become better."
hTown346,"If you use Chase’s online BillPay to issue the check (or their Chase Liquid prepaid) they subtract the money immediately before they mail the check.

The liquid product doesn’t allow for a checkbook though. You put in who to mail the check to online, they deduct the $ and mail. "
hTown346,"Difference between certified mail and registered mail? Registered mail travels in locked bags with strict supervision and key control.

Certified mail is legally accepted proof of mailing. It’ll make it to the IRS. They don’t try once and then immediately return it."
hTown346,"Bankruptcy isn’t going to do much for you. Plus what you spend flying back and showing up to court...you might as well just pay it back.

Is that parentplus loan yours, as in you are the parent?  With 95k...unless you’re making a ton of money you’re probably better off having them pay the minimum and wait it out until death honestly. 

But anyways back to your question: no, I don’t think bankruptcy will do anything for your situation."
hTown346,"Cool stuff.

The relocation $ is usually withheld as a bonus wage in my experience, so 22% federal, 6.2% Social Security and 1.45% Medicare + any state &amp; city tax withholding. I think you’re missing the NYC tax? Unless you’re adding it to the state and saying it’s blended 9%.

You figure out the real tax rate when you do your return. Some companies gross it up for taxes, but I don’t know if your bank will.

You’re probably going to need to live in Brooklyn with roommates, but I wouldn’t worry too much about that since you’ll literally be at work all day. Have some friends that do it and just jump on the train. Hopefully you’re not taking a car, right? 

Best of luck to you!

"
hTown346,"Do you value your retirement? A 401k save taxes today and grows until retirement. 

I generally think a Roth should come after contributing to a 401k, but it depends on your wage bracket and where you think you’ll be in retirement."
hTown346,"If you feel you can take the deduction, you can claim it on your return, attach a statement and file via mail, and await the IRS to contact you. They’ll do some matching against forms they have, notice the inconsistency and either send you a letter or you’ll never hear from them.

As to how the tax code should handle this, I honesty don’t know. It’s an interesting situation. In a private letter ruling years back, the IRS says that a cash rebate paid to a buyer of property at or after closing is an adjustment in the price, and is therefore not taxable income to the buyer."
hTown346,"You’re welcome. Last piece of advice, mail your response back certified mail, return receipt requested and keep it. Also, make a copy of what you send them. Most people don’t do this. If it never makes it, a copy is key. "
hTown346,"So if you asking if ACH’s cost the bank $, yes, they pay for each transaction. Usually it’s a fraction of a penny. Wires usually are in the dollar range. So while it does cost them, it’s no where near the mark up they push to consumers.

You can initiate an ACH pull from Ally to take from your US Bank account. In that case, Ally is paying the fee for the ACH transaction. "
hTown346,"If you were technically an employee from IRS guidelines then they can have problems. It doesn’t help you on the federal tax side since nothing was withheld, but it would help you on the SS and Medicare tax side.

All I’ll say is this: be prepared to lose your job if you file the IRS form disputing your classification as a 1099 employee. Most states are at-will employment."
hTown346,"Have you tried a better.com mortgage? Or SoFi mortgage? Better does the 3% down and I think SoFi only does a 10% down one. Worth checking.

I think the real question is how you’re making so much money and buying a house but don’t have savings. "

hTown346,"Depends on the type of plan (marketplace, employer sponsored, etc) but you have appeal rights. Was this test medically necessary? BCBS has “medical policy” set by their doctors and researchers which says what they cover and under what circumstances. You’ll need to appeal if you believe it should be covered. Look on the explanation of benefits they sent showing the denial for more details on how appeals work. They’re required to tell you how to appeal their decision (usually writing a letter)"
hTown346,"Assuming your employer counted it as a supplemental wage, it is withheld at the following:

22% federal

ThisTimeLessCrying,"Equity in a private company is risky because it's illiquid.  The company either has to go public (via IPO or other route) or be bought for cash (or with shares from a public company).  I don't know anything about this company, and a glance at its crunchbase page doesn't fill me with a ton of confidence (no apparent money from investors who will force a liquidity event at some point.)

Maybe reach out to some current and ex-employees?  Check linkedin to get a sense for turnover.  If it looks high then that's a real red flag...  though paying contractors in equity with no cash is already a red flag in my book."
ThisTimeLessCrying,"It looks like you're about breakeven with renting on a month-to-month basis.  What you don't mention in your assessment is tax advantages of owning - you can deduct the mortgage interest and taxes that you pay on your condo on your taxes.  That's (ballpark) $17k per year that you can deduct from your income, which depending on your tax bracket will probably save you $4-5k in taxes per year.  

Also, there's the behavioral economics dimension to it -- most people find it easier to ""save"" money by building equity than they do putting cash aside not touching it.  Buying a condo now will likely make buying a better place easier in the future (assuming you don't overpay, you think the market is healthy, and expect your income to increase over time.)  "
ThisTimeLessCrying,"A few thoughts - 

* You might look at some of the robo-advisor services (e.g. betterment) which can help with rebalancing.  It's not a huge benefit but should help you eek out a few more % over the long term
* Looks like you're portfolio is 100% US stocks?  Might diversity a portion of your portfolio with international, and with bonds
* There are financial advisers you can hire for on-going or one-time advice.  Could be good to get a 'pro' to look at your overall situation just to be sure there's nothing your missing (check the certified financial planner site for a list of people in your area.)"
ThisTimeLessCrying,"Your post is missing the most important info:  what is the interest rate on the various loans?  You should pay down your highest interest rate loans first, which are almost credit cards.  Credit cards are an incredibly expensive way of borrowing money and should be avoided at all costs (well north of 20% interest rates typically).  If you have savings you should seriously consider paying off the full credit card balance (and continue to pay off full balance each month.)

The auto loan is likely more in the 5-8% range, and if you're almost at the end of the loan, that means the majority of your monthly payment is going to principle with very little to interest.  Assuming you have a decent rate, there is no rush to pay this off."
ThisTimeLessCrying,"For your tax question, definitely talk to a CPA - very straightforward question for an expert.  It sounds like you'd be better off submitting and itemized deduction since you'd be eligible to deduct more than than the standard $12k for single filers.

For the ""pay more each month than the mortgage"" - I think you're asking about paying down your mortgage faster than you need to?  I think this would only make sense if you're stuck paying PMI since you put down less than 20%.  Once you're rid of PMI, you're better off sticking any excess money in index funds - the advantage is that the money is much more liquid in case you need it, plus you also get a bit of diversification beyond the SoCal real estate market

ThisTimeLessCrying,"Bear in mind that you'll get $300 off your travel expenses, so the $450 is actually $150.  You don't haev to do anything fancy to redeem - you just buy a ticket on, say, United and it gives you a $300 credit on your statement.  

Plus if you don't have Global Entry or TSA Pre, the card will give you a $100 credit for those too (so down to $50 cost)

Plus as someone else said, you can cancel after the first year.

That said, there is the Chase Sapphire Reserve card that gets some of the same benefits, but is only $95/yr.  Check out some of the points sites (I like thepointsguy the best, but they're all pretty good) for a range of options (including no fee cards)"
ThisTimeLessCrying,"Potential flaw in your approach:  it looks like you're using base + bonus to get to your $84k take-home?  I would just use base salary when making a budget like this.  That way you don't overextend in anticipation of a bonus that may or may not materialize.  Also there is the simple cash flow challenge that expenses are paid monthly, while bonuses are typically paid annually."
ThisTimeLessCrying,"I'd go with the ARM - it will save you \~$250/month.  Ten years is a long time from now - you'll be able to refinance if you need to, or more likely you'll move.  Also, after 10 years you'll have paid down your mortgage by \~$200k, so you'll have less to refinance"
ThisTimeLessCrying,"I switched from TurboTax to a CPA maybe \~7-8 years ago.  An extra $140 seems like a no-brainer, especially given the rental and consulting income.  There are a ton of semi-creative things that can be deducted which will save you a lot of $ (assuming you expect to be above the standard deduction.)"
ThisTimeLessCrying,"One downside of refinancing a 30 year loan into a 10 year is that your monthly payment will be roughly twice as high.  This means if something bad happens (one or both lose your job) you'll now have a 2x the monthly payment to make.

Do you have the option of keeping the 30 year plan, but doubling your monthly payment (with the overpayment going to principle)?  Some loans will let you do that without penalty (but some won't).  

If you can do this then you have best of both worlds -- you can start paying down load faster and therefore pay less interest over the next 10 years, while retaining the optionality of a lower monthly payment in the case of unforeseen circumstances.

Also, I would accelerate repayment in order of interest rate - i.e. pay down the 6.75% loan as fast as you comfortably can, then move on to the 5.125%, etc.

Hope this helps."
ThisTimeLessCrying,"To pick off a few of your questions that others haven't answered yet:

* Turbotax is fine for now since your situation is straightforward
* Be a bit wary of concentrating a lot of your wealth in the shares of one company
* For a financial planner, you may be best off finding someone for a one-off engagement -- he/she can help get you set up, run a few models, and answer all of your questions.  Probably don't need an ongoing person to manage things for you yet.  You can find fiduciaries in your area on the CFP website.

ThisTimeLessCrying,"I'd get the Chase Sapphire Reserve card.  It's a little pricey - $450 per year - but you earn 3x points on any travel or dining spend.  It also gives you $300 credit towards any travel expenses (airfare, hotels, airbnb, etc.) plus a few other little perks:  free rental car insurance (so you can decline all the BS options the rental car company tries to push on you), access to airport lounges.  

The card generates Chase points which can be used across airlines, or converted at reasonable rates to other types of loyalty points (e.g. Marriott, etc.)

The sign up bonus is like 50k points, so you may actually be able to use those points for your upcoming trips."
ThisTimeLessCrying,"Yes, this is better advice.  I'm based in California which does not have the state income tax deduction, so I'm only familiar with the deduction in theory.  I picked Vanguard because of the low fee options, but you're right that it's a Nevada plan.  With any luck Colorado has some decent, low fee options!"
ThisTimeLessCrying,"Credit history is one of the elements that determines your credit score, so it's a good idea that you're opening a credit card.  You already mentioned the most important thing - always pay off the FULL balance every month, and just in general be careful of overextending yourself.  Find a credit card with no annual fee, set up autopay linked to your checking account, and you should be good to go."
ThisTimeLessCrying,"You did the right thing.  CS is a great degree, and you'll get a job that allows you to make the monthly payments. (also, pro tip, focus on what the monthly payment is, not what the outstanding principle is - it will feel much more manageable.)  Most people can't get their s\*\*\* together to pay down their debts, or get a CS degree - you did both.

Nice work!"
ThisTimeLessCrying,"This is correct.

You might invest an hour to get proficient at Excel, and in particular the PMT, PPMT and IPMT functions.  With a bit of practice you'll be able to build a simple spreadsheet that let's you run just about any 'what if' scenario you can imagine."
ThisTimeLessCrying,"Yes, basically you have to believe that the market gains of your 529 account will beat the 18 year inflation of higher education.  Historically higher education has risen 2.5-4% per year.

Doing both is not a bad idea, just a bit more complexity of managing two accounts over the next 18 years (including occasionally rebalancing the 529 allocations.)"
ThisTimeLessCrying,"They key question is when you expect to need the money.  If you need it within the next year, then a savings account is fine (but bear in mind it won't generate much money, but it's better there than just sitting in a checking account.)  If you don't expect to need it for a few years (say for a car or house down payment) then you might consider opening an account with a place like Fidelity and buying index funds.  These should generate better return (though unlike a savings account, they can go down if the economy turns south) and you can get your money out with about a week's notice. "
ThisTimeLessCrying,"Bit of a darkhorse one, but if you're an Amazon Prime member you might check out the Amazon Prime Rewards Visa card:  5% back on all Amazon and Whole Foods purchases, 2% back on gas, restaurants and drug stores, and 1% on everything else.

tectonictigress,"Idk about the long statement - are they referring to a fee from the account you open or is it their own fee they’re applying?

I have no idea what you’re reading - maybe double check the difference between being able to *deduct* vs *contribute* to an IRA - I don’t think there is any rule anywhere that says you cannot *contribute* to an IRA, the limitations only apply to if the contributions can be *deducted* from your AGI "
tectonictigress,"I’d break out the “food and pleasantries” budget more, it’d be better if you could track what your currently spending it on and see if there is anything you can cut back to save or at least see what would change between where you are now versus after you move

Are you contributing to any sort of retirement account through work to get a match? You should track that as well 

Also, as someone who currently lives 5 min from work and thus only fills up three times every two months, I agree that 150/month on gas is quite high"
tectonictigress,"What about groceries and eating out and going out with friends or subscriptions like Netflix or Spotify? 

You’ve accounted for the absolute things you pay each month like rent and utilities, but that’s only a portion of where your money is actually going"
tectonictigress,"Have you checked with KBB and other sites to see what is a reasonable value for your car based on age and miles?

I was worried about this too when mine was recently totaled but I didn’t really think I could do anything about it, but I was pleasantly surprised when they sent me the marker valuation for it, they looked at similar cars for sale within a 50 mile radius of where I live with same make model year and miles and compared that to the condition of my car (age of tires, any other surface dents, etc) that would inc or dec the value of my car 

I’d wait to see what they come back with before panicking about it :)"
tectonictigress,"You can edit your post and add this there so that others can see it, but you really need to break that down further

How much of your spending is rent, food, utilities, insurance, etc - itemize each one to make a budget - including that other 600 that you say goes to car maintenance and Dr appts, are those occurring monthly as well? You have to track where every dollar is going each month to figure out what you can cut or save or do differently

The 30k also needs to be broken down between car and “other bills”- are they in collections? Medical debt? Credit card debt? - and you need to know the interest rates for each one"
tectonictigress,"I'll admit I'm not 100% sure if this is correct but I took a stab at it and this is what it came out as:

Assuming no change in your salary of 130k, 12% (6% from you and 6% from employer) of that is 1300/month of deposits over let's say 10 years with a 4% interest rate (which might be low balling it) and all into a pre-tax 401k

When you leave after 10 years at age 45, it'll have grown to 192k (and earned interest of \~32k)

If you're not withdrawing until age 60, then in that 15 year gap it will have grown to 345k

So with you just putting in 78k over 10 years, you earn 267k

Though I have no clue what ""automatic 1%"" means nor how the pension plan fits in, maybe someone else more familiar with that can help

ETA: As the other user pointed out, I'm assuming you're contributing the minimum, you'd get an even greater return if you max it out at 19k which it sounds like you can afford?"
tectonictigress,"Your rent is on the high side for your income, can you find a roommate or move somewhere cheaper to lower that?

tectonictigress,"No expenses at all? 

If you want to earn more money but your field doesn't have room for growth, then learn a different field or supplement your income with side jobs - you're young, you have time

Does your employer offer a 401k? Health insurance?

First thing is to build up an emergency savings"
tectonictigress,"The Prime directive in the sidebar can address all of your questions

Keep 3-6 months of expenses in an HYSA like Ally - contribute more to account for expected costs associated with the move to CA

Max out your IRA, then max out the 401k - anything outside of that can go into the brokerage

What other options do you have for your 401k investments - VHGEX has a somewhat high expense ratio of 0.48 - check the ER for the other fund you're investing in and see if there is something lower (see the 401k fund selection guide in the wiki for more info)"
tectonictigress,"If you make 2000 and only have 450 in expenses then yes, that is 1550 in money you can set aside in savings

But you need to actually make a budget that lists out how much you spend on food and other items because you clearly are going to have more than 450 in expenses in each month if you’re not accounting for food and rent and other necessities in that"
tectonictigress,"To the IRA or to the fund? 

Put everything you put in the IRA into the fund - you can re-allocate later if you want once you've learned more about investing - but overall time in the market is the biggest benefit you have at the moment with your age

The max you can contribute to the IRA is 6000 for the year - contribute however much you want to the IRA but you have to invest it otherwise it'll be earning something like a whopping 0.5% interest which is pointless for the IRA

Do you already have an e fund set up? Are you planning on buying a car or house in the next 3-5 years that you need to save up for? - those types of questions would alter how much you actually put in to the IRA"
tectonictigress,"Build up an emergency fund and keep it in an HYSA (high yield savings account like Ally, Discover, or Goldman Sachs)

Then open a Roth IRA at a broker like Fidelity, Vanguard, or Schwab 

The prime directive in the sidebar is a good place to start - you can skip over the parts with debts and 401k but everything else should give you a good idea of what to think about - plus the 401k steps are things to keep in mind for when you start full time after grad school "
tectonictigress,"Based on your response, it doesn't sound like you have a budget put together

The best way to start paying back your debt and not incur more is to track where every dollar is going with a budget - you'll likely be surprised by how much you're spending on food - switch to groceries and cooking more at home/meal prep and you can easily save up more

You can download your statements for the past few months from your bank account (are you using a debit card now?) and categorize every line item to figure out where it's all going

With your income and only obligated expenses around 700, that's 3700 leftover that you have to split between paying debt, saving, and other variable expenses

Is the 3% in the 401k matched by your employer at all? 

As for the debts, you mention Credit Karma, but have you checked your actual credit report with the three bureaus? You can check it annually for free (see the Wiki for more info) - that will give you a better idea of what's owed where so that you can take steps to remedy it 

Btw, what are you going to school for?"
tectonictigress,"Don’t withdraw from your 401k - most if not all would agree “personal and social lives” are not worth it - especially since your 401k *is* your future personal and social life - you’d probably only have to cut back temporarily now to get things paid off 

Post a budget breakdown with your income and expenses and list out your debts and their interest rates - you’ll get specific advice on where to cut and how to pay it back"
mcadamsandwich,"&gt; Is it as easy as just a refinance in their name alone?

Yep. Assuming they can qualify on their own.

&gt; Does this take me off the title?

Yep. You may have to pay for a new title if it's not included in the refinance.

&gt; If so, how long should I wait until I attempt a purchase of a ""new"" car?

Your credit may change a bit, but I would get a car ASAP if you need one."
mcadamsandwich,"I would find something reliable and pay cash for it. You can't guarantee you'll be able to make payments towards the financed or leased car, especially as you're just going into college. Don't forget to factor in the costs for insurance, tax/title/tags, gas, and upkeep."
mcadamsandwich,"&gt; if worst case scenario one of my roommates moves out in a year.

No, the worst case scenario is when both of your friends move out and leave you with all of the bills. Can you comfortably afford the house and all of the utility and maintenance bills? If so, sure, it *might* make sense to purchase and rent out the rooms but only if you plan on living there long enough to offset fees, down payments, etc. and potentially riding out a dip/recession. If you have a stable job, like the area, and can afford it all on your own.... I'd vote yes.

If no, then I would highly suggest renting until you can."
mcadamsandwich,"&gt; It shows your company is paying below-market rates for your work, and they need to make your salary competitive.

Sure, but unfortunately that's not how it plays out in the real world. I'm underpaid based on my position, experience, education, and time in service. When I was offered a job at a competitor at ~2x my salary, I brought the written offer to my boss and they essentially handed me a box and helped me to the door. 

You may be ""worth"" market rate, but employers don't have to pay that."
mcadamsandwich,"&gt; I can guarantee one of my friends would not move out.

You can't guarantee that unless you get that from them in writing, nor can you guarantee that they won't die. Shit happens.

&gt; I also don't see myself staying in this home past 3-5 year mark. So is it a good idea if, like you said, I have to ride out a dip.

Rent. "
mcadamsandwich,"*Possibly*. 

If you had a written job offer AND you were comfortable leaving if it came down to it, I'd certainly use that to show your market value. In reality, an interview isn't a job offer so it's not really indicative of your worth to an employer. "
mcadamsandwich,Take Job A and work on your realtor business on the side until it surpasses the income from Job A (this is what YouTubers and Twitch streamers do). You have a 5-10 year headstart and $80/hr is a ridiculously great salary to start. 
mcadamsandwich,"Assuming you've done your research on what you think you should be paid and have valid examples of work you've done to support that... send your boss an email asking to chat about your annual performance review. 

Since you're relatively new and just received a performance bonus in December, chances are you won't get a raise this year. "
mcadamsandwich,"&gt; How do I counter their offer? I'd like 22% but would settle for 15%, to put me where I want. But I'm assuming they'll do like 5%.

Do you have regional, local, or work examples to show *why* you're worth an extra 22%? Odds are that's not calculated into the budget, so you'll get the standard new salary."
mcadamsandwich,"Yeah, probably.

This is where having a Real Estate agent or friend comes through huge. An agent could reach out to them and explain that they have a client who's looking for a building in that area. If they're interested in selling, the agent would take a cut of that sale. "
mcadamsandwich,"&gt; I feel that even being considered by a recruiter is some sort of validation

Remember: recruiters get paid to find people that fill a need. You might be the perfect fit, but you might have been one of a dozen potential hires. "
mcadamsandwich,"&gt; Is it possible to trade in a vehicle im still paying on? How does that work?

Yes. 

If you owe *less* than what the vehicle is worth, you'll have positive equity, or a surplus, that will be applied to the new vehicle's price. If you owe *more* than what the vehicle is worth, you *could* roll that negative equity into a new loan, but most people strongly advise against that. "
ithankgod1,"I don't know if single payer goes too far on one direction. Of course, if all the vested interests don't want reform, the single payer system may be the only solution. Right now, my main focus is stop the abusive billing system. 
Thank you. I will reach out to them to learn more."
ithankgod1,"Negative consequence by applying hospital's financial assistance? Is there any negative consequence filing an application for hospital financial assistance? Can the provider stop service? Will it ding my credit score? Is it confidential?

Background:

Almost all the medical bills I got have some errors. I spent countless hours talking to insurance and the provider's billing department. Some of the issues got resolved. Some not. And I just got a new bill today. No surprise. Another error. This time a bill from a doctor my wife and I didn't remember seeing. And we checked his picture on the provider's website and can't recognize him. And we didn't visit that facility on the service date. The rep insisted the bill is valid but suggested that we should apply financial assistance. It makes sense to me. If 60% of the charge can be written off, then I shouldn't spend all the time arguing with them over the phone. But what about negative consequences I don't know about?

Any advice is highly appreciated!"
ithankgod1,Thank you for the link. I see he paid a full premium in 2016. I tried to make my income stays below the threshold but it is difficult to do. And the subsidy only reduces the premium. The deductible is also very high. I am paying almost $10K premium with a $13K deductible annually.
ithankgod1,"Thank you very much. I really don't know it. I am in Ohio. I probably can get my wife to quit her job to get this benefit. But I need to check deeper to see if it has other restraints such as work requirements, etc."
ithankgod1,"Update on OhioHealth balance billing I posted here an in network provider balance billed me a couple of days ago. And I received a lot of feedback and advices. Thank you. Here is the update:

I made about 15 calls to both the insurance and provider in the last 3 days. The response from insurance was ""the balance on your EOB is your responsibility, don't pay anything beyond that"". The response from provider is ""we billed you since your insurance didn't pay the full amount."" The provider denied that it used the wrong diagnosis code and claimed insurance confirmed the procedure is not covered when it called insurance. However, I checked with my insurance before the procedure. And I retained the email from my insurance which says the procedure is covered.

Finally, I got lucky. An experienced insurance rep agreed to call the provider. The provider used the wrong diagnosis code and agreed to resubmit the claim. It will take about 30 days to reprocess. I pray this issue is resolved.

Recap:

My wife had Amniocentesis at an in network provider. The provider submitted doctor's charge, ultrasound and facility charge separately. Insurance processed doctor's charge and ultrasound charge. But it applied a full ""insurance discount"" to the facility charge. My EOB shows my responsibility is $36. The provider billed me $1286 wanting me to pay ""insurance discount"" of $1,250.

Before my wife got pregnant, I never used my healthcare much and was satisfied with it. Now I realized the healthcare billing system is so abusive. Almost every bill I got contains some errors. It is really stressful and frustrating. And some of the billing errors are simple mistakes. For instance, the provider submit an OB bill to the insurance using Husband's name as patient multiple times. I want to know if there is any nonprofit organization in central Ohio fighting this outrageous billing practice. I want to volunteer for such organizations. If there is none, should we get together to create one?"
ithankgod1,"How early retirees get medical insurance? PBS and others are reporting that Pete Adeney, also known as Mr. Money Mustache, practices an extreme frugality that allowed him to retire at age 30. I am wondering where they get their medical insurance. Obamacare is very expensive with high deductibles. I think the insurance plus deductibles can easily consume their annual budget of $25K.

Thanks."
ithankgod1,"What to do when Hospital ordered two identical tests I am battling with balance billing from an in-network provider.  

And I just discovered another issue. In November 2018, my wife found she was pregnant and we went to her OB. OB ordered more than 15 different tests from the hospital's lab totaling more than $3500. One of those is carrier screen costing us $540. On January 4 2019, we went to the Maternal Fetal Medicine in the same hospital system. We only wanted to do a Amniocentesis. But we had to see a genetic counselor first. (They wouldn't see us when we tried only book for the Amnio). She recommended several blood tests. And we just want to get through her quickly to do the Amnio. We chose the cheapest one. Guess what? She sold us another carrier screen test. Fortunately, this is from an out of system vendor only costing $199 per person. $340 cheaper than the one done in the hospital system. However, we don't need another test when the first one is negative.

I admit I should had examined the test more carefully. But the hospital never sent us the itemized bill. I will never discovered it if I had not been fighting them for balance billing. And the counselor is supposed to go through my wife's pregnancy history before recommending the test to us.

Any advice is highly appreciated!"
ithankgod1,"Update: I checked with my insurance today. They reprocessed the claim after OhioHealth submitted the corrected code. Now the corrected EOB says ""Hospital Outpatient"" not ""Nursing home"". That's after 17 phone calls and messages. 5 hours spent. And the hospital billing side has not corrected its bill yet. I think I should send the hospital a bill reflecting my hours spent. One more thing, the hospital submitted total charges of $1601. Only $173.13 are allowed. Their bills are inflated to a fraudulent level.

I am still waiting for the provider changing its bills. "
Werewolfdad,"&gt;If I add more to Roth IRA this week for 2018 year, can that help my tax return of this season?

No.  Roth IRAs are funded by post-tax dollars.  And its a refund.  Tax returns are the documents you file.

&gt;How come when I added in my work expenses (laptop, work clothes, education) my tax return doesn’t go up?

Are you an employee?  I am so since you included W2 in your title.  If so, these are nondeductible.  


"
Werewolfdad,"1.	  Spending on it and paying it off is good.   Maxing it out is bad for that statement cycle for credit score purposes. 
2.	good job
3.	little of column a, little of column b
4.	it doesn’t matter in the long run.  You can always ask for a credit limit increase or get a second card or make an interim payment to keep utilization down. 
5.	good job 
6.	yes, but only for the statement cycle.  Utilization has no memory so if you’re paying it off in full it won’t matter 
7.	id probably make two or 3 payments per month to keep the statement balance lower.  "
Werewolfdad,"1.	 ~~Yes, unless you’re self employed.~~  I misread that, no your employer doesn't have to have a 401k.  A 401k must be offered through an employer (or self employment)
2.	  The amount your employer puts in on top of your contributions.  
3.	  Yes.  That is normally how it’s done
4.	  You can’t.   (Unless self employed)
5.	  No
6.	  traditional 401ks are taxed when withdrawn.  Roth IRAs don’t Provide a tax break but aren’t taxed when withdrawn. 
7.	if you’re self employed, you’d likely just owe penalties unless you did some serious fraud. "
Jobsunknown,"If/when you decide to buy a house, YOU buy the house. Not you and your girlfriend. If you think y'all will be getting married soon then wait until then. Splitting rent is one thing, splitting a $100k+ asset is another."
Jobsunknown,"Trying using cash. Have a balance book where you write down every time you and your wife spend money (how much and on what). There are plenty of apps you can try like YNAB, mint, every dollar, spendee, etc.. Have a monthly, biweekly, or even weekly budget meeting with your wife."
Jobsunknown,"1st: calm down.

2nd: DO NOT withdraw from your 401k, this is not a personal savings account (that's why there are penalties when withdrawing early)

3rd: maybe consider getting on a budget and work on paying off this debt so when the next kids comes you aren't panicking.

4th: kids are only as expensive as you make them. Yes little Jimmy needs a bed. No little Jimmy does not need the sleep/rocker 2000 that's worth a couple grand.

5th: as far as doctors bills go, this comes down to your insurance so plan to meet your max out of pocket before you get the bill."
Jobsunknown,I would say write a check to pay off 15k so that you still have a savings. Then start budgeting to pay more on your loans. Not sure what your income is but with an average income you could pay the rest off in a couple of years. Playing games with this much debt could be dangerous. You don't want to be looking up 20 years from now wondering why you haven't been able to pay it off making minimum payments and transferring it over to other creditors.
Jobsunknown,"No, nope, again no, 1000X no. Unless you are about to be homeless because of this debt do not pull out from your 401K. A better idea might be to stop putting into your retirement (temporarily), get on a budget, sell unnecessary items around the house, and start paying off the debt."
Jobsunknown,"If you have a reasonable savings, no debt, and live within your means i don't think you should ever need to consider using your 401k prior to retirement. I would stop trying to math it so much. Pay off the loan in the next year and then max out your retirement funds."
RIFIRE,"At the current rates it's about $1.85 per $1000.

It's not really worth the effort if you're just doing $100 here and there, just keep that in a high yield savings account.   If you're talking about $15000 it's more worth the effort because they do pay a little better than most HYSAs."
RIFIRE,"The most important factor is how liquid you need it to be.  

If you might need it in the next couple of months, go with an online bank making 2%+.  Keep it simple.

If you won't need it for a longer period of time you can start looking at options that lock the money up for some time for a little extra return.  I happen to like I Bonds for money I 100% won't need for a year and likely won't need to touch for 5 years (so basically my emergency fund) but there are also lots of good CD options out there.  

It would take a lot of effort to truly optimize and always get the best returns.  I'm not interested in moving all of my money every time a new bank offers .1% more than the competition so I just stick to one ""good enough"" savings account for quickly accessible savings and I Bonds for the rest. "
RIFIRE,"You can withdraw the backdoor conversion without tax or penalty because it's not a taxable conversion.  If there is a gain and/or also taxable conversions it gets a little more complicated but here's a great thread from the Bogleheads forum.

https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=156092

Specifically, from kaneohe's post:

**Conversions: Tax-No ;Penalty-No (Nontaxable Portion)**

"
RIFIRE,"I'd close it if they won't convert it to something free.  

I have a 15 year old card from capital one that I'm thinking of closing.  No annual fee but they won't increase my limit (it's basically my lowest limit card) and reject me when I apply for other cards.  I don't think any company other than capital one has rejected me for a credit card in the past 5 years.  The rewards aren't anything special (quicksilver, 1.5%) so I'm about to be done with them completely."
RIFIRE,"If you're going down the crypto route for this, there are a few other ""stablecoins"" with similar concepts.  Gemini is another exchange that has their own, Tether I think is still the biggest one, Dai is one that doesn't rely on a single company guaranteeing the dollars are really there backing things.  Consider the pros/cons of each and maybe consider spreading things out a bit."
RIFIRE,"Yeah, if there was a 2.4%/4 week investment I'd put everything I had into it :) But keep in mind the interest is paid by our tax dollars.

It's just a rate that's a little higher than most savings accounts, nothing magical.  If you're getting less than 2% now, it probably makes sense to just pick an online bank that pays over 2% and call it a day."
RIFIRE,"Capital One 360 has a savings account with no minimum that pays 1% and a money market account that pays 2% if your balance is over $10,000.

Ally has an account that pays 2.2% with no minimum balance. 

4 week T Bills are paying about 2.4%. 

(all of the rates I'm quoting are annual)"
RIFIRE,"&gt; T bills? Really? Why not buy bonds? Why not get a CD from your bank? Seriously, t bills? Jesus.

Most CDs under 1 year pay less than savings account, T Bills are nice if you want a little better than savings account interest without locking up your money for a year (plus no state income tax).  
"
RIFIRE,"""Budget"" is really the wrong word for what I do because I really just track and never have set $ amounts available for certain categories.

Car expenses in general all seem like a similar level of ""need.""  Gas just increased because my commute just increased, but that's not going to mean I take fewer other trips generally.  

I don't really do any specific saving for maintenance and just use my cash reserve for that kind of stuff.  I keep my cash reserve a bit larger than what I would need for an ""emergency fund."""
RIFIRE,"I'm not saying you do, I'm just saying that whatever OP does and knowing how to deal with tax withholding are likely two completely unrelated skills.  Being good enough at something to earn a high income doesn't mean you're going to know a lot about everything."
RIFIRE,"You could consider putting it directly in 26 or 52 week T-Bills.  Might be a bit less than certain CDs but they are state tax exempt so that might make up for it depending on your state.  

Capital One isn't likely to match banks like Ally, they've been a bit lower for as long as Ally has been Ally.  "
RIFIRE,"In retirement accounts, I just reinvest.

In taxable, I have them go to my checking account.  When I have $1k extra built up in checking, I invest it.  I don't want to have a lot of smaller tax lots to deal with.  "
RIFIRE,"Series I Savings Bonds can't be touched during the first year you own them.  You can buy $10k worth per year (and you can use your tax refund to buy more).  

There is also a penalty if you cash them in within 5 years if you think that might be an additional motivator.

Mrpa-cman,"Talk to your insurance about this but
Facility: charge for using the OR room.
Doctor fee: doctor wants to be paid.
First assist: probably a PA to help the doctor in the surgery.
Anesthesia: to put you asleep.
Polar cold care machine: most likely for you to have after surgery. It is a cooler that circulates ice water over your surgery location. I had one for my acl repair and it was great. Kept swelling and pain down. Easily worth the $250 if you have it. Might be able to get your own to keep as they often require them to be returned and cost is about the same. Just make sure you get the right cooling pad as they have them for different surgical locations."
Mrpa-cman,Just a word of advice. I had a cbr 600 for a while and then got on my buddies 1200cc Harley. I expected it to be pretty quick....it was not. My cbr 600 would blow it out of the water any day. So if you are going from a smaller displacement cruiser to a street bike just be aware and you'll do just fine.
Mrpa-cman,"You need to file a police report. Dispute the charges and have it removed. You will not be required to accept this debt, or the damage to your credit. Your father will probably be found guilty and face punishment, but that is his fault. "
Mrpa-cman,"People are telling you to keep them so your credit score doesn't drop. This is good advice for people who can control their spending, but it sounds like there is a possibility that isn't you. Just be honest with yourself. Do you have a problem spending with a card and not paying it off? Are you at risk of spending $1,000 on a shopping spree in a month? 

If you think you might run a lot of debt up then close them. If you are unsure if you can control your finances close all but one and do your best to watch your spending and to ALWAYS pay off the FULL balance every month when the bill comes. Don't fall into the trap of only paying the minimum. "
Mrpa-cman,"You need to ask for an itemized bill for the expenses they supposed had cleaning your apartment. Assuming you cleaned and left the apartment in good condition and documented this with pictures or videos you can take it to the court. I doubt you need a lawyer, you can file in small claims court and submit your evidence yourself. I would suggest telling your previous land lord you plan to take them to court if they don't return your full deposit."
Mrpa-cman,"I opened a Roth IRA via MFS in 2014-15, I put in $550 and added about $400 throughout the year. I spent maybe an hour with the advisor. I don't think it had an effect on my starting date. So now spill the beans on what you know. "
Mrpa-cman,"The wiki on this subject is really good. It has steps on how to budget and set things up. I suggest first you put 3-4 months emergency fund in a savings account. After that depending on your priorities you can save for a car or invest. If your company offers a 401k that will be your best bet. Look into what options your company offers and decide how much risk you want. A 401k, Roth IRA are like boxes for your investments, you pick the investments in the 401k. "
Mrpa-cman,"Your mother is a narcissist from the sound of it. Banking may seem intimidating because of the things she says and does, it really is not. All you need to do is walking into a local banking branch, preferably one your mom isn't associated with, and ask to open an account. Once you do that I suggest going to your bank with a shared account, withdrawing all your money and depositing it in the account that is solely yours. After that remove your name from all shared accounts. If she hard credit cards with your name on them cancel them all. Do not let her try to force you Into keeping them or making you feel guilty. You need to 100% delete her from your financial life. Just call the creditors, explain the situation and close the cards. If she refused to give you enough information to even close the account tell her you are going to open a fraud case and have them closed fraudulent accounts and she can deal with the police. "
Mrpa-cman,I have always found it to be cheaper over the long run to buy my phone outright and then do a non contract service. I've had 2 phones over the last 5 years and I'm happy with it. IDK how much of a power user you are but my first phone was a $550 flag ship. My current phone is a middle ground $250 phone and works well for what I do. I'm in a plan with 3 other people and I pay $30 a month for unlimited text and calls and 3 gigs of data. 
Mrpa-cman,I know this is a generic statement but you should read the sidebar for this sub on your PC. There is a really nice flow chart to help you decide the order of things you should so. There are also severl books suggested that will be helpful. A IRA would be nice but if your employer offers a 401k that would be better. Reason being you can invest more per year. Both ira and 401ks are not investments themselves. Rather think of them as special tax boxes you put your investments in that the government taxes in a way that helps you more than regular investments. Congratulations on your new job!
Mrpa-cman,"Take a detailed video of every room, floor walls and ceiling. Include the fridge, and any and all appliances. If a shelf is missing, light cover, anything say so in your recording. More detail is better. When you move out do the same thing. Make sure the house is clean, fridge and stove included. 

I'd they try to keep it ask for a itemised expense form, this is required in most states. If there are things you don't agree with go to small claims court. It's like $20 to file for it and you can do it with out a lawyer. Just submit the video of the apt when you moved in and when you moved out as evidence. "
Mrpa-cman,For starters I would let your dad know that if he does this again he will hear from the police for committing identity theft. If you want him to be prosecuted file a police report. If you do t was t your father to get in trouble just file a dispute and explain you were 11 at the time. You should also get a full credit report and dispute everything. 
exoticworldtraveler,You are working way to hard at this. You need to slow down and learn some basics. Your post points out that you are interested in a savings account but you down even know how often the interest is credited. 
exoticworldtraveler,"If you have no other debt, 7-8k should be the top of what you finance and then only finance it for 36 or 48 months. Try to come up with a 20% down payment, no less than 10%. Your future self will thank you."
exoticworldtraveler,"You are correct that Starting Bal + credits(as they occur) - debits (as they occur) = current balance.

Assuming your deposits are corrext , your spending total cannot be correct if the statement balance is correct.

There is something in the numbers you are using that does not match the numbers that the bank has. You will need to go day by day, line item by line item, to find what is different."
exoticworldtraveler,"Just take the 4400 and buy another old car. 2nd option is use the 4400 as a down payment and take out a small car loan and pay it back over 2 years. Just my opinion but a $8800 car is normally alot better than $4400 car
"
exoticworldtraveler,Put them both up for sale and get rid of the 1st one thats sells. If you dont get enough to fully pay off the loan get a personal loan to cover the difference. Your best bet would be to sell both cars and get a beater for a year or 2.
exoticworldtraveler,"No way I would even consider doing this.
You are 3000 miles away and putting a lot of trust in the management company.

Just a few of many questions for you to consider.

1.Have you properly vetted the management company. Do they have a track record of providing the services you will need them to perform.

2.Have you properly researched the market in WV and western MD. $50k is dirt cheap when compared to the California market but it is that price for a reason.

3. Are there better real estate investment choices available to me either in this area or somewhere else. IMO the answer to this is almost certainly yes but I am not you."
exoticworldtraveler,"No 401k loan, you are not broke and on the verge of being homeless. What you need is a real budget. You have 1000+/- every month not allocated based on the numbers you posted. 

You also dont need a new and cannot afford a new car, your current car has only 140k miles."
exoticworldtraveler,"You are enabling her by paying a higher percentage of expences. If she will not cut back on spending and look for a job, set a deadline (maybe 1 month) for her to get another job or you move out."
exoticworldtraveler,"Could you afford it maybe. Should you buy it, no. For 2 reasons.

Payment +maint fee puts you at $1500 a month and that is without taxes and imsurance.

Also, Its usually never a smart idea to buy a place if you are not committed to staying a minimum of 5 years. "
exoticworldtraveler,"You need to double check with HR about that, most companies want you to select a percentage not a specific dollar. In fact many companies will not accept a specific $ amount because if it mess to calculate the match correctly.

The matching is based on precentage contributed not a dollar figure.

But here is the formula if you insist on doing it.  take yearly base pay ,divide by 52= weekly gross pay. WGP x .05 = specific $ amount."
exoticworldtraveler,I dont know Ohio law but many states have what is called a 3 day cooling period where you can cancel a car purchase. It was put in place to prevent high pressure sales people taking advantage of a situation.
exoticworldtraveler,"Definately switch, you will be glad you did. Most if not all of the junk fees you are use to paying will disappear. I do virtually all my banking online but when I have needed to talk to someone the customer service is way better.

Regarding what to look for , that really depends on how you bank.
Online services and app, ATM locations, branch locations , APY on deposits... 

"
exoticworldtraveler,"When comparing refund amounts, state and federal have nothing to do with each other. 

Since you triple checked your federal return I would assume that is correct. Unless you know of a specific error that you made.

 Double or triple check your state return before filing and if everything is correct press the send button.

"
jacod_b,"6 months of expenses is still around $5,000 so I would have that in a high yield savings. It’s super easy to open an account with an online bank like Ally, Alliant, Discover, Capital One, etc. I’d check their sign up bonuses too. I know some offer tiered bonuses depending how much you deposit. 

To your second point, CDs will lock your money up and get you maybe a percentage point more than a high yield or money market account. With a house purchase in the undetermined future for me, I personally value the liquidity over the extra couple hundred bucks a year. With anything involving investments, the higher the return, the higher your risk. You could invest in the stock market but do you accept the risk that in 5 years you may have lost half of your money for a down payment so now you have to keep renting? It’s important to consider risk and reward when making these decisions"
jacod_b,Policy genius is a decent and easy to use term insurance comparison site. They also have some useful information. I would recommend using fake but close information and create and an email to get an idea of what prices you might expect to pay without getting inundated by offers
jacod_b,"I think betterment would be better for you in terms of presenting options to you and the resources they have plus they’ll take care of everything for you (for a fee). You can start a Roth IRA with them but just know on top of fees for the funds they charge like .3% or something. I tried acorns for a bit but it wasn’t good for me and I didn’t like their pricing structure at the time, idk if they changed it. They charged $1 a month at the time. Let’s say I have $600 in the account, that $12 is equal to 2% fee!! Just make sure whatever you choose to do, understand the tax implications and limitations on accessing the funds. For a vast majority of people, the best way to grow wealth is consistently invest into well diversified funds over the long term and compound interest will work it’s magic for you"
jacod_b,"Hopefully the income from the part time job is greater than your contribution. I’m not 100% sure but if the reimbursement isn’t considered taxable income then it doesn’t count for contributions. If your gross income was less than $12,000 then you don’t need to file taxes"
jacod_b,"Yes, it is risky to invest a loan. Anything that will get you returns greater than what a loan will give you will be a fairly risky endeavor. Also, you have to be careful with the language in the loan as it’s possible it may only be allowed to be used for a specific purpose, such as schooling."
jacod_b,"I could be wrong but I’m pretty sure money market accounts are just a marketing term for high yield savings. And yea if those CDs work for you, I’d consider them. Maybe hit all the requirements for a sign up bonus (read the fine print, they may require you to keep the money in your account for a set amount of time) then purchase some CDs for the extra interest to really maximize your returns"
jacod_b,"Definitely better services. From what I’ve seen most banks just offer small fixed percentages. Because you’re looking at a long time horizon, that doesn’t really make sense. Brokers like vanguard and fidelity offer low cost funds to invest in. For simplicity, you can just dump it all into a target date fund that should have pretty low expense ratios. That will diversify your portfolio to generally appropriate allocation of stocks, bonds, etc and automatically rebalances and changes those allocations as you get closer to the “target date” ie when you plan on retiring"
jacod_b,2 grand is kinda low for an emergency fund unless you’re not paying rent right now? You should have at least 6 months of expenses in an emergency fund. It also doesn’t need to be in a safe. Put it in a high yield savings account along with this additional money. Most of those are earning &gt;2% now and they’re FDIC insured. 2 to 5 years would definitely be too close to invest it in the market especially if it’s for a house
jacod_b,"Studies show time and again actively managed funds rarely beat index funds, even during times of volatility when they’re supposed to perform best (look at 4Q18). I think because you have such a long time horizon with the Roth and there’s nothing too intricate going on then meeting with your fee free advisor would be enough (read the fine print just to be sure). I would probably recommend just putting it all into a low cost target date. Truly set and forget. It automatically rebalances and reallocates funds as needed"
jacod_b,I’ll echo everyone else that said to open a new account but I want to add you should freeze your credit as an extra safety measure. Since she’s your mom she probably knows your social security information. Not saying she would take out any lines of credit in your name but better safe than sorry. Also a good thing to do regardless of your situation
jacod_b,"u/cheekyuser offered some good advice so I want to focus on another point. $6,000 is the max you can put into an IRA- traditional, Roth, or a combination. If applicable, she can consider maxing out an HSA. If you still want to contribute to retirement it’s probably the 401(k) is the best bet"
jacod_b,"Yes, there is a way it is not as bad as it looks. Perhaps you can ask your dad about the specifics of his plan as many whole life insurance policies vary wildly. Long story short, I’m guessing the note saying it CAN terminate the policy has a caveat saying if the loan grows larger than the cash value of his policy. It’s also possible the policy pays out dividends. Those dividends can be used to pay the interest. Furthermore, many people use whole life insurance policies to get retirement income. They take out loans and just never pay them back. As long as the Loan and interest doesn’t accrue greater than the cash value, when the insured dies then the outstanding loan and interest is deducted from the death benefit. 

Edit: I’ll also note that policy loans have no impact to your credit, whether you pay it back or not

Edit 2: here’s some more useful info from investopedia to help calm your nerves a bit. Still worth talking to your parents, could be an interesting learning experience! https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/111314/how-can-i-borrow-money-my-life-insurance-policy.asp"
jacod_b,"Yea I can definitely see how that can be alarming. Did they do something recently that could use a loan that big? Well I can’t let you off the hook that easy, so on the stress-inducing side of things, basing off of the little info I got It doesn’t seem sustainable if he plans on taking out 90k every year. A $1M policy sold originally when he was 45 and healthy, the premiums could be around $20k a year. If he got it when he was older it would cost more. So I doubt he has a policy that large if he only has 85k in premium and even if he did, 90k per year may still not be sustainable. Perhaps ask to see some of the projections the advisor gave him. 

Edit: I should also point out that I’m like 95% sure if it does lapse he’d only have to pay taxes on the amount over the premium put into the policy - in this case $5,000. "
jacod_b,"You’re right in thinking that because your credit limit is typically whatever deposit you put in. So you’d drain your bank account and then owe interest. Not a great plan. I personally don’t like to use my credit card as debt. I pay it off in full at least every month. I understand extenuating circumstances can happen I personally don’t think I should spend more than I can afford. Since you said you can afford it, I think you should buy it outright. If that doesn’t feel comfortable then maybe you should look at a cheaper laptop or wait a bit if possible. Another alternative could be getting financing through the store possibly. Might be a chance the interest is less than a credit card. Lastly, I think you should get a credit card regardless but use it for every day purchases and pay it off every month. Don’t start the debt cycle now"
jacod_b,"Glad I could help, I’m glad to see you’re getting a head start! You’ll be thanking yourself as long as you stay responsible. I would recommend the capital one just because if you end up traveling abroad, visa and MasterCard are typically more widely accept than discover/diners club"
jacod_b,Yes you will be taxed on the gains. Anything in there that’s less than a year old will be taxed in your highest income bracket. If it’s been there for more than a year then it will get the capital gains tax rate
jacod_b,Yea it’s honestly probably not worth the hassle of transferring the 401(k) over. Start putting money into a Roth so you can make it a “habit” and you’ll be used to it. Also I truly wish you the best of luck not changing your lifestyle. Lifestyle creep is a veryyy real thing and I’ll be damned if it hasn’t snuck up on me a couple times. Those happy hours and lunches out with the coworkers add up quickly
jacod_b,"Technically yes, but you should be using whatever money you’d be putting into the stocks and pay off those bills instead. I’d also consider doing a lot more research and getting an understanding of things before investing anything else other than index/target date funds in your 401k and/or Roth IRA. "
jacod_b,"Okay let’s see if I can answer some of these..
1) APR is the “annual percentage rate”. Let’s say your APR is 25% and credit card bill is $100 and don’t pay it at all, in a year you’ll now owe $125. This interest is extremely high, think how something as risky as the stock market only returns 7% on average. Fairly rarely it will return 25% in a single year. 
For the second part of the question, paying in full each month will over time increase your credit because it shows that your trustworthy and pay your debts on time. I highly recommend the idea that you never spend more than you can afford (ie pay off your credit card bill in full every month, don’t spend more than you can afford!). If you just keep paying the minimum, your score will stay the same but your debt will be growing at that ridiculous rate I mentioned before. PLUS, your minimum will continue to grow, increasing your utilization. 

2) in this specific instance, a lot of dealers don’t allow you to pay more than just a certain amount on a credit card (I think when I bought mine I could only use $1,000). Secondly, spending 5,000 and paying it off that month is no different than spending $50 and paying it off. Another thing to note for large purchases with credit cards, occasionally they’ll charge the 3% fee which would outweigh the percentage back you get in rewards, not worth it. To your questions about utilization, I pay off my credit cards at least once a week through my online banking apps. This is mostly so I see the money actually leaving my bank account as the month progresses and this is a personal preference. There is the benefit that it does decrease my utilization since the balance that hits my monthly statement is say $300 instead of $1,200 for an example. I don’t really care about that because credit utilization doesn’t have a memory on the credit report. 

3) find out your credit score from credit karma, if you have no credit, perhaps consider a secured card or a beginner card. When you get approved, use it for small purchases at first to keep things under control and most importantly, PAY IT IN FULL EVERY MONTH. 

4) just start with one card for right now. When you find out your credit score you can use a source like nerd wallet to filter cards and find what might be the best for you. They have good explanations of the different types of cards. I recommend just one card because at this point you probably won’t get approved for a card that has many good benefits (while I’m thinking about it, avoid any cards with an annual fee for now). I say just one card because average age of credit is a very important category determining your credit score. In a few years maybe you get another card with good benefits in which case you’d have to manage keeping three cards open. If you only open one right now, at that time you’d only have to concern yourself with keeping two cards open. 

Anyways, hope I didn’t get too confusing, let me know if you have any other questions or confusion about whatever I said. "
jacod_b,"Before worrying about investing I would focus on building your safety net. Long term gains of stocks are useless if you need to cash out in a year because your car got rear ended or you lost your job. Investing in taxable accounts should typically be one of the last options after building your emergency fund, paying off debts, and investing in tax advantaged accounts. I recommend looking at the flowchart in this sub’s wiki as a starting point"
jacod_b,Your last line made me laugh. I forgot which podcast it was but they dove into all the “side hustle” sites and vlogs and whatnot and found the only people making money were the people selling their “techniques”. Some lady spent like $20k in seminars and materials and was making next to nothing from her “drop shipping side hustle”
jacod_b,"Definitely don’t put it into one specific thing, especially something that is trendy like crypto or cannabis stocks. Because 20 years is a long time frame you could put it into an index fund like one that tracks the s&amp;p, then when it gets closer to the time the loan is due you can put the money into bonds or a high yield savings. Also, if you want to be safer then just keep it in bonds the whole time and if you want to be even safer just put it into a high yield servings account. If the account earns 2% per year for 20 years you will end up with ~16,000"
esbforever,"Roth 401k and HCE Testing The last several years, my company has failed the ADP/ACP testing, and I have had part of my 401k contributions returned to me mid-year.  This is annoying, because I then owe taxes on this amount.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that Roth 401ks are subject to the same testing - but is it fair to assume that since this money has already been taxed, if it IS returned, it is at least mine free-and-clear?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"
esbforever,"I’m reading quickly but I don’t think there’s a chance in hell that call came from your bank.

Did you give away any security information to whomever you were speaking?

How long ago was this?  I’d suggest freezing your credit, at a minimum.

Never, ever speak to a financial institution when they call you.  Tell them you will call them back, then go to the web and find a verified customer service number.

Stop taking these pictures.  You have invited unwanted attention. "
esbforever,"I don’t know crap about owed taxes, and I can tell you that you’re almost certainly getting screwed with this tax firm.  Absolutely do not take that meeting.  

Speak to the IRS.  You may even get a small amount of leniency for going to them before they come to you.  

Worst case: the IRS plays hardball.  At that point, you can make an informed decision about maybe going to a $7,000 tax firm.  (Good God, I can barely type it.  Thieves.)"
esbforever,"OP, please disregard the advice about a whole life policy.  You have zero need for insurance, and as an investment, your returns will be significantly below the stock market.  

Concentrate on building an emergency fund, and also paying off the car note.  It sounds like you have far too much car for your salary level."
esbforever,"I didn’t get past your first sentence.  The smartest thing you can do RIGHT NOW is move most of that checking balance into a savings account at the same bank.  This is only temporary while you research the best long-term savings option. 

Too many people don’t understand the dangers of keeping money in a checking account.   Anyone with access to a check of yours (doesn’t even have to be blank), or even just your account number, can have a field day siphoning from your account."
esbforever,"Cashier’s check is different.  And by the bank, where you see the withdrawal, sure.  Can’t imagine that’s very common, but sure.

OP mentioned neither of these things, so I inquired.  Kudos to whoever felt the need to downvote though, that’s amazing. "
esbforever,"Thank you.  And I fully agree; I’ve never been on board with the Roth concept at higher salaries, so I appreciate the validation there.

But... given the HCE problems I’ve been having, it seems this will at least solve the annoyance of getting a check and having to keep part of it on the side (to reconcile in April...)."
esbforever,Isn’t there a chance of counterfeits?   I’ve always been so confused how people are ok accepting possibly tens of thousands of dollars from a total stranger - with absolutely zero recourse in case the bills turn out to be fake. 
esbforever,"Apologies if I’m missing where you mentioned these, but a few things are popping out:

- Are you aiming for 110k gross or net?  This is really important, obviously, if most of your money is sitting in traditional 401ks.

- You’re including social security, which by itself might be dicey depending on how young you are now.  But more importantly, you’re saying you’ll start collecting at 70 - most people who are considering FIREing don’t plan to wait that long, so you really can’t include this money in your calcs for possibly many decades.  Won’t you be far below your target income for a long time?

"
esbforever,"Will your husband get regular access to the accounting books of this company?  The real risk here is that they get profitable but hide the profits in a zillion ways he will never know about.  From cash going “missing”, to owners writing off $700 dinners, to... you name it, it’s been done.  

Also, will he “own” this piece of the business, or just share in the profits?  If the former, he may be responsible for losses, named in lawsuits, etc.

Either way, he’d have to have an awful lot of trust in these people."
esbforever,"That is likely a click-bait headline based on a journalist’s poor understanding of a study.  One of the more famous recent ones was how Americans had less than $X in a savings account.  Great - but many, many people don’t have savings accounts.  So were their balances considered as 0 (pull down the average) or null (not counted)?  Also, the concept of your savings being exactly in a savings account is very much in doubt.  

As a people, we are terrible savers and/or struggling, but the idea the average American can’t outlay $150 for an emergency is comical. "
esbforever,"That 5k other mortgage/debt is a giant chunk of your income.  I’m guessing you’re bringing home $15k a month at the very most - which is cut down to 10k after that line item.  

No, you cannot legitimately afford $7-800k of mortgage on $10k a month.  It’s kind of not close, unless you plan to live insanely frugally, and not have kids or a car. 

Two items you haven’t mentioned, but could potentially swing in your favor: 1) how stable are your jobs?  2) how likely are you to continue achieving substantial raises?"
esbforever,"I have never heard of a non-compete at your salary level.  I’ll assume you’re making around 40k?

Basically, your company thinks you’re too valuable to have you compete against them, but no so valuable that they’ll pay you a better-than-marginal salary.

You should be looking for a new job anyway, because your company is not treating you correctly.  And it might be worth having a lawyer check that agreement before you’re sure it really prevents you from doing anything. "
esbforever,"This is a horrendous idea.  What is the exit/liquidation strategy?

You’re much better off going in with some friends, if this is what you want, on some investment real estate.  You may not make any real money, especially compared to the lost opportunity cost of investing in the market, but at least you can all discuss investment goals beforehand.   There are no investment goals when you’re living in your investment. 

"
Sparkle_Snowflake,"Those two years where you won’t be in school will be a great time to work and save some money. Maybe save for a car, save to put money towards your university semesters, or just as an emergency fund. I wouldn’t touch the money for your grandparents until you’re using that to pay for the community college semesters. It’s not worth messing around with to gain a little bit of interest or dividend. 

I’d also suggest using that time when you’re not in school to beef up your resume. Do some volunteer work, take some certification courses that will help you either find a better paying job now or after you graduate college. (I’m thinking like A+, quickbooks, any Microsoft specialist certs) 

Don’t get a credit card, it honestly will only make things harder! Save a lot and use cash. Best of luck! "
Sparkle_Snowflake,That’s a good ratio. You could probably pay it off in a year or two if you live somewhere reasonable and watch your spending. Take the loans and don’t stress! Just finish school and enjoy your career. You’ve earned that!
Sparkle_Snowflake,"Honestly I’d just stick it out at home if possible, save what you’d be spending on rent and then be able to put a down payment on a house of your own when you move somewhere you actually want to live. "
Sparkle_Snowflake,Oh that makes a lot more sense! My cousin lives out there and I know she pays a ridiculous amount for rent! Didn’t want you in for a nasty surprise when it came time to find a place. Best of luck! ❤️
Sparkle_Snowflake,"Pay yourself first! If you don’t have debt, try saving 3 months at least of monthly expenses. With 4 people living in one place you never know when someone may decide to move out or whatever. 

I’d suggest renters insurance. Don’t buy anything but your mattress new. Furniture is so easy to find on Craigslist, yard sales and Facebook marketplace. 

Put aside money for fun! Treat yourself to a movie or a concert every month. Enjoy being young and living the life! "
Sparkle_Snowflake,Would it not be worth it to just wait out another year or two and then use what you would have spent on extra rent to use as a down payment on a home so you can start building equity?
Sparkle_Snowflake,"Definitely. The emergency fund is critical, because if suddenly you need $600 in car repairs down and you have nothing saved, you’ll be back in more debt. Make sure that you always have a fully funded emergency fund. If you take $200 for a new tire, before you pay any extra on your debt, be sure to pay back the EF. "
Sparkle_Snowflake,"I have a Zinus Green Tea mattress that I got on amazon and I think my full size cost me about $150. It’s by far the most comfortable mattress I’ve ever had, and it’ll be perfect until I can upgrade to one of those fancy sleep numbers or something. 

I’d avoid any more debt for now. Make purchases in cash, and start saving for a new car! "
Sparkle_Snowflake,I saw cut and run! Renovations are pricey and even the best laid plans often turn out different. I would hate for you to stay and try and renovate only for it to slowly increase in cost plus you not getting the new job you like. 
Sparkle_Snowflake,"In general your best interest rates are gonna be T credit unions. The one I banked at in college offered like 3% interest or something. 

Be super careful about predatory lenders. I saw a post on here the other day where someone had like 200% interest on one loan. Just read the fine print but try to go with a smaller lender! "
Sparkle_Snowflake,"I know you say you don’t worry about the car payment but as it stands with just your husband making 1200 a month, more than 50% of your income goes to that car. Maybe selling it and using whatever equity you have to buy something cheaper until you get your debt paid off would be something to consider. 

Beyond that, your debt to family should be paid off first. Then I’d just use the good old fashioned snowball method and pay smallest debt to largest debt, after you’ve saved an emergency fund of $750-$1000 based on your combined income. "
Sparkle_Snowflake,Same thing happened to me. The reviews for this place were mostly bad. But I needed to move ASAP and they had an opening. And I’m sure it’s different everywhere. But I’ve never had a single issue. The one time I had to call maintenance was on a holiday weekend so they were slow. I don’t really blame them for that. My suggestion is see if you can talk to someone who lives there now. Someone angry writing a review will most likely exaggerate the issues. Best of luck! 
Sparkle_Snowflake,"Leasing a car is never a good idea, but you seem pretty sold on it. It’s obvious you can afford it, but spending $350 a month and not having any equity in it seems so silly when you could easily purchase a car and really get your moneys worth over the years. "
Sparkle_Snowflake,"It sounds like a great deal, but I would caution you to be pessimistic about people paying on time. Even the best meaning tenants can fall on hard times. If you have no emergency fund, that can get hairy real fast with your income what it is. "
Sparkle_Snowflake,"Absolutely get a gym membership. Look into getting a post office box as well. For $50 or less you have an address you can safely put on job applications. Sometimes they even can make them appear as a street address. 

On the job front, apply for any and everything. McDonald’s, Panera, grocery stores, gas stations. Just get something for now to get you going and then at least you can sustain some semblance of life as you try to put the pieces together. Start looking at Craigslist for day-of Jobs if there really is no where hiring. Lots of people hire movers for one day only. It’s usually in cash and can be great in a pinch. Consider ubereats, doordash, instacart, stuff you can do as you have the time. "
Sparkle_Snowflake,"In that case I would talk to him and see if you paying what you paid at your old place would be okay, in light of the fact that you have x amount of student loans. 

I don’t think he’s trying to take advantage of you, maybe he doesn’t realize your exact financial details. But suggesting he pays 80% while you pay 20% may make him feel taken advantage of. "

LapetusOne,"Tips on getting the best APR for an auto loan? Besides a good FICO score and a 48 month loan, are there any other tricks to getting a good APR?

LapetusOne,"HSA still a good idea even if I spend it all? I'm really on the fence whether to get a HDHP/HSA this year verses a regular LDHP.

My fear is maxing out the HSA family contribution ($7,000) and ending up having to spend it all on medical expenses.

Would this still be cheaper than having a LDHP?

I've used the HDHP vs LDHP comparison tools but they don't take into account how the deductibles are different between those two plans. For example, just about every expense goes towards the deductible in a HDHP. In a LDHP, damn near nothing goes towards your deductible accept being admitted to the hospital or taking ambulance rides.   
Basically, in a LDHP you'll never hit your deductible.   
In a HDHP you might be bled dry with a family of 4 by never hitting your deductible either.

allied1987,When I filled out my taxes on freetaxusa it gave my then options for tax expedition which I was the same fell under too expensive not affordable and took care of it. I think this year the irs is allowing  you to do your own exceptions instead of having to go through jumps and hoops. It worked for me.
allied1987,"All honesty nope, just selected it cause at the time for me personally it was. It accepted it. I filed and got my refund back and kept the the money they were going to take out.  But all honest based of that definition it would of cause my companies insurance is 10% of your gross pay and what I was paying for it at the new job was more then 20% my gross pay.  Being i was filing single  so yep and almost all company insurance would be able to use that exception especially if your filing single and a single home owner."
allied1987,"Totally agree!with checking out the financing aid office at the hospital!! I had no insurance and went in to the er for a stroke and then into the icu. Then had rehab after that. The luckiest thing even the case workers told me I had no insurance and no red tape. So meant I was given my rehab on scholarship and the hospital bills I applied for financial assistance and being I qualified  they forgave the bills and say. Both the er hospital and the icu hospital I was transferred too.  So probably the luckiest I have been in all my life combined they forgave over 100,000+ in medical bills. So differently check out the financial aid office at the hospital of service!"
allied1987,Well least to get raid of the medical part of it see if those hospitals have a financial aid department. Being you have no income they should reduce the price by a lot or just right it off as a one time freebie. 
allied1987,The penalty caps out at 700$ so no matter if you owe more it should not be more then 700$. They also this year let you do your own exceptions so just choose one  of them that fits your situation and file. I used one of he exceptions and did not have a problem filling it for me out paying 455 back. 
allied1987,All honesty can do like I do. I use my debt card for everything. If his bank supports it he can lock his debit card when not in use. I do it every time after a purchase. It’s as easy as a button press if his mobile bank app supports it. Just enable it when you get ready to check out and disable it again when you get done. I do this cause if anyone get my debt card number there chances are very limited time window to pull funds from it. 
allied1987,"All honesty what I would do is if you want to preserve what little credit you have is just send them what you can whether that be 5 to 10$ a month. So long as your paying something I don't think they can put it on your credit report as delinquent or non payment. They may hound you with phone calls, but least it will not impact your credit. "
allied1987,"One suggestion have you though about on the student loans trying to lower your payment? If they are though fed loan sign up for there IBR(Income based loans) lower payments will last a year and then you recertify and will adjust the rates, but that would give you a lot of relief and free up cash to help knock out other debt with. "
allied1987,"I really don’t know what to tell you. As some suggested getting raid of the car is easier then done and how American cities work you almost have to have one.  For the payday loans any collateral or just credit based? Payday loans are predatory by nature and are designed to keep you in. So drastic measures have to be taken. If no collateral, then to heck with it let it got bad and get yourself on your feet and then start paying what you can toward it if no collateral. If collateral then I would speak to a bankruptcy lawyer and claim bankruptcy on it. Lord knows will effect your credit for next 7 to 10 years but least you won’t be dealing with it for the next 7 to 10 years trying to get out of it.  "
allied1987,"All honesty to get raid of your medical, see if those hospitals have finical aid options. Being you have no income you should qualify for them and release you from the debt.  As far a starting a credit report I think you would need an SSN# first which would require you to become a citizen or become authorized to work in the US.  I don't know that process. 

&amp;#x200B;

Personally if your going to leave the country when you get done with school I would not bother.  If you plan on staying in the US after school. Then I would start the process of getting an SSN# and then work on building a credit report. "
allied1987,"It's a no brainer, I would go with company L. The work is guaranteed, closer commute and more money. I would take them up on their offer. Only person who is gonna look out for you is you. Always seek to better yourself and your family!"
allied1987,"Don’t let them go bad sounds like a bad debt relief company... try looking into incharge.org. They negotiate for you and close the cards, but don’t effect your credit badly at all. They give you 3 types of repayment based of your budget and you pay them and they disperse the payments for you to each of the creditors.

The company your going with now will damage your credit score longer in the long run then, but could reduce the total amount owed by negotiation. "
allied1987,Try talking to the hospital financial aid... see if you qualify for forgiveness. I did when I had my stroke totaled in to the 200k when all said and done. When  I called financial  Aid said I did not make enough and forgave every penny of it.
allied1987,"I understand completely I don’t want to be that person. Ether, but when they are predatory in nature. Some times you just have to walk away get a good footing and the pay back when you got the money to spare on your terms not there’s. So I would swap your direct deposit to a different bank  open an account some where else. So the cycle stops and they can’t take your money right when you get paid. Then after you get back on your feet if they are a local office I would then hand them the amount you can afford in cash. No check cause will have new routing number and account number on it. So cash only "
NotAnEnrolledAgent,"When you are paid as an independent contractor, you're basically self employed, which means you'll report any self employment income and expenses on a Schedule C, 1099 or not. Your net profit as calculated on the Sched. C will then go on the first page of your 1040."
NotAnEnrolledAgent,"Let me be a voice of dissent here. Speaking as someone who owed a significant amount of back taxes (approximately $144,000) I think you should get that debt cleared ASAP. $500 per month will have that $3500 wiped out by the end of summer. Put aside $1,000 as a ""starter"" emergency fund like Dave Ramsey suggests, then throw everything you can at the tax debt."
NotAnEnrolledAgent,Banks are weird. They'll allow your money to be taken in a millisecond by a merchant but it can sometimes take days for a credit to show up in your account. Depositing on Saturday probably means the check wasn't even processed until Monday night. Do you have a receipt from the ATM deposit?
NotAnEnrolledAgent,"If you don't have insurance, most hospitals will knock the bill down by at least 25%. Your mileage may vary, but like other replies say, you should contact the hospital and get on a payment plan. They'll work with you.

Edit: Also make sure you go over the charges line by line and make sure they're all legitimate and reasonable. A co-worker of mine got a $9K bill for a procedure his wife had done and it turned out somebody in the billing office fat fingered an account number and billed him for the wife' s procedure AND somebody else's."
polish94,"Cars are luxuries. As long as the car is working properly, every car does the same thing. Each car follows the same speed limits. Only difference is how fancy. 

I had twins in July, downgraded my AudiA5 into a Honda Insight. Purchase cost went from 25k to 5k. No loan, no interest, pocketed some cash. Best decision ever. Everything about it is cheaper, and its given me no problems in 30k miles over the last year."
polish94,"I have been with the same business my whole life, but moved around franchises. They gave me crap for buying a house to the new job. So even though my last 2 years were at 2 different jobs in 2 different states, they wanted to know I am safe with work and money after the move. I went tona franchise I part owned and wanted the ""owners"" confirmation of my wages. I literally attached the Operating Agreement with a letter from me showing what my planned income was. They pushed me through right away. 

TLDR; they will give you some crap, but its not the biggest hurdle. "
polish94,"The deal is amazing, I just blew 5k on driving a car for a year and reselling low cause I bought too expensive. Been driving a Honda insight for the past year, feels good. 

For 5k more, you wójt get much of an SUV. Sounds like the CRV was a hit, still strong. TheDX lasting this long is impressive. There are a few cars you can look at. I just bought a Mazda5 Minivan, its not fullsize. Twins on the way. Wife loves it. 3300/151k on it. Im guessing a 2010 with 150k is your BEST for 5k today. If you know mechanics, you just take your time finding a car that looks, sounds, and runs clean. "
polish94,"Everything should be okay running another hard pull if you aren't looking for another large purchase. Your credit score is only important the month or two prior to a large loan application, or new insurance, etc. You can take the hit, sit back for 4-6 months, and let it all repair itself. Credit scores aren't fixed, but extremely fluid. Just don't keep finding a reason to pull, but the pulls themselves aren't as harmful as what you are doing them for. "
polish94,"I had something similar. I moved from NC to IN and didn't know they needed the plate back. With no new address they sent my fee to collections. However, my people sent me a lot of info, and I verified with the NC DMV. I paid by Credit over the phone, haven't heard since. Emailed me confirmation. 

Just say no pay until paper proof. Good luck "
polish94,"I must have thought you cosigned. Technically she can sell you the car, but then you would get stuck with the taxes on buying a vehicle. I don't think its a gift as its unpaid. That's rough, maybe have her refinance as you cosign a new one, and then it might work. Talk to a banker, even at a different institution, and see if they can help you out because they would want you to move there. "

polish94,"I have PMI on two properties because we purchased our first home at minimum down payment, and since the home value skyrocketed in two years up to 22% and getting it removed after the 24 month mark in February. Mortgage is $920, PMI is $70 of it. Renting for $1150. The number aren't great looking, but its a very good tenant and I can raise rent slowly. That $70 is 25% of potential cash flow. 

My second home is also bought at minimum. The wife and I bought a larger home, twins on the way, etc. We have PMI $105/m. It sucks, but the home value rose quick too, but not 20%+  

For investing, its a bitch. If you're purchasing and planning to live there, its not the worst imo. "

Others are convinced when I charge $40/line and getting an account on your own costs 50-70 depending on company. I just work with/know every person and trust them to pay. They pay more than my bill total, leaves me free and profitable. "
polish94,"Inquiries don't matter like people think. Credit scores bounce all the time. At some point I had like 30 pulls in 24 months, and I was being approved for everything I needed at rates near bottom advertised. I've chilled since then, but it will go back up. Just give it 3 months. "
polish94,It is because you are having your credit pulled. It is not that big of a deal. People think that when you're score changes by a couple points that something bad can happen. Just make sure not to do anything for about six months prior to a large loan application.
polish94,"I believe you pay taxes depending on residence more than job location. When I add employees to payroll, it asks what county they work in, and if they live in it. If not, where do they live.

polish94,"There are tons of free online methods that break it all down for you. If its simple stuff, probably not. But until someone tells me where I can do my K1s/1099/investments and wife's w2 and maximize deductions properly, I have to use my CPA. "

"
picksomething74,"This publication from the Texas Comptroller gives an overview of the process:

[Property Taxpayer Remedies](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/property-tax/docs/96-295.pdf)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, the county will send out their ""Notice of Appraised Value"" sometime in the spring.  Seems like most counties also send out the Protest Form along with the value notice.  Most counties also have an Online Protest form that you can submit by using information from the Notice of Appraised Value.

&amp;#x200B;

You can protest the value yourself, or hire a property tax attorney.  Most of the time, if you don't know who will be doing your protest, you can submit another form at a later date to designate someone else if you choose to not do it yourself.

I always protested myself, but my in-laws often used Property Tax Attorneys.

&amp;#x200B;

When I lived near Houston, I did it myself and had good success using [Jubally](https://jubally.com/) to pull the data for me and create a report.  Once they have all the data from the county, you can enter your address to get Jubally's calculation of the value of your home.  In my experience, whatever value Jubally showed, they had data to back up that proposed value once I purchased the report.   Jubally says if the report can't get your value lowered, they will buy the report back from you.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are friends with a realtor, you might be able to get them to run a comp on your house.  Keep in mind that these comps and CMA method listed later typically are houses that have been recently updated, painted, renovated, etc.   Whereas your current house may not, and may be in need of repairs.  You can get contractor estimates for the repairs and updates needed to later present with your protest to help lower your value.

&amp;#x200B;

Per the state, there are 2 methods for calculation your appraised value: the Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) method and the Uniform and Equal (U&amp;E) method.    Whenever I used Jubally, they calculated and presented both analysis methods to me.   U&amp;E method typically show the lower value most often.

&amp;#x200B;

When you file your protest, most ppl seem to recommend to select both"" Value is over Market"" &amp; the ""Value is unequal compared with other properties"" options, and say you will present your information at your hearing along with your opinion of value.  Most seem to recommend to wait till the hearing to present your proposed value, and to not use the ""Online Settle / iSettle"" option.

&amp;#x200B;

Once you file your protest, both counties I have protested in had to show me what properties they are using for their analysis.  &lt;-- This is very helpful for you.  

You can see differences in the properties the county picked vs your report.  You can lookup the houses on Zillow or realestate websites and often still get the pics to see how the house has been updated compared to yours.  You can take those pics and pics of your un-updated house, and print them out and bring them with your to your protest hearing to justify your value.

The last time I protested with HCAD, I noticed that the comps HCAD used for the U&amp;E method had an average of 7 years turnover (between sales), whereas the Jubally report had comps with an average of 15 years turnover.  This meant that the homes HCAD had picked were being brought up to current market value much more often resulting in higher values that my home was compared against.   After pointing that out, the HCAD Appraiser accepted the value listed in my Jubally report.  My home value was lowered $25k which was around a 13% reduction compared to the initial HCAD value!

&amp;#x200B;

Sometimes you get a good County Appraiser that will really work with you at your informal protest hearing, and sometime you will get ones that are a huge dick.  So some years may be better than others.  That's why I protest every year.

I also stated write the Appraiser's names down in-case I can fill out a survey or try and request the good ones the following year. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

All in all, there is a lot you can do to lower your taxes with protesting.  Jubally's [FAQ](https://jubally.com/faqs#) page has lots of good info if you have other questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

You have nothing to lose but your time by filing the protest, but everything to gain if the county lowers your value

Again, if you live in a county that Jubally serves I highly recommend using them, and have had good luck.

&amp;#x200B;

Let me know if you got any other questions.

&amp;#x200B;"
picksomething74,"That’s interesting.   If that’s what you are concerned about, You could “roll your own” TDF with a DIY 3 or 4 fund portfolio.   That way you control the glide path from equities to bonds/cash.

Or you could select a later date TDF.

Also Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab, and others all have a different take on their TDF glide paths.   Some are gliding “to retirement “ and others are “through retirement age”.
For instance, Fidelity doesn’t start changing allocations in their INDEX TDF until about 20years before retirement age, and glides through the target year for about another 15-20 years before the allocation changes stop.

[Fidelity Freedom Index Glide Paths](https://www.fidelity.com/bin-public/060_www_fidelity_com/documents/SHDOCS/FIHFX/hosts/sh_comm_pmqa.002216.RETAIL_pdf.pdf) 

So for Fidelity's 2055 fund, it stays at close to 90% equities for another 15-20 years.

I’m interested in “cash flowing” my medical expenses in the HSA and not reimbursing myself until many years later to let the investment grow.   That way I could cover the gap if I want to retire early and when I can access my IRA/401k w/o tax penalties.   

Right now, I am comfortable with that path/allocation, but I plan to evaluate every couple of years and may potentially move to an earlier date TDF in my HSA."
picksomething74,"If you have the TDF in a tax advantaged account, then just sell it and get one of their zero fee index funds or checkout their Fidelity Freedom INDEX funds.  
The Freedom INDEX funds have a low ratio, ~0.14%, but not as low as their new Zero funds or their other index funds with lowered ER and minimums.


If it is in a taxable account, might want to consider short/long term capital gains implications of you sell the TDF."
picksomething74,"Yes.
Fidelity now offers a no fee HSA.  There are no monthly fees, and you can get a debit card linked to the account.
You can open an HSA @ Fidelity and then to a trustee transfer from Optum to Fidelity and then close your Optum HSA.

Fidelity also has $0 investment minimum on their HSA so you can have 100% of the HSA balance invested into one of their funds or ETFs."
picksomething74,"I recently opened a personal HSA at Fidelity and was able to purchase the Institutional Premium class of the Fidelity Freedom INDEX 2055 TDF at the lower ER without meeting the $100k minimum.

picksomething74,"I've had my Chase cards for years and they have never proactively offered me a CL increase.  I've had to ask for all of mine.

You can request a credit increase yourself on their website.
I've done it with Chase multiple times. I think Chase's CL increases are only a soft pull on your credit history, but Google to confirm.   
I remember that BoA CL increases were always a hard pull.  

You could also check your credit history at creditkarma.com and get a good estimate of your current score.  It's free."
picksomething74,"Additionally, if no one could use the 529 for education, you could still cash it out.    You could cash it out in the beneficiaries name (presumably a lower income tax bracket than you) to be taxed on the earnings + a 10% penalty on the earnings.

Taxes on the earnings+ 10% penalty is still better than no money, and the 529 has the benefit of tax free earnings if they ever need to use it for education."
picksomething74," If you are doing your own spreadsheet, why don't you just use the Previous Balance listed on your statement as the ""Baseline Balance""?

picksomething74,"It was easy.

I already had a investment account with Fidelity so it only took about 5min to add/open the HSA.

I started by doing a partial transfer (cash) from my OptumBank HSA.  I haven’t liquidated my investments since the market is down.

I initiated the transfer through Fidelity.   They have an electronic form that walks you through the info required. I printed and signed the form and submitted through Fidelity’s Secure Message instead of mailing.   
Fidelity took care of the rest.    Took about 3 weeks from when I submitted the form for the money to move to Fidelity from Optum and clear.


"
picksomething74,"Perfect!  




Again, if you want to protest yourself, I’d highly recommend to keep checking the Jubally site until they get the tax info from HCAD, and see what the new lower value Jubally says they have data to support.

Once you order your report, you should get unlimited refreshes throughout the year.   Often, my protest date wouldn’t be scheduled till mid August.   In the meantime, some of the comps HCAD and Jubally used would have their values lowered, so the end result would be my comp value would be lower too!

If you do it yourself, I’d highly recommend studying the details of Jubally report and getting familiar with the comps HCAD provides before you actually go into your protest hearing.   So you can walk the appraiser through the report, and steer them towards the info you want them to see.

HCAD always started off the protest hearing with “well what do you think your home would have sold for on January 1st of this year”.   And answer with the value you calculated based on your comps w/ repair estimates or Jubally report value.

Even if the report says they can only lower the value by $500, use that chance to protest to get familiar with actually negotiating the comps with the HCAD agent and the feel for everything.
Then, next year when HCAD jacks your appraisal up 10% you’ll know the ropes and be ready for the protest.

Also, having the homestead exemption filed puts a cap on the max amount HCAD can increase their appraisal each year.




"
ImNotNotKevin,"Are you telling them what your current salary is? And are you telling them ""I don't want to make a lateral move""?

If you're doing either of those things, my first piece of advice would be to not do that. The first just puts you at a disadvantage in negotiations, the second just makes you look a little arrogant to the recruiter.

If you're worried about asking for too much, do some research on what that position pays in your industry. Glassdoor is ok for giving you a rough (and I mean very rough) approximation of this."
ImNotNotKevin,"Here’s the thing - you will (almost) never be worse off making more money. Yeah you might not be able to contribute into a Roth IRA, but you can still save that money in a savings, taxable brokerage, etc. You’ll pay tax on it, but that’s still more than never having earned it in the first place."
ImNotNotKevin,"Well that’s the thing - the formula used to calculate credit score isn’t public. We know roughly what effects credit score (utilization, hard checks, etc) but we don’t know how they’re weighted. I don’t know your credit history so I don’t know what info would be pertinent, but what I do know increases score is a lower utilization rate and fewer hard checks.

Also the line between good and excellent credit is more around 740 from what I know, and again based off the info provided I don’t see why your score would fall below any kind of excellent standard. Scores fluctuate and most of the time we don’t know why exactly."
ImNotNotKevin,"You can either keep it in your old 401k until you can roll it into your new one, or roll it into an IRA. Some people suggest rolling it into an IRA so you have more freedom to choose what to invest in and continue to grow the account with contributions, but if you have a mix of traditional and Roth contributions you might want to keep it as a 401k if you need to/are close to needing to use backdoor Roth method.

I think some employers charge a fee if you keep it with them after leaving, although I'm not too sure about that. You might want to double check."
ImNotNotKevin,"Does your employer pay you twice a month or biweekly? If your monthly salary works out to $3,500 per month, that means you make 42,000 annually. If they’re paying you biweekly, that means you’ll get 26 paychecks a year, and $42,000 divided by 26 is $1,615.39z"
ImNotNotKevin,"Yes, you read the books to develop a strategy... and then why not use fake money to test it out rather than real money? Also your point was to not invest in stocks at all and not to ""waste time with simulators"", which is what I disagreed with."
ImNotNotKevin,"500k is the limit of SIPC insurance, so as of this moment it’s fine but if that amount starts to grow substantially then it might be worth it for him to look into a second broker. Edward Jones is pretty reputable though so I wouldn’t worry too much about it."
ImNotNotKevin,"Yes, you do have to meet all of them. So while you do meet the student part (you only need to be a full-time student for any 5 months of the year) it seems they didn't provide half your support, and you definitely didn't live with them for at least 6 months since you moved in June."
ImNotNotKevin,"Vanguard's a huge company. This is obviously horrible and says a lot about the quality of their internal controls (or lack thereof) but it was seemingly just one employee. Fraud happens at big institutions, and if Vanguard users wanted to shift their money they could, but they certainly don't need to."
ImNotNotKevin,"I use credit cards but treat them like a debit card - I don’t spend more with them than I have/fits in my budget. The immediate bonus for you would be rewards - if you pay off your cc before the due date, it’s basically an interest free short term loan you make money off of. In the long term, while you might not need credit for an apartment, you will need it to get a mortgage for a house. And having a longer credit history will help you there.

You don’t have to get a credit card, but honestly there’s no real reason not to as long as you pay off your balance on time. It’s a benefit for you even."
ImNotNotKevin,"So a 401k is a type of account through your employer, and you can't get one solo (unless you're self-employed) - an IRA is an Individual Retirement Account, so that would be your ""solo"" option here. Does your employer offer both Roth and Traditional 401k options? That's your taxed now vs. taxed later question, not whether it's a 401k or IRA.

If I were you, I'd contribute to both but have your employer contribution go to your IRA because you have more freedom in what to invest there."
ImNotNotKevin,"Buffett’s already basically selected his successors - Ajit Jain and Greg Abel. And besides, from everything I can tell of Buffett I don’t think he would ever want an outsider hired into the top spot. Not that I think Dimon would ever even leave - it’s hard to beat being the JP Morgan CEO."
ImNotNotKevin,"Your bills don’t matter - if when you filled out your W-4 when you started work you chose to take two exemptions (as a single filer with no dependents) you’ll have close to the correct amount withheld from your paycheck, and most likely you’ll be due for a refund. So you should be good!"
ImNotNotKevin,"1. Yes, you can put any amount into a fund at a time, as index funds offer fraction shares. Look for a minimum investment some funds have however.

2. Depends on your broker - for example, if I tried to buy a Vanguard fund through Fidelity, they would charge me a transaction fee. But if I bought Fidelity funds through Fidelity, there would be no transaction fee.

3. ETF’s don’t have fractional shares, so you would have to have enough money to buy at least one whole share. Based on what you’ve asked, I’d recommend a mutual fund."
ImNotNotKevin,"If you truly don't plan to need it or touch it, I'd say a Roth IRA as that'll also let you make additional contributions up to the annual limit. I'd avoid CD's in this specific instance, as they generally don't let you make additional deposits. "
ImNotNotKevin,"As someone else said, we don’t know why based off the information you’ve given. Try paying off some of your monthly expenditures early so your utilization rate is lower next month. Otherwise wait for that hard check to roll off and for your avg account age to increase. That’s about all you can do at this point.

Also, while you said you don’t want people saying “don’t worry, you have great credit” I’d like to point out you yourself said in your post “It is not like I am going to apply for credit any time soon but I still want to be able to if needed”. Having a 777 versus an 802 will not change the interest rates you are offered, that’s 100% known. So while you may not want to hear it, your credit is great and you shouldn’t worry."

tec42,"Research and ask around for some good lenders near you so that you can decide on one. Most lenders will run your credit with all 3 big dogs (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) and will either avg your scores OR take the middle score. As far as preapproval... They usually give you 60-90 days before you have to reapply. FYI-- it also looks better when you're buying to be preapproved already. "
tec42,"Typically you get a 6 month grace period for your student loans and 24k is not bad. If you have nothing lined up, I would be calling your old retail job up.

Don't worry about your GPA... nobody will ask you after your first job... they shift focus on your performance at your current job.

My first order of business would be paying of the CC asap. Then i would look into your student loans and start paying your highest % loan off first. "
tec42,"Based on your info provided, I would guess an approval of $100-150k. They will run your credit and avg the three scores. Varies a little by company/bank, but you will most likely have to provide:  2-3 years of Tax returns and W2s, Last three months of bank statements, Show how much current CC balances are, list anything else like Student loans, etc. Depending on your credit, you might have to provide more.

The down payment will def help, but I would maybe consider holding on to some of that $$$$ if that's all your saving. As a home owner, it cost a lot to furnish and you will start to find a lot of stuff needs to be fixed/repaired/updated.... or maybe to buy a ring :) "
tec42,Pay that off and get it off your credit ASAP. You can reach out to the company and see which agency they sent to and I believe it will show you on a Credit report too. You can also negotiate with the collection agency. Just make sure you get the proper paperwork from the agency when you pay it off.

tec42,"New job, Changing from Fidelity to Vangaurd I have about $40k in my 401(k) (Fidelity, before tax contributions) from my previous employer. My new employer uses Vanguard for 401(k) which I was eligible for after my 6th month with the company. After 1 year of employment, I'm eligible for profit sharing contributions and 3% 401(k) match. Vanguard/my company offers employee after-tax, employee pre-tax and employee roth. ***Should I roll my old 401(k) to my new 401(k) OR to an IRA?***

My best friend has been a financial adviser for 5+ years (rare one that does not call on or pressure his friends/family). He mentioned that he would personally go the roth route (with Vanguard or dif fin company) because it gives you more flexibility/control.  He also mentioned out side of a company sponsored plan, a FA might give some more oversight and all you to be more responsive to evolving market conditions.  I am currently doing 10% under pre-tax, but he recommended I change the 10% to roth instead. 

I trust my friend because he gives me honest opinions (not opinions to push me to invest with him), but I thought I would get other peoples thoughts and opinions. Obviously if I decided to go outside of my company plan (vangaurd) with my $40k, i would want to give him/his company the business. 

Thanks for the help!

tec42,"When I was in college, I only worked during breaks back in my home town. My goal wasn't saving up, it was saving what I had. I set a daily limit of $15 max I could spend. If I only used $10, I would put $5 towards another day, date night with the gf, drinks with the boys, etc. It helped limit how much I was spending at bars and eating out. Eventually you'll start to become aware and not have to keep track. 

My biggest tip for paying off loans..... A lot of loans have different rates, so go in to pay off the highest % ones first bc they are costing you the most interest. 

Is it possible to get a job back home and live with the rents for a year or two? That would help you save up money."
persondude27,"Is this a joint card or an authorized user card? In a joint card, you're both responsible for the bills. As an AU, you can both spend on it, but only the responsible party is responsible for the debt (and only the AU can be removed).

That said - if you want off the card, call the bank to let them you know you want to close the card. If you're a joint user, you'll need a zero balance. An AU shouldn't."

persondude27,"If you have 11 accounts, you need to come to terms with the fact that this won't go away quickly. But, the good news for you is that if they aren't actively calling or sending letters, it will probably go away on its own.

This situation isn't uncommon and is called 'bad debt'. You're not hurting the company more than you did originally. Even if you were to settle this account, the money probably wouldn't go to the original company. Chances are they sold it to another collections agency, who buy bad debt for a faction of what it's worth and then try to collection any money at all on it.

So, frankly, spend any of this money on getting yourself into a better place rather than helping a company make more money. They already used it as a tax write off.

Take your time and work on it. You won't be buying a house in the short term, so don't stress about it right now."
persondude27,"On your credit card or bank statement, there should be a 'details' on each line item. It should have the company that originated the charge and a phone number.

You can also block recurring charges with your bank, but if it does turn out to be something else, the company you have an agreement with can come after you for not cancelling. Gyms, for example, are notorious for that.

Also... Time is $5 at the newsstand. It'd be shocked if they were charging you $30 a month for it."
persondude27,"You can file a different W4 claiming more dependents to reduce your withheld taxes, then bump it back up after the bonus is paid out.

Gotcha, my mistake!"
persondude27,"OK, solid. That'll be just fine - 12-15% doesn't look as good on your credit as 0-9% utilization, but it's still just fine. It'll only be worth 10-20 points. 

If you do ever plan on using your score (applying for another card, car or student loan, etc), pay your card down to zero just before the statement date so it maximizes your credit score."
persondude27,"$25K on a CC, huh?

There's no harm in asking. Discover's It and Chase Freedom have both offered me balance transfers at zero-percent years after the card was opened.

It's the friendly-type call. Also, you likely want to call them immediately before the purchase and let 'em know you're spending five figures on the card on [this date] since it sounds like it's not part of your normal spending pattern."
persondude27,"That's correct, but it still takes up to two months to bring your score back up after having high utilization.

The whole point of having access to credit is that it buys you flexibility, which you're denying yourself by saying ""I would have a much better score in 6-8 weeks as soon as the card I paid off today reports to my history.""

My roommate did late last month - he was in a car accident and went to buy a new car. He walked into the dealership and happened to have paid for a company business trip (almost $8,000) the month before. He'd already paid it off his card, but the card hadn't reported to the agencies yet. His score was shoddy, and so he had to finance the car at 5.5% instead of the 2-3% he should've qualified for.

I'm a huge fan of the 'set it and forget it' method of building credit."
persondude27,"I'd go off the fact that it was unexpected - generally, the steps before garnishment include service to bring you before a court and get the judgement, then another court date for a discovery of financial assets.

Either of those court dates would've been the proper time to ask the judge to limit the amount of the garnishment since it sounds like this has put you in hardship. Very few judges would order a garnishment that will leave you starving, so you might be able to have the judgement modified.

Bankruptcy is a bit extreme in that $8,000 really isn't that much money. How big is the debt that was successfully attached?"
persondude27,"Not to be rude, what Emunster18 looks for in a credit card vs. what I look for in a credit card vs. what you look for in a credit card are totally different.

I would recommend a card with no annual fee.

I don't value travel rewards because I already travel so much, but I do spent a significant amount of money on travel that my company then reimburses. So, I have a cashback card.

The Freedom Unlimited is a straight cashback card. While Chase does have nice cards (I have three), consider whether it's the best deal for you. In my case, the Citi Doublecash has 2.0% unlimited cashback (Freedom Unlimited has 1.5%, or 25% less). I have a regular Freedom which has rotating categories of 5%. Right now, the 5% is on gas/drugstores and will be switching to on March 15th to something new.

If they do, you can follow the steps listed in our wiki on [collections](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections) to request debt validation and dispute the debt.

Under the FDCPA, you can also request (in writing) that they no longer contact you.

Whatever you do, don't offer to pay the debt, offer to pay any portion of it, or acknowledge that you 'might' be responsible for the debt. As of right now, there's nothing they can do to you."

* Luggage insurance. If your baggage doesn't arrive, go replace the things in your luggage and send Visa the bill.
* Travel delay insurance: if your flight is delayed more than 6 hours, go get a hotel. File a reimbursement claim with Visa.

If you travel more than a little bit, it's a no-brainer to put all the travel on one of these cards.

Not really needed. You can do this on your own and save a bit of money. The IRS doesn't really care where your income comes from, as long as you pay taxes on it.

If you make under $66,000 a year, you probably qualify for [free filing](https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/).

TurboTax, TaxAct, etc would be able to handle this. I am in a similar position with a W2 and 1099 (although no one would pay to see me dance), and use TurboTax each year. It's a bit more expensive but I feel like it's easy-to-use.

TurboTax, specifically, runs about $130 a year - more expensive than the other options - because you have to use the Self-Employed to file a Schedule C (itemizing deductions for your 1099)."

Seriously though, your state may have un-winding laws on contracts like this. You may be able to remove the warranties. If that is possible, you would likely need to sign more paperwork and work out another loan.

If your total principal on the car is $31,500, you will need to pay more than $1300 / month to pay it off. Sounds like your payment covers about $375 of that, but a portion of that is interest. So you're looking at $1500 / ish a month to kill it in two years."
persondude27,"If you're interested in cashback, consider opening something like a Cash Sapphire Preferred (which has a $500 signup bonus with $4,000 minimum spend) and putting the card on there. It gets unlimited 1% cashback on all items - so you'd get $750 cash back. Then, close the card at 11 months so you don't pay the $95 annual fee that's waived the first year.

That said, paying any interest at all on the item eats up savings way faster than the 1% adds up. On most of these cards, interest rates are 22-25%, which is roughly 2% per month. That means that a paying interest for a SINGLE month costs you double what the cashback was.

It sounds like you're violating the #1 rule of credit cards: never carry a balance."
Dr_Pippin,"Few quick thoughts on how I would address these things before I head to bed:

Continue doing 6% into your 401k to get the full company match. 

Start a Roth IRA and max it out every year. 

Do not change your living habits at all and put every extra dollar you make toward those student loans. I would set a goal of paying off half of your student loans in 18 months. 

You need an emergency fund. $1K isn’t enough. You should be able to cover at minimum 3 months of living expenses. 

As for house purchasing, I wouldn’t rush into it with a boyfriend (fiancée/husband is a different story). The economy *appears* to be heading toward a downturn in the next couple of years (historically the US is a boom and bust economy, so it would be ridiculous to think that for some reason something different would happen now), which would make me leery of buying a house while the market is up when there’s a likely “down” on the way.

When are you eligible to sell your company’s stock? I would sell it when able and make a more diversified portfolio. Keeping some of your company’s stock isn’t a terrible idea, but you definitely don’t want all your eggs in one basket. "
Dr_Pippin,"I’m debt averse and would write the check tomorrow to pay it off. That said, you have a very low interest rate and you could potentially gain more by investing that 20K. If you’re not going to invest it, though, and it would just sit in the bank account untouched then there’s no reason to not pay off your mortgage. "
Dr_Pippin,"Surgeries typically will entail numerous different bills from different providers - surgeon, hospital, anesthesia, etc.

As for why you’re paying each visit, if you were told the price covered all follow up appointments then to me you shouldn’t be paying unless there are medications, etc. that are additional. "
Dr_Pippin,"You’re welcome. It’s really good that you’re starting to want to learn these things now and start working toward your retirement. Remember, invested money approximately doubles every 10 years (with a well-diversified portfolio, etc). So $1 invested now is $16 when you’re in your mid-60’s. Investing early makes a huge difference. "
Dr_Pippin,Fix yours. And get a better price. Find an exhaust shop that will weld in a universal catalytic converter. Autozone has universal cats for under $100. It’s not hard for an exhaust shop to cut out some pipe and weld in some new pipe with a cat in it. 
Dr_Pippin,"The only thing I didn’t see considered is an emergency fund. 

I would also encourage you to buy a car outright with cash if feasible. A ten year old Honda is still a very reliable vehicle. Don’t set yourself up with a car payment if you can avoid it. "
Dr_Pippin,"I don’t know what other work your car needs, but you can go to an exhaust shop and have them weld in a new aftermarket catalytic converter for pretty cheap. Heck, I have known of people who have gone to a “cash-only” type exhaust shop and have them remove the cat completely and weld in a straight pipe for &lt;$100 when finances are really tight and they needed to solve a catalytic converter issue. "
Dr_Pippin,"That depends on your relationship with him. If I needed to move back with my parents for some reason they’d let me do it in heartbeat and wouldn’t expect me to pay anything.

Do you actually need the money for bills? Can you just be supportive and help him?"
Dr_Pippin,"I’d write the check and pay off CC2 in a heartbeat. Hell, I’d probably write two checks and pay them both off at the same time then live like a pauper for the next 3 months to rebuild my emergency fund. "
Dr_Pippin,"&gt; Should my emergency fund be separate from my savings account? I have a second debit account that I don’t have a debit card for and I usually use it when I’m saving up for a weekend trip or something. Is that a good spot to have an emergency fund?

An emergency fund can be wherever you want it to be, just so long as you don't use it for unnecessary purchases and it is readily available.  It is usually easiest mentally to have it separated into a separate account that you don't touch.

&gt;  Thanks for the car advice. I will admit I’m just tired of having a super old car. It’s a Honda and I’ve taken care of it the whole time I’ve had it but I would like for once to be able to have something nicer. I will try to save up more and pay in cash if I can. I don’t really like having payments either but if I don’t replace the catalytic converter I will probably need to either fix it or buy a new car within the year. I’m looking at Subaru outbacks, I’ve heard Subarus are pretty reliable too. Any thoughts?

Do you have vehicle inspections that you're worried about failing with the catalytic converter?

In my opinion, you can't beat Honda reliability.  I don't have any first hand experience with Subarus. I had an employee that purchased an Outback thinking it was going to be reliable and unfortunately he very quickly had to put a fair bit of money into it.  I think it's been pretty good since, but that's just an N of 1, so hardly anything to take as gospel."
Dr_Pippin,"Whenever I see these sorts of questions and there’s a statement about credit card debt, my mind goes into overdrive yelling, “Pay off the credit card. Pay off the credit card. Pay off the credit card.” Unless you have a super low introductory rate, revolving credit should be paid in full every month (I’m assuming that’s not what you’re doing when you say you make regular payments)."

iFailedPreK,"What's your best suggestion to manage budgets? So currently, I have a budget plan with all my current expenses and income. I'm currently saving between 68% - 70%. I plan to have a large sum of cash by the End of This Year for investment purposes. What I want to know, is what's the best way to approach this. and by this, I mean my current Weekly/Monthly Spending Allowance. I gave myself a Weekly Allowance of around $20 - $25. Doesn't mean I will spend it all, just in case I want to buy some food or other supplies. I currently am in a household where I do not have to worry about food.

I currently have a College Chase Checking Account and an Ally Savings Account. All my Savings will go to Ally and everything else to Chase. But, my question is, how should I manage my Weekly Allowance? Should I just leave it in the Checking Account along with the money I need for Bills? Or is there a more convenient way of storing my money solely for Allowances. Without cashing out.

Essentially, I am taking the total amount of my Weekly Paycheck for my **Monthly Bills + Allowance Every Week**, and putting the rest into Savings. Example, my current Monthly Bills are $380 for Rent/Phone. Plus $100 for my Weekly Allowance. ($100 / 4 = $25) So for each paycheck, I keep $120 and deposit the rest into my Savings.

**BUT**, I'm basically asking if there is a better way to manage the Allowance so that it isn't with my money for Bills so that I can keep better track of it. Or should I just write it down like I'm currently doing?

I apologize for any confusion I may have given you. If you need more answers, or for me to clarify, don't hesitate to ask. Thank you for your time."

How can you do the math to figure out when you might hit that number? I am invested in target date funds and was thinking expecting an average 4% market return seemed reasonable. How can I calculate roughly when I’ll be able to afford to retire?
Derangedandconfused,"Too Much in Retirement? I’m 33 years old with $35,000 currently invested in retirement. I got a late start to saving and I currently have 6.4% of my salary going into a pension, 19% into an employer sponsored 457b and I get a 3% employer match. My salary is currently $53k per year and I can easily contribute this much to retirement without struggling financially. Is there any reason I shouldn’t put such a percentage aside for retirement?"
Derangedandconfused,"Do not underestimate the cost of home repairs. My husband and I had saved up a 20% down payment for a structurally solid 30 year old house and couldn’t believe how much money we had to shell out to up keep it the first two years. When you own the house you’re responsible for everything - furnace, hot water heater, windows, carpet, landscaping.... I can’t say I’d been keen to take on the amount of work and expense you’re alluring to for three years time. "
Derangedandconfused,"I have a 40-60 minute commute depending on traffic. I use the time to listen to music, listen to podcasts, listen to books on tape, call my family and friends, etc. I’ve actually gotten so used to having “me” time during my commute that any time I need to carpool it completely wrecks my day. "
Derangedandconfused,"I am also a public school teacher in Michigan and have done a ton of research on retirement recently. To answer questions, it would depend on what the 403 has for funds and what the fees on that account are. The target date funds have killer expense ratios in the state 457 which is what you are automatically invested in unless you have changed it. The fees are also very low. I almost opened a Roth 403b to diversity my taxes, but decided not to because I will likely use less money in retirement than I do right now and the 403 was laden with fees."
Derangedandconfused,"Got it! Was not familiar with that phrasing. 

Depends on where you live (prices), how much you cook, and where you like to eat. 

I save a ton of money taking advantage of my grocery store’s discounts, clipping coupons on their app, and cooking at home. I stock up on things I know I’ll use when they are on sale. Not sure what type of storage you have available but I will sometimes have 8 loaves of bread in my freezer and 10 boxes of cereal in the pantry. Whenever I try to save money for something I significantly reduce eating out. I didn’t realize how much money I was spending on dining until I added it all up. 

At the moment I budget $200 for groceries and up to $100 for eating out. There have been times when I was eating out once a week but have also cut back to once a month or less when I was trying to save. 

Wanted to add that I also buy a lot of fresh produce and prioritize eating well. I won’t compromise my health to save a few dollars. "
Derangedandconfused,Bad Roth IRA? I opened a Roth IRA in 2011 with PNC and I’m finally actually looking into how it works and wondering if that was a good choice? I currently have 100% allocation in Blackrock Global Allocation Class A which has a gross expense ratio of .91% and a net expense ratio of .84%. This is high right? I tried looking on PNC’s investment website and I can’t find a list of possible investment choice like I can in my employer sponsored 457 plan. How do I figure out what is better? Did I make a poor choice choosing PNC? Does it matter? Can I move it somewhere else if it does matter? 
Derangedandconfused,"Thank you so much for posting. Okay after some investigating, I have discovered my 457 is invested 100% in state street target date 2050. Is this good? Bad? From what I understand this target date fund is already pretty diverse? How do you know if something has a low expense ratio? "
Derangedandconfused,"IRA -Confusing I currently have a Roth IRA that I am ineligible to contribute to because my husband and I file taxes separately and are over the income limits.

I have a457b account through work and the options are not great. I was wondering if it would be worth opening an IRA and maxing out the IRA before contributing more than what I need for the employer match to the 457b? 

However, I can’t seem to figure out how you fund an IRA - it’s supposed to be pre-tax so does it come off of your paycheck? I’m not eligible for a deduction on any IRA contributions. Is it worth opening an IRA or should I stick with the 457b?"
Derangedandconfused,"There are two separate websites. When you go to the pension plus website and you go to log in there is a place to click for investment account and a place to click for the pension account. You will need to have a special number to login to the pension account for the first time. I had to click on something and get them to send me the number in the mail. If you hired the same year as me you have $10,000 sitting in that account right now."
Derangedandconfused,"Of course increasing income is going to help, but that is often easier said than done.

A few other things I just thought of:

Have you price compared insurance rates? Is it possible there is something less expensive?

At $400 for rent I’m  assuming you either live with someone else or live in an extremely rural area. I’m assuming this includes monthly bills like water, electric, internet, etc.?

Is it possible to share a phone plan with someone or switch carriers to get a better rate?"
Derangedandconfused,"I have worked overseas and I’m going to point out some things to consider independently of the money.

If this is a start up company they could fold. What will you do when you are stranded in India with no job? Are there benefits? How will you get healthcare while you are there? Do you speak the local language? If not, how much English is spoken in that area. If you’ve never lived overseas don’t take for granted that you won’t even be able to read street signs or food labels in the grocery store. How long is the contract? How will you find housing? Is it provided by the company? What is that housing like? 

If you are really interested in living overseas do your homework and make sure you are working with a reputable company or organization. I heard horror stories of people who went to work for a private organization and got stuck with horrid work conditions, work hours, or no pay. I worked through a government program and had free housing and health care as well as a guaranteed job with strict guidelines for working conditions and hours as well as an excellent salary. "
Derangedandconfused,Retirement - what next? I have learned that my employer 457b plan is 100% invested in State Street Target Date 2050. The ER is .07. Should I leave it ride this way or is there something else I should be doing to diversify and grow this account? 
vikramjatt11,"In this case, yes!

If you plan on doing this for the long run (which you definitely should, it's free money for having money! lol), then you will have to read the terms for each bank, each bank has their own definition of a direct deposit and what all is needed to get the bonus, avoid monthly fees, etc. But NEVER bank with these bonus banks, keep your actual bank account at a local credit union with no fees (as you are planning on doing), just use these banks for free money.

&amp;#x200B;

I keep an excel sheet of what day I opened an account and at what bank and what day I closed the account.

This helps a lot. For example, the Citizens Bank fine print says ""no accounts with us in the past 6 months"", meaning you can open this account, get the bonus, close your account, wait 6 months from close date, rinse and repeat. The excel sheet helps you know when you closed your account and when you can repeat.

It's even better if you and your spouse both do it with separate accounts (double the free money!). And it's *even better* at banks that offer a referral bonus on top of the sign up bonus. So you sign up, wait a few days and refer your spouse and then you get 3 things: your sign up bonus, your referral bonus (usually $50-$100), and your spouses sign up bonus."
vikramjatt11,"Try to do it yourself first on a free website such a Credit Karma and see what numbers you get, but do not submit (file). The software will guide you step by step through each and item. You can download the filled out forms in a single PDF without submitting (filing) in the end.

Then go to an accountant and have them file your taxes this year, do not tell them you tried it yourself and do not give them the PDF you have. If their numbers match and/or are super close to yours then you know you did everything correctly on your side. You can also compare their PDF to yours to see where the differences are.

You can then use this information and decide if you want to continue to use an accountant next year or do it yourself."
vikramjatt11,"&gt;The idea of investing to grow money interests me, but from looking at IRAs and how you only make like $500 after three years, it just doesn't seem worth it

Your growth depends on your dollar amount invested. If you invest $2,000 and it grows 8% (average) annually then yes, you will have gained $519 in three years.

If you invest $10,000 and let it grow for three years at 8% (average) annually then you gained $2,597 in three years.

&amp;#x200B;

All at 8% annual returns:

If you put in $500/month for three years. After three years, your principle is $18,000 and your interest is $1,478. But since investing is a long term game, you are supposed to think of a 20-40 years timeframe.

If you continue to invest that $500/month for 20 years. At the end, your principle is $120,000 and your gains are $154,571 for a grand total of $274,571.

If you continue to do that for 40 years, your principle is $240,000 and your gains are $1,314,339 for a grand total of $1,554,339.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a long term goal you need to set and the part you are missing is called compound interest. [Here is a compound interest calculator](https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator) you can mess around with.

&amp;#x200B;"
vikramjatt11,"&gt;once you start paying interest on a card balance, ALL purchases on the card start accruing interest immediately.

Until your balances once again comes down to $0. Once you are back to $0, you can charge the card, wait for statement, and pay the entire statement balance (not minimum payment) by the statement due date without incurring any interest.

&amp;#x200B;"
vikramjatt11,"You can do a international Euro trip for much cheaper than $7k.

There are flights from the east coast and midwest to multiple cities in Europe for under $500 round trip. Once you are in Europe, you can take a cheap train anywhere in the EU. You can do a week Euro trip for under $3k-4k total including flights if you don't do a cruise.

What is the point of a cruise in Europe anyways? You're on the water most of the time and don't even get to go around more than a few hours or day at most.

The $7k is only an issue because you are not left with enough of an emergency fund afterwards. If you **have** to do the cruise, it is a better idea to save the $7k first specifically for the cruise instead of depleting your emergency fund for a vacation (since a vacation is not an emergency)."
vikramjatt11,"Pros:  
\- Most states offer tax credit for 529 contributions

\- Money can grow for 18-25 years. $100/month for 18 years = \~$37,000 at 7%.

&amp;#x200B;

Cons/not really cons:

\- If child does not attend college.

Solution: It can be used for trade school for your child. Beneficiary can also be changes to another child and/or a long list of family members that are eligible for the money.

\- Child did not attend college and you do **not** want to give the money to a family member (niece/nephew, etc.)

Solution: Your principle comes out as-is, no issues. You just pay taxes on the interest you earned over the years. No big deal, same as investing in the market with a brokerage account."
vikramjatt11,The College Savings account penalty should not be 10% on the *entire amount.* You should be able to pull your your principle (amount you contributed) penalty free. It is the *interest earned* on the principle that you will have to pay the 10% penalty and taxes on.
vikramjatt11,"You are looking at the total tax rate (23.74%) since you said your last check was $604 post-taxes.

You need to look at the breakdown of taxes and see what was taken out for federal taxes; fed withholding, medicare , and oasdi. Federal taxes are not based on your location within the U.S.

Then you need to look at your state taxes; Maryland withholding and County withholding.

You need to use this calculator to determine if your W4 amounts are correct:  [https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/](https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/)"
vikramjatt11,"Yes, it is a smart choice to put your emergency fund and short term savings (house down payment, car down payment, etc.) in a high interest savings account.

&gt; would it be better in an index fund? 

No, this is too high risk for goals that are under 10-15 years away.

&amp;#x200B;"
vikramjatt11,"&gt;never hurts to be over prepared

In my opinion, the best way to *over prepare* is to put 3-5% of your weekly/bi-weekly/monthly 401k/IRA/etc. contributions into bonds (you can also put money in a high interest savings account with the same goal). That goal is for when the inevitable market downturn comes, your reserves are ready to buy into the market at a discounted rate (either all at once or over a period of time in the downturn (dollar cost averaging)).

&amp;#x200B;"
vikramjatt11,"If that is the case, I would recommend doing some kind of side gig if you do not already have one. 

Then opening a individual 401k and transferring all your previous employer 401k funds into your solo 401k. This would be the preferred method over transferring it into your next employers 401k."
vikramjatt11,"Unfortunately Amazon changed this 3-4 years ago. The automated allowance minimum is now $5 but if you manually reload the minimum is 50 cents.  


Amazon is where I make my 10 monthly ""purchases"" to keep my High Interest valid. I have a reminder set in my phone for the 1st of every month to reload 10 times, it comes out to $5 total. On the other hand if I set it up for automatic allowance it will come out to $50/month, I don't use Amazon that much."
vikramjatt11,"I do this about 8 times a year with different banks and make around $1,600 - $3,000 from bonuses depending on the bank and bonuses. As long as you read all the requirements and don't have to pay any monthly fees, you're good.

I keep an excel sheet with information such as: bank name, date account opened, whose name (mine of wifes), length account needs to remain open, account close date. One of the conditions is usually ""cannot have account with the bank in the previous 180 days"" (or 12 months in some cases). The excel sheet helps me know exactly when I opened/closed what account and when I can repeat the process.

You will receive a 1099-INT from them (the following year) and have to pay taxes on the money."
vikramjatt11,"Everyone is giving their positive experiences, I'll give my negative; Ally Bank never opened my account after I submitted all my paperwork. I waited about 4 weeks with no response from them.

In the end, I opened my savings accounts with Discover Bank. It took about 2 minutes and all my savings accounts and credit card account are in 1 unified placed on the Discover app."
vikramjatt11,"&gt;Any benefits to rolling into my next employer's account?

No, this is a bad idea 99.99% of the time. Employer 401k expense ratios are (almost) always higher than what you can get by going directly to the source (Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, etc.) .

&gt;Any benefits to going out on my own?

Yes, lower expense ratios and a central location to always put your employer 401k as you change jobs throughout your life. Anytime you change employers, you rollover the previous 401k into this one central account with low expense ratios. Plus your HR people at the company won't know how much $$ you have in your 401k, always a good thing. Never trust HR, they may give you smaller raises because they think you're doing well or they think you're loaded, you just never know with HR.

&gt;Does anyone have advice on how to handle the 401K transition?

Yes, open a Traditional IRA account yourself, I prefer Vanguard. Then initiate a ""trustee to trustee"" transfer to go from your employer to your Vanguard Traditional IRA. It will take 1-2 weeks, your employers 401k company will mail a check to Vanguard, Vanguard will deposit the funds into your account. Then, with Vanguard, you can invest the money into the index funds of your choice.

Call Vanguard once you establish the account, they will help you with the process of initiating the trustee to trustee transfer. They are very helpful."
vikramjatt11,"In most likely has to do with their commission fees, they may be higher than other brokerages. 

However, for a scenario like yours where you want to invest in a total stock market fund, you can utilize one of Vanguard commission-free funds.

All of vanguard's own funds are commission-free."
vikramjatt11,"&gt; Is it possible to transfer those funds from the old account into the new one or even better, into her IRA account?   
&gt;  
&gt; Can we do something similar with this or does she really have to leave or retire to move that money out? 

This is a question you need to ask the plan administrator for the old 401k. If they are saying the money is stuck until you quit or retire then you may be out of luck. I would ask them if they can do a trustee-to-trustee transfer.

&gt; I know if you leave a job, you can make a withdrawal and as long as the money is redeposited into a qualifying account, there are no penalties. 

It's called a trustee-to-trustee transfer (that is the best way to do it) and you are not involved in the money handling in any manner. You initiate the transfer from your current 401k to your IRA company as a trustee-to-trustee transfer and the money is sent directly into your IRA account once the new administrator receives the money.

vikramjatt11,"The automatic allowance reload is $5 minimum/transaction.

The manual gift card reload is minimum $0.50 minimum/transaction.

&gt; so if i only have 1 card i want to do this with it would only load 5$ a month then correct? 

Are you wanting to do 10 transactions or 1 transaction?

Yes, it would be $5/month added to your Amazon account if you setup an allowance for 1 transaction of $5/month.

Yes, it would be $5/month added to your Amazon account if you manually do 10 transactions transaction of $0.50/each 10 times/month.

vikramjatt11,"If your income is 5 - 10 million then that is only 5 - 10 % of your yearly income.

Your expenses at that point will be much higher due to availability of money to you, so it is not actually that much cash on-hand. In the end it is all your opinion.

&gt;What if I want to flex and buy a Hermes bag in cash?

If you have that kind of money, the only scenario where you'll be spending it on silly things like this is if you become a rapper."
vikramjatt11,"I did this. Everything was done online.

I went to their website, opened my HSA, and filled out the information to do a rollover. They then let me download a prefilled PDF form that I printed off, signed, and mailed in to them about a week ago.

Received an email Monday that they sent the request to my HSA provider and will have my funds soon."
vikramjatt11,"I am not sure where you would put it all but am interested in the answer.

But the $250k limit is per bank so having multiple accounts at one bank will not help you in that regard.

You would not want to keep more than $500k cash on-hand at that point anyway so you would basically be putting the money into different investments."
sanjsrik,"Neither of your statements are true. Some of us live in very nice apartments without squalor or roommates and don't commute 90 minutes to work and make a very good living. We are just smart enough to know that spending stupid amounts of money on rentals is worth nothing. Stupidity doesn't come with a price tag. Sometimes, the more money you have, the easier it is to bilk you out of money for nothing more than what others think of your perceived image of themselves. Sad. "
sanjsrik,"I'm stating that with a very good credit score, Amex still increased my interest rate. Exactly where is it bad advice? In some places, vendors don't even take amex because they charge such high fees to vendors.

There are plenty of other choices for credit cards. Amex shouldn't be one of them."
sanjsrik,"My credit score was 768. Then I noticed that after I charged something, my interest rate went up to ~16 or 17%.i paid the balance and when I asked Amex why my interest rate went up when my credit score actually went up, they had a very non-answer to give me. A lot of ""this is our policy"" kind of bullshit.

I never use the card in general. This was just an impetus to cancel it once and for all. In general, it's the highest interest rate card I have."
sanjsrik,"Agree with this. Unless there is ABSOLUTE NEED for a new car, pay off the debt first. By the time you do, your credit score should have corrected itself. I'm assuming the bankruptcy has already fallen off if it was 9 years ago. The only thing lowering your credit score (from your explanation) sounds to be your debt ratio which I assume is over 30%. Get that down and I bet your credit score will go up again. Mine just jumped almost 30 points because for whatever reason, my credit card company on the only card I have any debt on and am actively (and aggressively) paying it off just upped my credit limit therefore lowering my credit ratio which raised my credit score because now I was under 30%.

&amp;#x200B;

Use a new car as a reward. Plus, then you'll only have that to pay off not the car AND the credit card.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, wouldn't it feel better to sign for a car on your own rather than with a cosigner?"
sanjsrik,"If you had this information, why didn't you post it in your original post?

Fire your shitty accountant and make her pay for the effort of getting the money back. If she did your taxes and you were audited, she'd be required to come with you. You paid the penalty on faulty tax advice. She should be doing all this for you to get your money back. And, paying for the time. "
sanjsrik,"I make a lot more than that I think because I live in NYC and salaries are much higher here because of the cost of living and such. I was charged for using turbotax because net is still above the limit for free. it wasn't bad, it was actually still cheaper than my accountant charges and they took out of the refund which amazingly this time was 4x what I had last year. I guess I qualified this time for the new tax cuts."
sanjsrik,"Lol, I'm so glad THOUSANDS didn't think of that to be told the bank had no idea what they were talking about because the local office that created the millions of fake accounts was circling the wagons and lied outright about their culpability.

I asked a simple rational question. I got an emotional entitled answer. Banks continue to get away with this again and again because consumers just don't understand that banking is where the house always wins. "
sanjsrik,"Did you get anything in writing from them before going in? When you left did you get anything from them about follow-on work? They own the work, but if they want you to do more, that's on them on how they want to compensate you. You are no longer their intern. They should pay you if you finished with them. What they're trying to do is take advantage of you and hoping you won't call them on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

IF you already did the work and gave them what they wanted, you really have no leg to stand on because they got what they wanted and you got nothing in writing. Asking them after the fact is really a non-starter as they owe you nothing because they agreed to pay you nothing. Anything they would pay you would be out of common decency. Which, i doubt they may have. 

Obligation does not equal pay. You are only obligated if they pay you."
sanjsrik,"Would  you pay a balance transfer fee for the balance transfer of paying off the one card with the other? Is there an upside to paying one credit card off with another or are you simply compounding your debt by adding more debt? 

Is it a balance transfer with 0% interest for a set amount of time if not, you're just taking on more debt at some interest rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first advice I always hear when trying to pay off credit card debt is don't make more debt. Are you making more debt while still trying to pay off the debt you already have? If you are making more debt, is there a way to stop making more debt and just living within your means? Even better, can you live below your means? What can you cut in your life or pare back on to have more money to throw at the credit card? You need to stop making more debt if you are making more of it because this endless cycle will not end."
sanjsrik,"1. You should follow up with them, but you could do one of two things. Have them hold it against any future payments you may owe next year or ask for it back.
2. Fire your shitty accountant who can't seem to do taxes.

&amp;#x200B;"
sanjsrik,"A short term plan to stop contributing and paying more to the bill makes more sense. Stopping contributions for a year or two won't impact your long term savings but it will impact how much interest and payoff time of your loan.

Being debt free should be the focus. Once your debt free you can contribute the maximum amount to your retirement savings. Another thi g you might want to think about doing is taking a loan against the 401k. The money you'd be payi g back is money to yourself. You use that to further reduce your student loan debt.

Just a thought. You've got decades yet to retirement. The longer you take you pay off your loan the more you're at the risk of something coming along out of left field that could derail this plan.

Being out of debt should be your primary goal. "
sanjsrik,"Why does your story keep changing?

First, your accountant filed your taxes and said the bill was $1700 which you paid. 

Then, she told you after you paid the money to the IRS, that it was in fact a $200 refund. 

Now, she may not have filed your taxes at all and you can possibly stop her from filing.

Something tells me that you two deserve each other.

Nothing in your story makes sense. "
sanjsrik,"You realize that you're making a non - issue of something that wasn't mentioned. Someone mentioned Amex, I was talking about my experience with them in terms of interest rate. Anyone who DOES carry a balance will pay this exorbitant interest rate. That's my onky point no o e cares if you pay it off. That wasn't the point of my advice."
sanjsrik,"if you have a pin, why are you calling them? the unfreeze site for each lets you use the pin.

I just ednt online and found all three credit bureau's sites that let you enter the pin numbers to temporarily unlock your freeze. not sure what you're talking about. "
sanjsrik,"You realize that long after people thought that they were no longer responsible for their mortgage that they found out years later that Wells Fargo had never released the original mortgage holders and had in some cases started foreclosure proceedings on them?

"
sanjsrik,"There's calculators out there, I was using one ([https://www.creditcards.com/calculators/balance-transfer/](https://www.creditcards.com/calculators/balance-transfer/)) was one I was using. Sometimes, depending on the interest rate, you may pay just as much in transfer fees.

I know this may ""seem"" obvious, but have you called them and been extremely nice and asked them to lower your interest rate? Sometimes that works. Sometimes it doesn't."
Catchthedisc,"My Life $$ Strategy for 2019 - What do you think? I am a bit new here, but love the stories and support of this sub!

Here is my situation. I need to make a few smart moves in the coming years. I am a bit stuck on the best choices.

I am 50. No children or dependents. No debts whatsoever. Healthy (knock wood). Excellent credit.
Current salary is $58K. I can save a about $1,500 a month, $18,000 per annum. Living expenses roughly$22K.
Assets: 1.) Cash on hand, $65K  2.) $20k in a sweep account.  3.) $10K divided among 3 ETFs brokered by a ""too big to fail"" bank -- all growth stocks.  4.) $12K in an orphaned retirement account all growth stocks cannot contribute to 5.) Socially responsible IRA all stocks $36K  6.) orphaned retirement account TIAA 70/30 stocks/bonds $38K. 7.)  Vanguard IRA Roth $4,500 70/30 stocks bonds 8.) $5,800 current retirement account Franklin Temp that work contributes max to.  All in all, it's 95,000 in retirement accounts, roughly 85% stocks, which feels too risky for much longer.  Another $10K in a taxed account.  And some cash to use for something.

My plan for 2019: 1. contribute $7,000 to the Vanguard IRA, and each year thereafter. It has 70/30 allocation which feels good at this stage. 2. Re-allocate the retirement accounts to include bonds. 3. invest $20K in a taxed balanced mfund, like Vanguard.  4. Better income job. 5. consider moving to a cheap country.  My main concern is that i need more return on investments but i really cannot take the risk.  Also, I have no house, so buying a house is an option. Would hate to be homeless when i am 70! 

Finally my crew of friends say, buy silver and dig a hole in the ground -- it is safer than our flimsy financial system.

So...what would you do?  Any feedback would be awesome.
Peace.

Catchthedisc,"I do not have that particular issue, but one cool thing is my jobs have had mandatory retirement accounts.

savannahjosh1233,"I understand where you are coming from. 

A lot can definitely change, but I'm very confident I won't be there for 2 years. 

That said, would you suggest that I increase my biweekly contributions more than 4 percent (again not focused on the match) just in order to have it in a non-taxable account? 

And if I did that -- it would be your advice to live off the lump sum savings I currently have based on the chart? 

Thank you!"
savannahjosh1233,"With a lease, you need to consider that you are going to pay a down payment (anywhere from 2k-4k) plus owe a monthly car note. And then car insurance. 

Financially, it wouldn't make sense considering your pending move. 

You could spend $2-3k on a beater that will get you to point A and B. 

But then I would think, okay I'm about to spend 3k on a car for about 1 year. Comes to about $250 per month. Which is more than you are currently spending according to what you mentioned. And again, add in car insurance. That will increase what you are currently spending. 

I think you are most bothered (from my perspective) from the convenience issue. If it were me -- I would just tough it out as presumably you won't need a car once you move. 

Figure out what 6 months of emergency fund is approximately and throw some of that free cash towards your student debt."
savannahjosh1233,"Satisfied Social Security Tax, Yet Still Being Deducted Hey PF, 

In March, I received a large bonus which satisfied my social security tax for the year. 

The company I work for sold -- and we transitioned onto their payroll. But I am still with same payroll company ADP. 

I received my first paycheck with new company and noticed SS was deducted. I called the payroll office and they told me that because they are a ""different entity"" that SS will still get taken out of my check. 

Is this accurate? "
savannahjosh1233,"For me — and solely for me — but the minute I get married - our finances meld together. 

That $100 Verizon bill in collections of his (just an example) - its now “mine”. Doesn’t mean I have to pay it. But it does mean I have to communicate the importance of financial literacy — AND help out when I can. 

Partnerships, marriage, however you want to label it — it’s about coming together for common goals. For me, I’ve always made it very clear my goals in relation to finance. You work through these things by communicating. 

And again, huge disclaimer THIS IS SOLELY MY OPINION. I know many people on PF will definitely disagree. 

"
savannahjosh1233,"No problem! I just recently paid off my car 36 months early -- and I just loveeeeee not having a car note. 

Insurance is still a killer for me ($165 per month). But a couple of ""at-fault"" accidents will raise premiums :)"
savannahjosh1233,"That's very possible. When I did a quick search in my area for leases -- I used that information to write my response. 

I of course have heard of 0 down leases. Either way, OP will end up paying more than he currently does using ubers."
savannahjosh1233,"Fair enough! I appreciate your insight on this. It has been helpful. 

I think I have been anxious about where I stand financially. And although I have gotten myself out of 20K in CC and Medical Bill debt over the past two years -- I worry I'm behind on saving for retirement. "
savannahjosh1233,"1. That's both of our cell phone bill. 
2. I have had two accidents (my fault) that State Farm has paid out. I stick with state farm (even because of the price) due to the fact that they always give me a great vehicle price for my car. 
3. I am at 4 percent right now, I can increase to 5 next quarter. 
5. I have personal IRA, currently with 16K in it. 


My SO and I have been together for 4 years. I plan on marrying this person. I'm not paying the full way. I am allowing him to focus on his first semester without worries of a job. He has already received an offer and accepted a research position beginning in June. I had the ability to do this and *wanted* to do it. Med school, 1200 miles away, no friends -- I wanted him to focus on school his first semester. "
savannahjosh1233,"Great information. Yeah, I'm hoping it will change. I took a pretty decent pay cut after the merger -- and I was definitely banking on that extra SS money for my budget. Not a terribly huge amount but every penny counts. "
savannahjosh1233,"I currently have 50K left over from a lump sum bonus. That's what I was referring to when I said ""living off savings"" in exchange for increasing my 401K contribution dramatically. 

The company I work for has sold. I was actually given a pay decrease when the new owners took over. 

My SO currently lives 1200 miles away, I have every intention to move to that area. "
savannahjosh1233,"I can relate with helping the boyfriend and eventual husband during PhD (I just started doing this :P)

I can only speak to my experience. The eating out/going out is a lot of money. What I personally would do is increase your emergency fund to 6 month of expenses. 

After that, if you gave yourself just one night a month to go out on the town lets say ($100) -- combined with the $800 free cash, you have $1,150 per month to tackle debt, or $13,800 a year. 

But I'm not entirely I have the full picture. 103K salary, let's say take home was 72k? My rough calculation has you with $2K+ a month after the expenses you listed? 

At least for me -- I started tracking all of my spending and when I figured that out -- the picture became much clearer.  So I think if you really focused on an accurate budget, you would be surprised what you can do! 

Long story short, for me -- increase e-fund, erase all the debt, then start tackling retirement. "
savannahjosh1233,"Does your husband mirror your thoughts? You seemed as though you're not jumping at the idea. 

I would stick to where you are. If you are planning on buying a house -- do you have funds saved up for down payment? 

"
savannahjosh1233,"At least on our deal, the new company wasn’t just buying the brick and mortar — they were buying the people. 

Unfortunately our boss paid from his heart (definitely those who worked hard got rewarded) — the new people seem fantastic but just have more of a structure to their compensation. "
savannahjosh1233,"100 percent of the first 1 percent, 50 percent up to the next 4 percent. 

I'm not focusing too much on the match as of right now because I won't be with the company long enough to be vested. 

Hope this information helps and thank you!"
savannahjosh1233,"If you are in a position to do it, which it sounds like you are, I would absolutely help your parents with it. 

The 70k salary coming out of college was in large part (I'm sure) to do with the education and degree your parents helped finance. "
Not_a_CPA,"I'm still confused -- are you earning this money and saving it or are you taking out loans and saving the loan proceeds?

If it's the former, why not just pay your tuition as you go instead of incurring loan origination fees, interest, and risk?

If it's the latter, that's a really bad idea. "
Not_a_CPA,"Your employer is required to provide you with a W2. Follow [these steps](https://www.fool.com/taxes/2014/03/15/didnt-get-your-w2-heres-what-to-do-now.aspx) if you still haven't received it. 

Your bank should send you a 1099-INT if they paid your more than $10 in interest during the year. If they have not, contact your bank. "
Not_a_CPA,"Disagree. 

Had OP stayed with their company, then there would be no issue since the company was paying for their class. However, because OP was required to reimburse the cost of the class, the expense shifted to OP -- it doesn't matter if OP paid for the class directly up front or reimbursed the employer on the back end -- OP still incurred the cost. "
Not_a_CPA,"Just FYI, they're probably going to come back with some standardized BS language about how they can't confirm that but that their SOP is to do so. At some point you'll have to just take what they give you because some agencies will simply refuse to make that promise. And really, they don't *have* to."
Not_a_CPA,"You have to legally be an adult to enter into a contract in most jurisdictions.

Simply put, when you take out an auto loan, the loan is paid back over time, usually in equal payments or ""installments"". Commonly, auto loans are paid over a period of 60 months, but not always. Small amounts can be paid over a shorter time period and sometimes new car purchases can go up to 84 months. 

The amount of the monthly payment will depend on the interest rate and the length of the loan. The higher the interest rate and the shorter the loan period, the higher the payment. A lower interest rate and a longer period will lower the payment **BUT** if the period is longer you will end up paying more in interest than you would for a shorter period. 

"
Not_a_CPA,"I don't know that anyone here will be able to give you an answer because, to me, this really seems like a personal decision. I think you're identified your options and understand the effects and opportunity costs of each one -- it's up to you to decide which one to do. 

Yeah, if you move it'll take longer to pay off the loans and yeah, if you wait two years, you may have to postpone having another child and moving to a new house. 

"
Not_a_CPA,"The bottom line is that you shouldn't be dispensing inaccurate advice or suggesting someone is trying to commit fraud without reason. Additionally, and while wholly unnecessary given the clarity of their original post, as OP has now explained to you they are asking how to ensure their employer is reporting accurately. "
mega512,"Maybe she should have picked up one of those phone calls.  When I was buying a house my debt to income ratio wasn't great.  My dog needed surgery which pushed me over what they wanted.  Day of closing, I had to wait to see what would happen but luckily it all worked out.  So, with that said, they will pull your credit once more and they will check your debt and scores.  "
tdpdcpa,"Can you sell the stock at any time without penalty or is there a lockup period that disallows you from selling for a certain period of time?

If the former - it's free money. I would put it after the 401(k) match, personally, but that's up to you and your risk tolerance.

If it's the latter - I would avoid. We just saw PG&amp;E drop 55% today. Extreme circumstance, of course, but you could be caught holding that bag. "
tdpdcpa,"401k contributions lower one's AGI. When you file jointly, all of your incomes are included together at the top of your form 1040. It doesn't matter who made what, it all gets put into the same bucket. 

Married filing separately is the IRS equivalent of saying ""I'm married, but I kind of want to be taxed as a single taxpayer"" (there are some extra rules, but that's the gist). Each taxpayer will be evaluated on the income that they earn individually. Tax rates are progressive and marginal; so the more you make, the more each additional dollar is taxed.

Assume OP earns more than their spouse. OP would stand to benefit more than proportionally in an MFS scenario if they increase their 401k contribution as opposed to their spouse, because they're in a higher tax bracket.

There are other implications to consider as well. Say OP's spouse is on an Income-Based Repayment Plan for Student Loans. If they file Jointly, they'll consider OP's income as well as OP's spouse, but if they file separately, they'll consider just OP's spouse. OP's spouse can decrease their Student Loan payment by decreasing their AGI, which can be accomplished through 401k contributions."
tdpdcpa,"&gt; Thoughts on asset allocation or any other avenues for diversifying my investments?  

Your blue chip portfolio is all stocks and all fairly concentrated in a couple of sectors, but you're probably aware of that and if that wasn't your intention, you wouldn't have purchased them anyway. 

I'm interested in your decision to allocate a portion of your 401k to Roth as opposed to going all Traditional and then trying to use a backdoor Roth for additional, tax-free growth. Reason being you only have so many opportunities to reduce your tax bill in the present that you're kind of leaving it sit there and if you're already investing in the stock market (probably through retirement and beyond) you can enjoy tax-free growth on investments that you would make anyway. As you said, you're heavy in cash as it is. 

&gt; My savings account is currently paying 2.0% interest and my auto loan is 1.49%. Is it correct that interest income is taxable, but auto interest expense is not tax deductible?  

That's correct.

&gt; So if rates stay the same then 2.0% savings is roughly a wash with 1.49% auto interest, right? But if I think rates will continue to rise, then I shouldn’t pay down the loan early? 

That line of thinking is also correct. It is against your best interests to pay down your auto debt. 

&gt; General saving target for someone with my income? 

I think the real answer to that question is whatever helps finance the lifestyle that you're looking to live. The answer varies substantially depending on whether you want to buy a yacht and party it up Wolf of Wall Street style versus retire early and live in a van. 

As you said, you're good at financial modelling. Figure out your goals, capital outlays required to achieve those goals, and build a budget that provides for enough savings to accomplish that. "
tdpdcpa,"&gt; Under what circumstances or for what items would you justify purchasing something on your credit card that you can't pay off in the same month? 

I'm fortunate enough to never have encountered a situation where I couldn't pay something off in the same month and doing so would be unconscionable to me. As others have mentioned, only in emergency situations and even then, it must be something unforeseen (lost job, medical bill, etc.).

&amp;#x200B;"
tdpdcpa,"This is helpful. How much do you currently spend in a given month? This will generally determine how much you need to have saved in order to retire; which will determine how much you'll need to save annually.

&gt;Need advice on money managers. I don’t want to be ripped off with commissions but I do want someone to lead me in the right direction on investments. 

At $250K, you probably don't have enough to warrant finding a money manager. You're best off doing it yourself. If you want the easiest method, whoever you have your retirement accounts through should offer a 2040 Target Date Fund (""TDF"") that will invest your money with a risk profile that's generally commensurate with someone with your time horizon to retirement. "
tdpdcpa,"Someone asked a similar question in another thread that should answer your primary question. [Here's the information I provided them](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/akzoo2/stop_blaming_your_spouse_or_your_second_job_for/efcuiwn). 

As for your unimportant question, the IRS seems to think that everyone reads the tiny details of their instructions and that their forms are straight-forward. In the fine print, it does say that ""only one person should fill out one for Married Filing Jointly"", but of course, in practice, maybe 1 in 20 people actually read the instructions. "
tdpdcpa,"&gt;Approx $4000 in expenses, but plan on having my house paid off by then. 

For sake of simplicity, we'll assume that you'll continue to use $4,000 per month in retirement. Even though you won't have housing expenses, you'll likely to see an increase in medical expenses (premiums, co-pays, prescription medicine, etc.) which will more than offset this cost. This will also assume that you're planning on maintaining your current lifestyle in retirement. 

Bearing this in mind, and assuming a 4% withdrawal rate, you would need to have $1.2 million saved for retirement by Age 60 in order to achieve that level of retirement. Assuming a 5% rate of return on your portfolio, you would need to save $16,230 per year in addition to your current balance in order to get to $1.2 million by the time you reach age 60. 

Of course, this number comes with a number of caveats including, but not limited to:

1. A 5% rate of return on assets, while historically consistent, is not necessarily indicative of future returns. Asset values are generally higher than they've been over the course of history which may reduce future returns. This would necessitate additional saving.
2. A 4% withdrawal rate may not last for your entire retirement. This may necessitate additional assets at retirement, which would be achieved by additional saving. 
3. This does not consider the effect of Social Security, which may reduce the extent that retirement savings that you would need, assuming that you qualify, and it still exists.
4. This does not consider the houses that you expect to inherit and any income or funds from sale in the calculation. The timing, amount, and existence of this amount is questionable and generally out of your control, so it's best ignored for purposes of the analysis.
5. This analysis does not consider taxes. Based on the characterization of the $250K that you currently have saved, and future actions of Congress, which cannot be predicted, your taxes may be higher or lower in retirement than they are now, which would necessitate more or less saving, respectively. Additionally, if a substantial portion of your $250K is in Traditional Accounts, your lack of tax diversity may preclude you from realizing significant tax savings in retirement. This would necessitate additional saving. 
6. This doesn't consider the incremental needs that you will have as you progress through life (kids going to college, etc.). This may impact your ability to save for retirement.

Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts here. The $16,230 per year I noted above is not a hard and fast number - it could be a lot more than that, it could even be less than that. The biggest takeaway is that you need to save, and I would recommend that amount to be your baseline. You know your situation better than we do, so leverage retirement calculators on the internet, which could be helpful in giving you an idea of how much and to what extent you need to save. 

Information on tax-advantaged vehicles that you can use for saving (401k, IRA, HSA, etc.) can be found in the sidebar. It is generally recommended that you leverage them as much as possible. 

Hope this helps!"
tdpdcpa,"&gt; I saw on another sub people talking about all the money they had saved up by the time they were 30 and their retirement plans, and I panicked. 

Don't worry about where other people are and what they have; they're not running the same race that you are. You have your own goals and dreams that might require something completely different from what they want.

A lot of what you're concerned about will be addressed directly in this [handy flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png). This will tell you how to best direct your assets in order to maximize your wealth."
tdpdcpa,"To be certain, are you referring to income taxes that you owe related to unemployment benefits that you received? If that's the case, you would include it on Line 19 of your Schedule 1 and include it in your Form 1040 on Line 6. It would be tax effected and deducted from your refund that way. "
tdpdcpa,"This would be true if they were only looking for the tax-free growth benefit of a Roth, but they're likely looking for more investment flexibility. 

A Roth 401(k) puts your completely at the mercy of whatever funds allowed by your provider; potentially with significant fees. Roth IRAs allow you to invest in whichever funds you choose, including low- and no-fee options.

Roth IRAs also allow for certain other advantages that aren't available with a Roth 401(k), including:

* No Required Minimum Distributions in Retirement
* Early withdrawal of $10,000 of earnings toward the purchase of your first home"
tdpdcpa,"&gt; I currently have a credit score of 800 and have never had many problems with finances. 

Are you able to make loan payments on a credit card? With that credit score, you may be able to qualify for a 12- or 18-month interest free credit card with enough of a credit limit to put the balance of the loan on it. That will at least give you enough time to get back on your feet. "
tdpdcpa,"\&gt; I'm not able to max it out unfortunately (I don't have the income)

When you say this, are you saying that you don't have the earned income to qualify for funding the Roth IRA or are you saying that you won't have the income to recoup what you contribute?"
tdpdcpa,"I think you're looking for r/investing. 

Personal finance focuses primarily on the goals of what one wants in life and assesses the different tools toward achieving those goals. The tools involved in those goals generally don't advise individual investments as they carry a specific amount of risk. 

That doesn't mean that you shouldn't invest your money in individual stocks; that's like saying you should never spend your money. You just won't find opinions on equity analysis here because it's generally not a recommended tool to achieve goals in life. "
tdpdcpa,"&gt; So I can afford $100-$200 a month in my Roth IRA. It won't hurt me financially. 

I think you just answered your question. You're precisely the person who should be contributing to a Roth IRA since you're a college student who lives at home. You will never have a greater opportunity to save money than right now and you will never have a lower tax rate than right now.

Don't worry about maxing it out, just contribute what you can. Every little bit helps and you'll thank yourself later. "
tdpdcpa,"&gt;people need to stop making this place into frugal/leanfire 2.0

I think that this piece of the comment is misguided. Yes, a lot of the advice this sub puts out here could be construed as ""frugal"", but this isn't one of those circumstances. 

OP mentioned that they're graduating college in a month, which could potentially mean:

1. Purchasing professional attire to interview for jobs
2. Purchasing a professional wardrobe for said job
3. Purchasing a new vehicle to commute to said job
4. Paying multiple months worth of rent for an apartment or other living situation
5. Beginning payment on student loans, potentially without a job

This doesn't even consider the possibility of an emergency. We have no information on any of this, nor how much this job would actually pay or OP's lifestyle, but we do know that they have $2,100 in a HYSA; which wouldn't be enough to cover half of the items on the above list. $800 isn't such a significant windfall that it eradicates the situation either, so the best course of action is to throw it in an EF. "
tdpdcpa,"&gt;Question is, do I max my 401k (increase my contribution to 22%), and my wife stays at 7%, or is it better to bump her up to 15% to be in line with mine, and I don’t make any changes to my plan.

Each individual is allowed to contribute up to $19,000 to their respective 401(k) plan (with an extra $6,000 if you're 50 or older). As long as you file jointly, there wouldn't be any difference in how you split it, percentage-wise."
tdpdcpa,"&gt; If I can't withdraw from my Roth IRA until I'm 60, is it really a good decision for FIRE? 

Contributions to a Roth IRA can be withdrawn at any time without penalty (but they can't be subsequently restored). Additionally, you are allowed to make [Substantially Equal Periodic Payments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substantially_equal_periodic_payments) under IRC Section 72(t) which allows you to withdraw from your retirement account prior to reaching age 59.5.

&gt; Maybe its worth contributing until I have $10,000 to withdraw for a first home? I also read that is a qualified withdrawal. 

The exception that you're noting allows you to take $10,000 in earnings from your Roth IRA to purchase a first home. This is different from just the balance of the account.

For example, if you make $50,000 in contributions and have a balance of $70,000 in your Roth IRA, you'd be able to take out $50,000 at any time, without penalty, or $60,000 toward the purchase of your first home. 

&gt; We will be getting a 401k program in 2019 and I'm wondering if I should shift all my contributions there. 

I wouldn't shift all of your contributions to a 401(k) as these plans have less flexibility and offer fewer (and worse) fund options than Roth IRA's. With that said, any match that you get on your 401(k) plan is free money and it's good to maintain tax diversity in your retirement portfolio for when the time comes. "
tdpdcpa,"&gt; when I file taxes online, does it automatically file the state taxes to the state where I have worked, or do I have to file separately and fill out different forms for each state? 

Usually, it's the latter. I've never dealt with a tax software that's able to calculate that on my behalf, and I've had two state filing requirements for three of the last four years.

&gt; And do I have to /should I file a return for NYC since I didn't make that much money?

For New York City, [the rules](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/finance/taxes/personal-income-tax-and-non-resident-employees.page) seem to indicate that you are required to file. 

For New York State, [the rules](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pit/file/nonresidents.htm) state that you have a filing requirement if you're a nonresident and you have New York-based income in excess of the Standard Deduction ($8,000 for individuals). Therefore, you don't have a filing requirement. 

However, you likely paid taxes to New York State through withholding and would need to file a return to receive a refund on these taxes. It also appears as though information from the New York State return is used as part of the New York City 1127 return, so you may need to complete it either way. Just to be safe, I would still file a New York State return if I were you."
tdpdcpa,"&gt;Any suggestions and advice you can give me?

You haven't given us a lot to go off of here.

1. What do you want your retirement to be? Do you plan on retiring at 50, 70, somewhere in between, next week, or never?
2. How much money do you have saved for retirement?

The answers to these two questions specifically will help us provide you with some sort of guidance.

&gt;I think I want rollover previous employer 401k to IRA so I can have more investment opportunities.

This is generally a good idea.

&gt;I plan on starting Roth this year and maxing it out. Hopefully do the same each year following.

This is also, generally, a good idea. Obviously it's a situation where you need to consider your circumstances, as a Traditional IRA may be more appropriate for you, but that's better addressed in the [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/rothortraditional)."
tdpdcpa,"&gt;$100 a week into trad vs $100 a week into Roth is actually like $120 considering tax bracket. Then at retirement, the entire Roth amount is yours, no taxes owed

I disagree; some element of tax diversity is probably the best approach. Exclusively using a Roth may require you to pay more taxes than having a diverse mix of contributions between Roth and Traditional due to our progressive tax system. "
tdpdcpa,"&gt;I could do far easier as I got older as well as would get me some extremely marketable skills. 

This should play far more into the equation than the pension, in my opinion. The income gains from switching jobs and better quality of life would push me to switch if I were in your shoes."
tdpdcpa,"&gt;They cannot force you to pay it back, so don't.

This may not be true. Many offers of employment stipulate that sign-on bonuses are required to be repaid to the Company if you leave voluntarily or are terminated within a certain amount of time."
tdpdcpa,"OP is probably referring to Credit Cards which have 0% interest introductory periods. [NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/credit-cards/low-interest) has a list of some of their favorites. 

However, it's important to note that this will treat the symptom and not the cause. The couple of big money items that you have to pay underscores the importance of having an emergency fund. Check out the [flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png) to get a sense of how best to allocate your money. It's also important to sit down and look at your income and expenses, build a budget that works for you, and stick with it.

Hope this helps!"
darament,"A $16 increase is not exactly much but thats my view. You can look into third party insurance brokers that deals with multiple companies. Don’t go direct to the insurance company. Insurance brokers don’t actually cost you anything and can do all the searching for you to find a decent enough price. If they don’t find a better price just stay with geico. My experience with geico was not good and they weren’t the cheapest for me. 

Brokers work on commisions that are paid out by the premium. If you go to a direct agent the commission is still there its just what agent gets paid it. And direct agents get a smaller cut compared to non direct. It shouldn’t actually cost you anything for estimates provided by a indipendent insurance broker"
darament,Banks like to see multiple accounts kept in good standing if your trying to buy a house/condo. Some require you have 2-3 or more accounts in good standing. Even if one is a low limit account it can look better because your managing multiple accounts. 
darament,"Theres no good way to go about it because its all negotiating and different people will be willing to accept one thing and others will not. 

Look at the local codes. The $30,000 mark seems high considering its a repair. If its just a repair and the septic was already approved then the local inspector might not require new permits or engineering. 

Every city will be different so while you may get a bunch of “correct” answers by other people ultimately it will depend on the authority having jurisdiction(local building inspector).  Don’t just trust what the guy trying to sell you something says. "
darament,"Unless you have enough cash on hand to pay the difference in the loan don’t assume you can just trade the car in. Auto loans are backed by the car so if you owe $30,000 on the car still but will only get $15,000-20,000 back on it the banks might not allow you to add that extra to the new loan. 

I bought a car i didn’t like and ended up keeping it because i was so upside down on it and selling it wasn’t going to benefit me. I ended up eating the costs and just letting my dad drive it. I had another car already and kept driving it. I thought about trading it in or selling it once i wasn’t upside down on it but just ended up keeping it and never using it. "
darament,When talking shared living spaces too it doesn’t seem like it would be the same either. Maybe if each room had its own bathroom and kitchen but when your sharing stuff it doesn’t equate to the same rent as if everything was for yourself. 
darament,"Depends on your situation. More credit is better overall. very short term raising the credit limit is going to be better because adding a new account will lower your average age of credit. 

Long term a second card would probably be better since it will eventual get older than your current average age of credit. Then any future new accounts would have a smaller impact on the average age of credit. "
darament,"Cant really help you with things on getting your money back Because its pretty much too late to do anything about it now. Not paying was probably the worst thing you could have had done because your willingly breaking the terms of the contract. And not paying cancels your insurance as well. You may need to start looking into their insurance terms of service and fine comb through there to figure out what the process was to get the repair done. With every insurance there is a process and they may make it as hard as possible so having a paper trail and doing what the insurance documents say to do is very important.

darament,"Just going to go through this by line item about how bad or risky these are. Not going to give exact numbers for cost since i dont know but from my experience heres my guage on what i think it would cost to repair. Assuming you can do some basic repairs

$-under 100
$$ under 1000
$$$ over 1000
$$$$over 3000


1: medium. If its above the screed theres a potential for it to drain into the house. Best course of action would be to remove it and then dig down so you have a patio at the correct height $$$

2: low its a quick fix that may just require replacing the washers and can be done pretty simply with basic hand tools $

3: low medium . They may be controlled by the broken gfi and start getting power once that outlet is replaced $

4: low. replacing isn’t a big deal. They go bad and getting a new weather resistant gfi is $20 from the box store. If done yourself its a simple replace one for one. $

5: high. Termites or carpenter ants/bees can be very destructive and the damage could be more extensive than just visible surface damage $$$

6: medium. It could be from a leak in the roof or from something else. It may have been an old stain that the source of it was fixed and its better now. Or it could be a new thing that meeds to be fixed. $$

7: medium. Windows go bad over time and need to be replaced. They aren’t actually leaking which is good but the temperature changes is allowing moisture to be trapped. The bad windows should be replaced but probably not a very high priority $$

8: medium. The insert may have to be serviced repaired  or replaced. That can be from a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars for a new one $$$

9: medium. Same thing as line 8 $$$

10: low. Its probably seized up or bound and needs to be replaced. While replacing fixing any leaks should occur at that time $$

11: not sure. They didn’t climb up there which is odd usually an inspector has a few ladders and can get up to the level of the roof to get a better look. This just seems like apathy or laziness towards it to me. If its a bad roof then $$$$

12: low. Fascia is trim board. It can usually easily be replaced with a hammer nails and some caulk. Then a coat of paint. $

13: low. Its not the house so unless you have dogs its an item that can be put off until later$$$

14: high. Water leaks from supply pipes can cause lots of extra damage. $$$

15: low. The meter isn’t required to have one newer codes require them but if the gas line was installed or house was built before the requirement then its a grandfathered in installation. you could pay to have one installed for peace of mind later on though$$

16: medium-high. Its a fairly big ticket item to replace. $$$

17: low medium. If its a leak or leaks then it potentially really bad. If its just pet urine then still bad but not something to worry about anymore. May have to replace any carpet or under-flooring potentially and maybe the trim boards as well if they are mdf. $$

18: medium. Its a high priority item to seal that up. Its recommended to caulk bathrooms every few years because the stuff does go bad. If theres more damage because of it leaking is unknown. Caulking should prevent any future damage though. $

19: low. not really a deficiency towards the house but could be something to replace. $$"
darament,"The issue would come if your choice was to spend say 500-1000 on a head gasket or 2000 on a car you risk getting a car that works for a few months and then has an issue. 

When i buy cars i try to look at service schedules and see if it’s close to a major service because i can do them myself but if they were done by a shop it would be a few thousand dollars for a timing job and everything else but only 300 to do it myself. 

A lot of people choose to not pay that amount and just get a new car when the one they have is still in decent working order. Its also a way to negotiate down against a private seller or dealer that doesn’t have a shop. 

The point of that is a lot of people sell cars that need a major service in a few months and you may buy a car that you still have to put a lot of money into just to keep it running smoothly. If they say they did the work and are trying to get rid of it then i would be concerned about some issue they know about but are choosing to not disclose."
darament,"Well the place was yours from the day of signing right. Did they give you the keys that day?

If they had a stipulation that you couldn’t move in the day you signed the lease then they should be charging you from the day they first allowed you to move in."
darament,"Your debt might no longer be reported but it doesn’t change that you owe money. Your state may have other laws that will allow them to still file a suit for collection. 

I would pay the debt and it will show as paid. After that your credit can really start being rebuilt. 

You potentially can still have a judgement against you that requires you to pay the debt plus interest. If your not at that point you can potentially work with them. "
darament,Theres no guarantee you can roll the old loan into the new one. It depends on what your credit union allows for a LTV percentage. If your credit isn’t great they might not allow a higher percentage rate. You can usually get all that information from your bank though and knowing what the value of the car you plan on buying what size down payment you would need in order to be able to do what your wanting. 
darament,"Op pretty much stated that he’s not an actual employee. He’s essentially no different than a dog walker getting paid by a family every time he walks the dog. He’s getting a flat $15 to do a session. No taxes being withheld or anything.

His summer job is over and no longer actually employed. "
darament,"Are you getting an actual check and having withholdings taken out,did you fill out a w2 or are you getting cash or a personal check

So minimum wage depends on the business. If its a larger company it raises to $15/hr much quicker. 

Some states have different rates for under age people as well. You need to look at your classification as well and you will find more information about what rates your allowed to be paid.

darament,I would wear a polo type shirt and keep it clean if your working before and after the interview. Its for the same company so your not necessarily trying to impress them with how good you look but more your knowledge and skills you would be bringing to the table to the you would be moving to. 
darament,It may be guaranteed like he’s sayin but the bank doesn’t give a crap about that. They don’t lend on a future income. They only lend on past incomes. So if he gets that money good for him. Its not going to affect that they will only lend him whatever they determine anyways. Hopefully he doesn’t have any other loans or credit card debt because that will only lower the amount that he will qualify for anyways. But as long as he can live fine then any extra money should just go into the bank towards retirement or something instead of increasing cost of lifestyle.
darament,Yeah selling would be the short game. Even if the housing market crashes rent still stays the same. People who can no longer afford to own a house are the ones who get hit hardest and they still rent. Housing prices go down but rental prices tend to stay the same. 
darament,"$50 doesn’t seem bad might and might be low compared to market rates.

Ive had rent $150 increases on a $1200 place. So over a 10% increase. That really sucked. 

Landlords choosing round numbers just makes their life a little easier. "
darament,"You have to ask the bank if they can exit because thats going to be dependent on your loan contract. 
The only downsides are if you end up not being able to pay or if your parents start getting all weird on you. If they are cool with it and aren’t going to be all in your face then theres not really a downside for you. "
darament,If other things mentioned don’t work you could post on twitter about your experience as well. A lot of companies don’t like that negative pr. A lot of times they will “look into what went wrong” so that they can save face. 
darament,"I would set it up so he can pull maybe around $3000/month if he’s in some form of higher learning until 22.  Half that amount if he doesn’t go to school at all if he doesn’t pursue a higher education and the amount never increases. Then 60,000/year until the age of 30 and the rest however he chooses. 

I think no matter how you set it up theres a downside. My thought is that i wouldn’t want my kid to just sit on their trust fund money and do nothing productive. And incentivize education and bettering themselves."

RITUS_,"HSA pre/post tax questions with Registered Domestic Partner. Hi reddit. 

I've got some HSA and tax related questions that are maybe less commonly asked due to o my situation. 

I have a HDHP insurance plan through my employer for my spouse and children. However, since my spouse and I are only registered domestic partners, and not married, my insurance costs are split:

Employee +children rate is pre tax, and the difference between the +children and +spouse and children rates are taken out post-tax.

Its early in the year but I'm on track to contribute enough money into my HSA, with pretaxed dollars, to max out my contribution limit (I think it's ~$6900)

We are expecting our third child this August, and the quote I have for her obstetrician (I think that's the right term lol) care is about $2500, but that doesn't include hospital charges. 

My plan is to pay all hospital bills using credit cards with the best reward payout, and reimburse myself through my hsa.

Will this cause any tax related problems for me if I reimburse myself for my spouses expenses?

For what it's worth, I'll be making payments in the $350-$400 range, so it's maybe less risky than doing this all at once. If there's an issue, do you think I can count on finding out about it within a month or two of my first reimbursement?  I've never used to reimburse yourself feature before, and my hsa is through HSABANK (in case that makes a difference)."

RITUS_,"If your take home is ~$2600/month you should be good for an apartment costing around $800/month by yourself. Pricier places will likely mean you'll need a cosigner or a roommate. Many apartments will want to see income of 3x the rent.

ohio_asian,"Let's take your original example. You wanted to charge 1800/mo rent, or 600/mo per person.  The mortgage is only 1200/mo.  Let's assume utilities are not included in the rent.

With only roommate as renter:

Monthly company income is 600.

Month company expenses are 1200 for mortgage and 200 for property management fee.

The difference (expenses-income) is 800, so you add in 400 and roommate adds in 400.  But he gets the 200 for the management fee, so roommate actually only needs to add in 200.

For the month, you paid in 400 and roommate paid in 800 (600 rent + extra 400 - 200 management fee) to cover the 1200 mortgage.

&amp;#x200B;

With roommate plus one more renter:

Monthly company income is 1200.

Month company expenses are 1200 for mortgage and 200 for property management fee.

The difference is 200, so you add in 100 and roommate adds in 100.  But he gets the 200 for the management fee, so roommate actually gets back 100.   
For the month, you paid in 100 and roommate paid in 500.

&amp;#x200B;

With roommate plus two renters:

Monthly company income is 1800.

Month company expenses are 1200 for mortgage and 200 for property management fee.

The income covers all expenses.  Roommate gets paid 200.   Company now has a balance of +400.  
For the month, you paid in zero and roommate paid in 400 (600 rent - 200 management fee).

&amp;#x200B;

By the way, any money you put into the property directly benefits you from month-to-month because you maintain ownership of the house (versus gettign foreclosed on).  In the examples above, roommate is paying an extra 400+utilities compared to you for the additional benefit of living there that roommate gets and you don't."
ohio_asian,"The financial way to think of this is imagine you and roommate are equal owners of a company, and the house is the asset.  All income and expenses are relative to this company.

The expenses of the house should be split equally by the owners of the company, you and roommate.  At the very least, this would be the mortgage and the property tax.  

Utilities - you can say that's borne by the company or the renters.

A ""management fee"" is fine for roommate is fine if he's the one dealing with finding renters and you're not.  He's doing that on behalf of the company.

The income of the company is based on three renters.  Those renters were originally you, roommate, and bf.  The amount of rent you charge should be sufficient, at a minimum, to cover all expenses.  If you want to offer three different rents, for example because the three bedrooms in the house are different sizes, that's fine too.

It would certainly be fair of you to pay the same amount of mortgage as your roommate, because you're equal owners of the house / company.  You need to separate the ""ownership"" aspect from the ""renter / live in the house"" aspect.  To put it another way, if you sell the house at a profit, would you expect to get half the profit if you didn't pay half the mortgage?  Should your roommate expect to get more than half the profit because he lived there?"
ohio_asian,"Chapter 13 bankruptcy plans are usually 3-5 years long, so it doesn't seem like you'd be saving any time on repaying.  I don't know whether you'd be able to keep more $ in your pocket, since I'm not familiar with what they consider acceptable expenses.  Be aware that if you're renting, bankruptcy can also affect your ability to get a new apartment (because it shows up on your credit score).  "
ohio_asian,"You may want to check with your state / city to see if they have subsidized home improvement loans that you might be able to use.  Here in northeast Ohio, there is a program that essentially subsidizes a large portion of the interest rate."
ohio_asian,"They're not stealing half of your money.  The paystub is reporting that you made $67.08 in tips for tax purposes (yours and theirs).  But you already received that $67.08 in tips either in cash directly from the customer, or the restaurant cashed you out the night you were working.  So the company is  not paying you the tips in your paycheck, since you already received it.  

&amp;#x200B;

This paystub also makes it look like they do not ask you to report your actual tips received, they just assume you receive a certain amount.  Depending on whether you actually make minimum wage over the year or not, that could potentially be illegal."
ohio_asian,"We can disagree. I think you're reading more into this guidance than I am.  This text refers to determining your share of the interest.  It does not say your share is the amount you actually paid.  The IRS expressly uses the phrase ""actually paid"" in several other publications, which suggests that ""your share"" does not have to be interpreted as ""actually paid"".  

It does say to show how much interest each of you paid, and they will accept a written statement from all parties to this effect.  

I agree the amount actually paid is a reasonable starting point for determining your share.  I disagree that it is the only answer to ""what is your share"" that the IRS will accept.

I suspect the IRS is willing to allow a broader interpretation because the deduction is capped, it would cost too much to police this deduction down to the dollar between multiple borrowers, and taxpayers may not be able to provide objective evidence for every dollar actually paid."
ohio_asian,"Yes, the collection agency can reject your proof as being insufficient.  If it ends up on your credit report, you can dispute it.  If you ultimately want to go to court, that's what the judge is for, to tell the collection agency to pound sand because your proof is sufficient."
ohio_asian,"Congrats on going to medical school!  This suggests to me that you are just panicking in the short term, and have not yet used your intelligence and education to make a plan for the next 8 weeks.  I'm probably just telling you stuff you already know below.

Your short-term problem is to increase income and decrease expenses.   

Temp jobs exist.  Especially if there are medical-related temp jobs that you are already qualified for (you should know more about this than me).  Go sign up with an appropriate agency. 

You can now take some time to identify what expenses you can cut back on.   Examples: cheaper cell phone plans, auto insurance, certainly eating out, etc.

Can you be helped in non-financial ways?  For example, do you have friends who would feed you a meal?  Even if it's only one, that's one less you're spending money on, and a good way to spend time and have fun with them and reduce your stress.   Could you do laundry using a friend's washer/dryer (assuming you currently pay to do so)? 

I assume you know when you will receive your first disbursement of student loans for living expenses.  If the date is only 8 weeks away, you can live off a credit card if necessary (assuming you're not maxed out) and then pay them off. 

If you were originally planning on working to pay for medical school (which I understand is contra-indicated), can you apply for the student loans now?

&amp;#x200B;

You've got this.

  "
ohio_asian,"1. Yes, you can qualify for HOH using your mother as the dependent even if she works.  
2. Yes, her social security would be considered when determining whether you are providing more than half of her support.  
3. Your mother can prepare a tax return anyways to determine whether she should get anything back from her work.  If they withhold fed or state tax, she may be eligible for a refund even if she is a dependent."
ohio_asian,"Look at the IRS's website for Schedule K-1, Form 1041.  Page 2 (which your lawyer may not have given you) tells you where each line of income should be reported.  That should be all you need.  This is your income from the trust, whether you received it directly to spend now or whether you left it in the trust to grow.    "
ohio_asian,"Texas and Florida have no state income tax and are physically closest to you.  Get a driver's license and a residential mailing address in the state, and register to vote there.  Hopefully you do not own property in Georgia.  That should be sufficient to show Georgia you are no longer a resident.  Sooner is better than later."
ohio_asian,"Money-wise, it will always be better if you refinance from a 30-year to a 15-year term, especially if you are in year 2 of your 30-year term, because you will pay less interest over 15 years than 30 years.   But there is something to be said for the flexibility of being able to pay a lower amount.  You would have to decide how much that flexibility is worth.

&amp;#x200B;

I am also surprised by the $6000 closing costs.  You could shop around to find a lender with lower costs.  "
ohio_asian,"1. First, get educated to reduce your anxiety.  I recommend a ""Taxes for Dummies"" or similar personal finance type of book to help you learn about taxes.  Your local library will probably carry such books.
2. The IRS should be able to give you the information you need to fill out your 1040 tax forms.  You will want your Wage &amp; Income Transcript for the relevant tax years, which you can get here:  [https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/get-transcript) 
3. If you're worried about the IRS throwing you in jail, don't be.  The worst thing that will happen is they will assess Failure-to-File and Failure-to-Pay penalties, and you may be able to get them removed under the First Time Abate (FTA) program.  You just need an accountant, not an attorney."
ohio_asian,"This might be location-based. I paid $330 for a year-round pest control plan, but I think it only covers insects, it doesn't cover mice or raccoons or skunks.  The last time I paid to remove groundhogs, it cost me $250 every time they emptied the trap.

&amp;#x200B;

At least this is only a one-time cost for you.  If you don't think it was worth it, don't renew next year."
ohio_asian,"If you were ever audited, the best evidence of course would be your name on the lease, with monthly checks clearly labeled for that purpose.  Such evidence is objective, in writing, and does not not corroboration from a third party like the landlord or your SO.

But you don't have to have ""best"" evidence.  Practically speaking, you can prove you live at the given address by showing you receive mail there, have a utility bill, have a state ID with the address on it, filed your tax return stating that is your address, etc.  You can show that you paid rent if your SO is willing to state that the expectation was you paid half the rent even if you were not on the lease, you did so, etc.   I would think this is sufficient for you to take the home office tax deduction for 2018, assuming you meet all of the other requirements for doing so.

Going forward, sure, being on the lease would help.  If you break up with your SO, note you would then be liable for the total rent payment."
ohio_asian,"I'm not sure this is correct.  IRS Publication 936 has a section entitled ""More than one borrower"" which essentially says if there are multiple people who paid interest and you only received one Form 1098, you can divide the amounts up as you desire.  You will have to make a statement to the IRS about it."
ohio_asian,"I have a disability policy through Northwestern too.  You think your father should have a disability policy, and he has one through Northwestern.  So that doesn't sound like he got screwed there.  You might want to see if he can get a disability policy cheaper elsewhere, but that's inherent in all insurance purchases.

I agree that whole life is not necessary until all other possible tax-advantaged savings have been maxed out at a minimum.  You don't provide enough information to answer whether that is the case."
TheUBERyeti,"It's going to be really hard to get her insurance rate down in the short term. 

Her bank most likely requires collision insurance, which raises the premium quite a bit. Her being under the age of 25 also raises her premium. Plus the accident...

At least it's a Honda, so you do have that going for you. 

Short term you would have to see what incentives insurance companies offer. This could be a discount due to taking a defensive driving course, or changing the payment terms. You can save a few bucks by paying every 6 months instead of month to month."
TheUBERyeti,"I mean you could write up a small contract saying he will pay you back $X in Y amount of days. 

But if he does not pay you back, I don't believe it would be worth it to pursue him for that amount of money.

If you can afford to lose $1,000, I would loan it to him, expecting it to not be paid back."
TheUBERyeti,"So Chase should have an option on their online-account system to ask for a Credit Increase. Usually they will issue a credit increase if your financial stability has increased. Either you increasing your income, reducing any debt, or even length of credit history."
TheUBERyeti,"From my time looking around at rates, Chase tended to be slightly higher compared to Capital One. Also, as mentioned before, look around and see if there are any credit unions available to you. They will have a lower rate than a larger bank usually. "
TheUBERyeti,"So there are a few things right now, and getting your monthly payment down is not the most feasible option given the current vehicle. 

If you were to buy it out right now at 24.8k, with an interest of 4% on a 48 mo loan, you're looking at ~$564 / mo. With a net total of $27,095 paid

Now if you were to hang on to the vehicle, and buy out at the residual (18,800), you are left with: 18,800 @ 4% over 48 mo, comes out to ~$424 / mo. The net total for this would be $26,375.

This doesn't factor in any trade in fees. 

Given the situation, I would ride out the lease until the end of the term. Then compare the residual to the book value. If the book value is lower than the residual, turn it in and look for a cheaper used vehicle. If the book value is higher, buy it out and sell it for book value. Then look for a cheaper used vehicle. "
TheUBERyeti,"Yes, balance transfer to pay it off.

Looking at the Southwest card, the rewards just are not that good. Plus, you're paying an annual fee right off the bat. If Southwest is the only airline available to you, and you fly on it a lot, then maybe there could be some value."
TheUBERyeti,"You can reach out to the institution about a credit increase and see if they will give it to you. This will benefit you by dropping your credit utilization. 

I noticed you referred to your credit card as your main one, do you have any other lines of credit besides the 1 credit card?"
TheUBERyeti,"The price of the property. They bought ~180k, current value ~265k. I have no idea of the time frame, but there is still a solid return if they can get that much. 

Depending on where the market goes, I would consider the appreciation or depreciation of the property part of the equation. 

There could be better investments out there, but it seems the mods have shut it down."
TheUBERyeti,"So I think your best bet is to avoid applying for a new auto loan all together. I understand that your have been working on improving your credit, but given your current liabilities and your past histories, I feel that the interest on the new loan could undue all of your work. 

Try to pay down the current loan as fast as possible, and save up as much cash as possible while you can. Start looking into cheaper used vehicles that will accommodate your needs, but minimizing your need to finance."
beeptheboop346,"That is the plan. I’m still nonplussed as to how to negotiate a 10k or so raise- and even then, that’s miles away from market average. 

You don’t know what you don’t know indeed. I saw the numbers and just didn’t feel like I was at a position to ask for it at the time. Lol. Being in the market does things to you. Thank you, I needed to hear that. I appreciate it a lot. "
beeptheboop346,"That’s one thing I keep saying to myself: “Stop. You’re only 22. It’s FINE.” However it was tough seeing people my age doing tons better. A mix of intense ambition and comparing self to others is not great. But I’m working on it :)

Thanks for sharing. That’s amazing. I don’t know how to say this in a less sappy way but I truly appreciate the tough love. 

And yes, I already plan on taking advantage of employer match and opening a Roth or Traditional. Learning even in my off hours. Thank god for this sub and all the knowledge. "
beeptheboop346,"Can’t stop beating myself mentally over my salary. A ramble more than anything. Edit: Writing it out has really helped me get rid of my negative thoughts and get out of my funk, and your comments are so very much appreciated. Thank you for the tough love PF. 

I’m 22, graduated CS in 2017 from an Asian country. I moved to CA with overblown expectations influenced by my dad (whom I do not blame, he’s nearly 55 and worked entry level all his life and thinks a degree is all you need) so the job market, especially in this state, hit me hard. I only found a job after six months despite running myself to the ground applying and that’s only because the mom of the one person I knew in the city had a job opening where she worked. 

It was an office job, minimum wage, and they wanted me to kiss their feet after giving me $1 raise after three months. I excelled at the job and their productivity soared, but the job ate at me. I wanted to do software development so badly, but the toxic soul sucking job, adjusting to a new country, emotionally, mentally, physically, living with an emotionally abusive family, and figuring out how to fit in a first world country’s software development field coming from third world was so much toll on my mind. 

Then opportunity came, and luck definitely played a part. Through another incredibly kind connection. They were looking for a junior software developer. I grabbed it instantly. I sent my resume in. The person who wanted to refer me said it was ugly as fuck. He said try it again one more time. I took the criticism in stride, actually grateful, and even paid for a resume builder thing online to properly layout my information. My confidence at this point was shot with everything going on in my life. It was so dark. I was crying at my desk. But I got it. I sold myself hard during the phone interview involving all senior developers and CEO and pushed through. I was even in a car accident (I was a passenger) two days before my in person interview but I kept going. 

This is where my mistake comes. Without properly researching market average salary, or seeing what was offered for similar titles, I threw a number so low. A number that basically reflected how much I was willing to take just to escape. Average market salary in my area was 85k. I asked for 35k-45k. They gave me 45k and I couldn’t even believe it at the time. 

A salary increase was assured once I passed probation, and it did happen. I got bumped up to 50k. 5k is huge. But I can’t stop beating myself up. People the same age as me with absolutely no experience like I did are starting at 65-70k. I felt even more stupid when I remembered the person who referred me to this job said “Oh I even know someone who they offered 60k to despite no experience”. I keep thinking what if I just said 50k-60k instead. 

I know. I can find another job, or wait for the yearly review, but I would actually like to keep this one. Sure there are other cons I have not mentioned (vacation days are poor, I missed four days of pay in December because they shut down and I didn’t have PTO) but I have an incredibly kind and generous boss that makes work very fulfilling, and sometimes that’s worth giving up +5k-10k a year. 

Yet somehow I cannot forget the memory of putting in a number that clearly showed how desperate and insecure I was, and how a little bit of confidence would’ve made a world of difference. "
beeptheboop346,"I’m trying not to 😅 I’ve been in this sub long enough to know mine’s not an isolated case and definitely not one of the worse ones but I couldn’t help it. Writing it out has been helpful though. 

Actually outside of salary issues I wouldn’t mind staying a good 3-4 years. It is valuable experience, I enjoy the work. I probably have some growth to do within the company if I do well enough. I’m sorry I didn’t mention this but I was able to leave my family, as this was a good distance away. Budget wise I am doing ok, but it involved a lot of work and planning. 

That’s definitely the game plan though, and I will keep your words in mind. This is actually my foot in the door and I’d rather have this than nothing. Thank you much!"
beeptheboop346,"Yes, I’m actually feeling it out now that I have an idea of where I want to keep working, living conditions, and budget. Once I’ve got a good year or so under my belt I’ll start to branch out. The first CS job is always the hardest. Thank you for the sub!"

hinow41,Using savings to pay card I have a CC right now that's no interest until April. I have 2k on the card right now. I have 2k in my savings account and another 3600 in a HYS. My monthly bills are around 800 a month with out this card. Think it's a bad idea to take the 2k from my savings and pay this card off completely before any interest hits ?
hinow41,I would wait until you have a good amount in the account before investing it. I was looking at doing the same thing a two months ago. Never had any medical problems and figured why not make some money on this. In early December  I had a heart attack. I'm 29 years old. I owe about 9k that my insurance did not cover. I'm so happy I had my HSA available. 
hinow41,I would put $2000 or 6months of living expenses into a  high yeld savings. That way of an emergency comes up you can have access to the money. Then open an ira and contribute to that weekly or monthly. I wouldnt start with other investments until you have these two figured out and funded.
hinow41,"Is the car you have broken? Or you just want something new? I personally would never lease, but if you like changing your car to something new every 3 years go ahead, but it will cost you more over time."
hinow41,Yea the card was a good idea at first. I did it a couple times before. Get a card offering 0% for a year and just use it to build my credit with out having to pay interest. This one just got out of hand I did a big purchase on it and I kept using it. Times almost up and I should have been more responsible. 
hinow41,Stay with 401k or put into a Roth ira? I have a 401k with my employer. Nothing is matched by them. Thinking of changing to a Roth Ira instead. Should I roll over my current 401k or just stop and contribute only to a Roth ira? I  have around 17k in my 401k a calculator online said it would be around $3750 in taxes to do the rollover.
hinow41,29 I'm I saving for retirement right? I'm 29 I have been with the company I work for for almost 4 years. I know how important it is to save for retirement and how starting younger is better. Anyway I make 45k a year and I have my 401k set up to take 15% i have around 17k in it now. My employer does not match anything. It's in their 401k in a 2050 target fund. I also have a high yeid saving account with $3500 in it now and put $50 a week into it. Last month I had a heart attack and now it's got me thinking a lot more about my finances. 
hinow41,"401k target fund or something else? Im 29 years old, making 45k a year at my current job.  I set up my 401k 2 years ago as a target 2050 fund. I have about 16k into it right now. Should I keep it in the target fund or split it up into the others?"
hinow41,"Weekly or monthly investment So I have been trying to learn how stocks work and how to invest in them. I'm using robinhood for now just to get a feel. I set it up with a weekly withdraw for $15. There is a stock I invested in with my first $100.  Got a couple shares, now it grew to $15 a share. Should I wait until the end of the month to put $60 in or just buy a share every week? "
hinow41,I would put $50 into savings and $150 to cards. Stop using the credit cards and pay them off. Interest on the cards is going to cost you more then the savings will pay in interest.  You want to get rid of the highest  interest card first and work down. Also you can save a small amount. It adds up as long as you don't touch it 
traveler19395,"Ally at 2.2% is a decent option, but keep in mind that number will change over the next two years, it might go up to 3.0 (I *sincerely* doubt higher) or could definitely go down to 1%.

Since you are pretty confident in a 2 year timeline, I would try to find a 2 year CD at around 2.8-3.0%, then you are locked into that rate for the 2 years."
traveler19395,"At 3.5% fixed 30 year it's an easy answer. I agree it's a little more difficult at 5.1%.

traveler19395,"Yes, but I would give the new owner the curtesy of settling it before contacting the labor department. Sympathize with the new owner that it *shouldn't* be his problem, but in fact it is, and unfortunately he didn't adequately understand the state of the company he was buying."
traveler19395,"The FEIE (foreign earned income exclusion) will be something you want to get very familiar with, if you spend another 6 months out of the US you will qualify and not pay any federal income taxes to the US. If you're paying taxes on your income to the country you live in you will want to understand the tax treaty they have with the US.

&amp;#x200B;

As for IRA, you can't contribute when you're taking the FEIE.  But you can still contribute $5500 for 2018 until April 15th, assuming you had at least $5500 of earned income while in the US last year.  Opening the account from abroad may be slightly difficult, but don't try to open it as a ""foreign investor"" if you are a US citizen."
traveler19395,"When you get married the FAFSA stops taking into account your parent's income.

traveler19395,"It's been great for several years of my use.  I only use it for savings, because they have great interest rates and let you open any number of ""sub accounts"", which combined with automated transfers is a great budgeting tool similar to the ""envelope system""."
traveler19395,"If your income and expenses are pretty consistent and you have a seemingly stable job, I would just keep $1k in a cash account emergency fund and then fill the Roth IRA. You can withdraw contributions from the IRA without penalty, so it still works as an emergency fund. If you do withdraw, you're also allowed to put it back, so if your emergency happens in March you can pull from your IRA and still have until December (or is it the following April 15?) to recover and replace the IRA funds.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

However, if you're a freelancer or otherwise have inconsistent income or expenses, you should treat it differently since your emergency fund is much more likely to be needed (and may be down in value when you need it). It may be that you get 3 months in a cash account before filling your IRA, or maybe the whole 6 months."
traveler19395,"If you get yourself setup well you will view replacing appliances is an occasional expense, not an emergency. If you have budgeted and are saving $1000/yr for appliances and home repair, but the month after replacing your roof both your washer and furnace break, that's an emergency.  My point is, do what you need to do to get through this stretch, but start budgeting and saving for the occasional expenses that are inevitable, like home and vehicle repair/replacement.  Then you won't feel bad about spending the money when those issues come up, and your emergency fund will stay safe for true emergencies. "
traveler19395,"&gt;Is this the same type of MMA that people suggest putting your long term reserves into?

What do you mean by 'long term'? Generally long term means retirement and/or 10+ year horizon, and money market or HYSA are *not* the recommended investment."

Stay focused on this.  If gold/silver was a great buy, the MIT graduates with supercomputers controlling trillions of dollars of funds would realize it before you and buy it all up until it's equal to other risk/reward options available.  Anyone who tells you to buy something specific (gold, Apple, Tesla, shorts, etc.) better have a *really* good reason they are the smartest or have an inside scoop. And they should be backing it up by dumping all their own money into it.

traveler19395,"No, it's not very diverse. Bonds, international stocks, and international bonds are just some of the things it's missing, then you can go into other categories like real estate and minerals. 

&amp;#x200B;

That doesn't mean it's a terrible idea though. If you are prepared to keep your money in an SP500 fund for 20+ years it *should* do quite well."

traveler19395,"&gt;Your emergency fund needs to be cash

Disagree.  You need to have tiers.  My *personal* tiers are along the lines of:  

* cash 'under the mattress'
* in a bank with local branches
* in Ally savings (2.2%) specifically for emergencies
* in Ally savings designated for various future expenses like car repair/replacement, but could be used for emergencies
* in Roth IRA index funds that could be withdrawn in the most extreme of emergencies

&amp;#x200B;

For me personally, I have about 1 month, 1 month, 2 months, 1 year, 2 years in those respective categories. That will vary significantly by the person, but I think the tiered principle should be pretty universal and my specific tiers a somewhat common structure."
traveler19395,"&gt;If a recession is looming, then the long term 3+ year CD locks me in while my savings rate is adjustable and would fall with declining interest rates.

&amp;#x200B;

Yeah, mostly that. 

The average rate for high-yield savings over the next 3 years *might* only be 1.5%.  It's very unlikely to average over 2.6%. So if you *know* you won't touch that money for the next 3 years, a 3 year CD at 2.7-3% is a good option."
traveler19395,"Technically, you should be filing and probably filing FBAR also.  Do you ever want a US passport or to have US residency?  Then you should probably do it.  If not, you can just ignore it.  I think you would also be fine making US short/vacation visits, but that depends partly on what nation's passport you have, and is beyond my knowledge."
traveler19395,"If you're planning on using it in the next 5 years (buying a house, starting a business, etc.) putting it in Ally at 2.2% is a great idea.

* Automatic contributions to your retirement accounts,
* Automatic transfers to various savings categories (like vacation, vehicle replacement/repair, home improvement/repair, etc.  Ally bank and some others are good for this, allowing multiple ""sub-accounts"")
* Automatic bill pay on all regular bills and payments from a collective checking fund.
   * A shared credit card for shared and predictable expenses (groceries, gas, etc) can be paid from the collective checking fund.

It has a section for ""negative score factors"". Now some of them I am working on, but one bothers me. ""Your largest credit limit on open bankcard or revolving accounts is too low""? If I don't really need it why does it matter? I think my largest credit card limit is 10k? I don't recall going over 4k on a single card in the last decade. Should I raise the limit on my primary credit card? 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to offset the hit I will be taking as I kill some of my unused cards. Just closed a yearly-fee Frontier Barclay card last night. I have not used it in over a year so why pay $69/year for a card that has a higher interest rate than the one I use regularly that is feeless AND I get credit back on (Amazon)?

&amp;#x200B;

Negatives below. Working on the outstanding debts now. I let my Amazon balance creep up a little. As I just paid off my car I can throw a few hundred extra per month towards it and a 3k line of credit debt at by credit union. Should have them cleared by the end of the year. I also have a small 401K loan that I just remembered, but should be cleared soon as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead you have to go to the $30 version to  get that. Unfortunate change there. Guess I will hit the IRS website  for alternatives.

Is it just me? Or is Experion deliberately making it difficult so they can comply with the bare minimum Federal requirements and not one bit more?"
09Klr650,"I used to pull eery six months using the annualcreditreport. Need to start that again. Looking back I have certainly becone ""financially complacent""! Just looked at the Chase site. 7% utilization. Weird thing is that in less than two hours I dropped one point? I thought these things were updated weekly? It lists todays date as the date of report with the next in 7 days so I must have hit it right at the update period. "

So I think I am good in that area. At least until I close one of the other cards as I planned . . . maybe I wait a few months for that now that I am thinking about it.

kholly04,"I said your 401k is garbage because your expense ratios are basically all over 1%. 

My recommendation, which follows the sidebar, is:

1) contribute to your 401k up to your match
    A) 5% should go to your 401k first to get the full match (5% = $4,500 and they will match an additional $4,500 per year unless they have a cap)

2) max out your Roth IRA
   A) either a target retirement fund, which diversifies for you, or check out the Boglehead’s three fund portfolio if you are more hands on ($6,000 = 6.67%}

3) You hav 3.33% or $3k to either an HSA if you are able to contribute or put the rest to your 401k.


401k allocation (in my opinion):

1 - more hands on approach 
     A) 70% in your S&amp;P 500 option 
     B) 30% in your international equity index fund

These are lower on fees and give you global diversification. Both of these have ERs of .72  and .67 %. 

2 - set it and forget it 

    A) throw all of your 401k funds to the target retirement fund closest to when you are retiring. These have higher fees but they do the allocation for you based on when you are retiring so all you need to do is continue to contribute.

kholly04,"As others have mentioned you are not working with a financial advisor, you are working with an insurance salesman. The policy he wants you to buy is a really crappy and expensive life insurance policy with a savings vehicle attached. With how expensive it is and the return being really low, it’s not worth it for your situation to buy it. 

What you should really do is buy term life insurance through a broker (ideally the insurance provider would be highly rated and you would look for the lowest cost policy) and then invest the rest into a Roth IRA.

Just a side note, these derogatory marks don't show on CreditKarma. 

So I can see these things but the credit report doesn't show me how to contact these organizations so I can ask them to remove them from my credit history. One was my previous college and another was a company I don't recognize. 

I also heard I could mail one of the credit bureau's directly and ask them to remove the marks but from what I see the credit report isn't telling me which credit bureau is keeping track of which individual mark. It tells me at the bottom which credit bureau were checked for my entire credit report, but there is no breakdown per transaction so I don't know who to mail. "
LittleGanymede,"IF I throw it into a savings account then I will be hit with the 10% withdrawal penalty for taking it out before 59 and a half. 

I'm looking to buy my house this year, so definitely short term. 

Also how will taxes work if I use my IRA to pay for my first house? I'll have to pay income tax on the money the year I use it to purchase the house? "
LittleGanymede,"Got a new job and looking to roll over 401k into a traditional IRA with the intention of buying my first house this year. Turns out my current employer doesn't offer non-brokerage IRA's. I work for a bank and assumed they did until I was on the phone for 45 minutes. They have a brokerage IRA but not a non-brokerage. 

I need a traditional IRA to park my funds because I can use 10k of the funds from an IRA for my first home purchase. I don't want to get into the stock market while parking the funds. How do I find a good money market IRA fund to temporarily park my money tax-deferred? How do I compare providers? Any good resources? 

What should I know about rollovers and traditional IRA's before I start the process? If after opening an IRA with somebody will I be penalized generally for using most or all the funds for my first home purchase? Are there typically minimum balance or contribution requirements for IRA's? "
LittleGanymede,"Yes. So I'll be able to use the first 10k on my first house. Which I'll use for the downpayment. Right now I have around 5k, and another 3k rolling over from my pension. So I will potentially be able to use the entire balance for my home. Though I won't need all of it for the price range of house I plan on buying. Which is max 120k. "
LittleGanymede,"The idea behind getting a property to rent is that I'll be using leverage to gain access to an asset that I couldn't normally afford if I needed to save enough to buy it out right. 

I have two options for affording closing costs. One is asking for seller concessions. Another is I can get up to 2500 on closing costs from a current special. 

Repairs I am currently saving for and I'm taking the cost of that into consideration. I'm saving right now for any potential repairs and I may even think about financing repairs to create a solid income property. "
LittleGanymede,"Great questions. 

All of these homes will be my primary residence for a year. I'm young. No wife, no kids, no pets. I am able to be flexible for the next few years in order to make the plan work. I may not go up to 10 houses but at least the first few. 

Tenants stop paying=Vacancy 

Tenants thrash the place= Maintenance reserves. 

HVAC break down= CapEx reserves. 

So, yes. Again, great questions. The rent that I charge will factor in those things. A certain percentage of the rent will be taken out monthly to account for things like Maintanece, Capex, Vacancy, etc. 

"
LittleGanymede,"You are absolutely correct. I'd have to meet a certain debt to income ratio. Plus I'd have to have a certain amount of reserves. There is only so much house I can afford to have under my current income. 

So depending on the house I get and the mortgage, taxes and insurance, I would have to meet a certain income threshold. I plan on getting a house of a certain amount this year. Which I'll be renting it out day 1. That's first year. 

Second year I plan on getting a second mortgage based on my increased income. Right now only my base pay is being taken into consideration. In year 2 my loan officers will be able to take into consideration my Commissions. Which will be at least 50 percent of my base pay. That will allow me to qualify for a loan of a certain amount, a little less than my first house. I'll rent that house out as well. 

The 3rd year is where everything comes together. I'll be able to add the rental income from my 1st property to my total income to qualify for a third loan. 

Rinse and repeat up to 10 times. After that I'll either be done and just work on maintaining my portolio or getting alternative sources of financing. "
LittleGanymede,"Yes I realize taxes will be due on it. Better now when my income will be low relative to my future income. 

Why don't you recommend going that route? Would you suggest I take a loan instead? IF so why? "
LittleGanymede,I think I'll just park my money in my current bank's IRA for now since I'm not going to be investing it. I'll look into opening up high yield savings accounts for the rest of my funds. Thanks for all the help! 
LittleGanymede,"Buying a house this year with my IRA. What should I do with my IRA until then. I'll be using my IRA as a downpayment on a house that I hope to be buying by the end of the year. I rolled over my 401k from my previous job into an IRA. My money is just sitting in IRA, liquid. A friend said I minds well park the funds in a money market fund while I am waiting to find the house. 

So my question is which Money Market fund should I use? I obviously don't want to pay fees to move my money out of the money market fund once I need to use it. What is a money market fund? A mutual fund? Don't those have high fees? How do I find a good one? What would the ""mutual fund Symbol"" be? "
LittleGanymede,"Currently renting. 

2500 is a for sure if I go with a particular bank. 

Closing costs can be up to 6% correct. I ask for seller concessions in my offers. I can even negotiate the price up in order to get them to do seller concessions. 

Financing repairs could be getting a personal loan or a credit card to help pay for repairs in addition to my reserves that I am building up. I'm saving $1000 per month as reserves. 

If I'm leveraged and the house is cashflowing, lets say, 100 dollars a month after ALL costs. Including mortgage, interest, insurance, maintance, capex, utilities, etc. Then I'd say that is an income property even though I am very leveraged in order to have that income. You'd disagree? I feel like paying off the debt is actually part of the income. Any money that goes towards paying of the mortgage is building equity and is putting cash in my pocket for the future. 

I see it this way. After 30 years I could have a 120$ asset by just putting down 5k today. That seems like income to me. You'd disagree? 
"
LittleGanymede,"You are right. Over 30 years I will have paid 210k for an 120k asset. The draw for me is that it's not my money. It's my tenants money. So virtually for me I only put 5k in the property (Plus repairs which again, my tenants will eventually pay for). I plan on owner occupying for the first year so I'll be able to get fha for 3.5% down. And after that if I want to do it again. I can owner occupy another house for 5% then move out after a year. 

&gt; Also what are you going to do when you want to buy a house? 

I don't understand this question. What do you mean? "
maria_216,"I've heard good things about fidelity, even though I don't personally use it. 

As far as the breakdown goes, think of your savings account as an 'emergency fund' ( at least 3 months of expenses) and put the rest into investments to for long-term goals. Keep whatever you want for the down-payment for the house in bonds, but since you're young, it would be a mistake not to put at least a little bit into stocks. "
maria_216,"Do you have this person's contact info? If so, just let them know that they're doing this (might be a mistake, happens to me with my company / personal cards pretty often) and ask them for the 20 bucks. 

If not, just contact your bank and say the charges are fraudulent. They'll send you a new debit card and that'll be it. "
maria_216,"DO NOT CONSOLIDATE. Debt consolidation is just taking out another loan to pay off the current loans. The consolidation company may negotiate with the credit card companies so they're okay with paid back a fraction of the amount owed, but their interest rates are astronomical, so you end up paying way more in the end. 

Just continue on the path you're on, and you'll pull yourself out of the hole eventually. Its a long, hard process, and there's no way around that. "
maria_216,"I would just pay it off all at once to avoid the extra interest. I'm not sure how many 'chunks' you were planning on breaking down the payments into but the interest on the debt you don't pay off immediately will make the real amount paid greater than what you have now. I'm not sure which is better for your credit score, I'm not as focused on those  as other people are"
maria_216,"to help with the impluse buying, go back into your credit card / bank statements for the last month and add up how much you've spent impulsively. Then for next month, give yourself an upper limit and keep track of it. Getting a budget dons't mean never spending money on things you enjoy, it just means knowing how much your spending and keeping track of it. "
maria_216,"I'm sure OP is aware of this, but \~$15k/ semester is a lot cheaper than a most public university's in-state tuition. Even going to community college for two years might not be worth giving up the scholarship (congrats, btw) in the long run. Living with family saves you a ton of money and a part time job should be able to get you at least gas money. Overall, OP is in a lot better shape than most people. Yes you'll have to take out loans, but who doesn't these days? 

One last thing; do you think you'll be able to stay with your family over breaks? Being able to work extra hours at the job when school's out could be a big help. Maybe not towards tuition, but certainly gas money and fees"
maria_216,"Maybe thinking of it as 'saving up for something' isn't the right way to think about it for you. Think about putting money into your savings account as paying yourself. So instead of just saving whatever is left over at the end of the month, put away whatever small amount you can right when you get your paycheck. "
maria_216,"You don't mention what your company policy is, but usually they match your contribution up to a certain percentage. So at the very least, should be contributing the minimum amount on your end to get the maximum match from your employer. For example, if they match 50% of your contribution up to 6%, then contribute at least 6%, or else you're leaving free money on the table. All of that is taken out pre-tax, and it grows tax-free. 

The 'post-tax' options usually just serve as regular investment accounts, which is a good option if you know that you're not great at saving on your own.  Its a nice benefit for them to offer, but its not as critical as the 401(k)"
maria_216,"Just because you don't have many set expenses doesn't mean you can't have a budget. Since your current expenses are minimal, maybe figure out how much you'll be spending on rent,food, etc. once you move out and put that amount into savings right when you get your paycheck. This way, you'll be used to having a budget once you move out. And start investing in some low-cost index funds while still maxing out your 401(k). Retirement isn't the only thing to save for, if you ever want to buy a house you'll need money you can access before you're 65

In the meantime, maybe chip in for groceries every once in a while as a 'thank you' to your parents"
maria_216,"You don't say if your parents are currently charging you rent, or maybe you have a very expensive commute. But either way, it sounds like you aren't saving much money relative to your salary. You should start saving for retirement as soon as possible (ideally yesterday). After you get that sorted, I would work on paying off your student debt faster (pay more than the $400/mo, make sure any extra gets applied to the principle, not future interest). Then you can start saving money to put down on the house.  

If you want to move out of your parent's house asap, then just start saving as much as you can. At least enough to cover the down payment, moving out costs, and 6 months of expenses. "
maria_216,"The HSA stuff depends on your employer, but it (usually) comes out of your paycheck every month, and they (usually) roll over year to year. And if you lose your job, they (usually) give you the money with the taxes taken out. I would contact HR for specifics on your company's plan. "
maria_216,"To get the card, credit score/ history is more important. Income impacts the limit they give you more than anything else.

I've heard great things about the chase card, but I have the capital one venture card and I like the freedom it gives me to spend my miles however I'd like to, plus they have a great app "
maria_216,"I get that it feels shitty to go down 25 points, but you KNOW you're doing the right thing. Don't let a number generated by a computer bum you out like that. Unless you're about to take out a new loan or something it doesn't matter.  Mine fluctuates 10+ points every month based on how much I charge to my credit cards every month, even though I always pay the whole thing off on time.  "
maria_216,"Honestly this is more of a relationship question than a financial one. Both of you have to talk it out to see which is the best option for both of you. You can clearly afford the house, its just a matter of splitting costs "
maria_216,"What most of these companies do is they basically give you a loan to pay off your debt, so you just owe another company money now. Sometimes they negotiate and the lenders are okay with only getting a fraction of their money back, so your debt may go down, but the fixer's interest rates are usually astronomical, so its not worth it in the end. Best to put yourself on a plan and stick to it "
maria_216,"Even if you found something like this I would advise against it. I get why this seems like a good idea at first, but if you think it though, you all would have to keep receipts etc to prove that the money was actually spent on household expenses to prevent someone from ripping the rest of the roommates off. And if the card is abused, everyone responsible for the payment and all your credit scores may take a hit. Just split the bills normally and everyone can get their own card if they want to."
teeesweeet,"W4 isn’t for claiming dependents. W4 is for listing withholdings. You can claim 10 if you want, legally, without any dependents, but like you said you’ll have a tax bill and likely penalties when you file the following year unless you qualify for a bunch of other credits and deductions."
teeesweeet,"You can try to justify it any way you want, but it’s not something you can afford if you are living paycheck to paycheck and a $2,000 car will turn into a money pit, which you don’t have money for. You need to earn more money or get a second job before you consider getting a car. You will spend your Uber money on gas and insurance and not have any left over for repairs."
teeesweeet,"Is your girl trendy? Does she care much about what others think? Or maybe just a little? Does she like nice things? If those answers are yes, then you’ll want to present her with a 1 carat diamond, at least. Will .99 carats make her say no? Of course not. But her friends will ask and she will feel good saying 1. The ring is to show off. Not necessarily represent how much you love her. My 1 carat diamond ring was $5,000. My fiancé now husband asked what I wanted. Cushion cuts appear larger. I have a cushion cut. I wanted to show it off. If he would have given me a smaller diamond of course I would have still said yes. I know this makes me sound materialistic but it’s honest. Don’t finance it."
teeesweeet,Was your bonus classified as a bonus? If so it was likely withheld at 22%. The remainder of your salary was likely taxed at 35% because you would fall into that bracket if you made that amount each paycheck. This is an assumption and you can always either do the math or contact your payroll department on Monday (or Tuesday if Monday is a holiday).
teeesweeet,"Turn off your lights, turn down the thermostat to 65 during the day and 62 at night (if you’re in a cold climate), find out exactly how long your dryer takes to dry a load of laundry and set the time for that amount (mine is usually 40 minutes) because most people run their dryer longer than they need to, take 5 minute showers, turn off the heat dry on your dishwasher, unplug all unused electronics, charge your phone and tablet (if you have one) at work/in the car, cut cable, get the slowest possible internet speed your provider offers, turn down your water heater. I can go on and on."
teeesweeet,"If the schooling overlaps you will want two separate accounts because you can only use the funds for the named beneficiary. Once child 1 is done, if there are funds leftover, you can rename the beneficiary to child 2. But you will not be able to use the funds for both children simultaneously. "
teeesweeet,"It’s lender specific but in most cases the lender will consider the lowest score to determine your rate. If your husband’s income will qualify for the loan, you should only have your husband’s name on the application. Your income will not be taken into consideration if you do this. They will also only consider his debts. You can have your name listed on the deed and if you wanted to be on the loan, you can refinance later when you build your score."
teeesweeet,"I never rolled it into a new 401k because I stopped working (now a stay at home mom). I could convert it to an IRA, but my husband makes too much money for us to qualify for a Roth and the annual rate of return is better than the rate of return in our traditional IRA so I’ve left it alone and I’m letting it grow on its own, obviously without any additional contributions. I forgot the plan rules for how long it takes for non-vested money to be withdrawn. I was told when I left the company but I’m not worried about it. "
teeesweeet,"You’re likely to get approved for an amount, but that shouldn’t be considered what you can afford. Also, your $8,000 saved won’t be your total down payment because you will have closing costs. Closing costs consist of normal house buying fees, plus taxes and insurance money needed to begin your escrow account. Sometimes a seller will chip in some of these costs, but usually only if they’re desperate to unload the house quickly. You’ll need a minimum of 3.5% down payment plus the closing costs in order to close. 
You’ll have to figure out, with the help of a realtor or lending firm, what the estimated closing costs will be. 

Your mortgage payment will also rise based on your credit score because that determines which rate you will be eligible to receive. Your rate determines how much interest you pay. In most cases, you pay more interest each month than principal (the amount that is actually applied toward the loan) for the first 1/3 of the mortgage term. You can follow along using an amortization schedule, which is provided to you at closing but can also be made in a program like Excel. 

It’s probably best for your financial wellness to pay off your debt, then continue to save money for a full 20% down payment + closing costs. It is also wise to have at least 6 months worth of mortgage/utility payments left over in a savings account. "
MonroeMisfitx,"I’d put it in a high yield savings account as an emergency fund since you have no debt or income. 

Look at an online bank like Ally. I wouldn’t tie it up in any investments until you have stable income. "
MonroeMisfitx,Depending on whether you need immediate satisfaction or not: put bills in order of lowest balance or highest interest. Pay minimum plus all that you can throw at it to get it paid off then roll that large lump payment in to the next.
MonroeMisfitx,"It’s easier for myself to allocate money and stick to it. I keep the cash in envelopes in a safe and we take the cash with us when we need to get gas etc. once we run out of that envelope that’s it. It helps us both to not over spend and keep track of how much we’re allowed left.

As far as the wedding goes, this is just the venue with food and drinks included and believe it or not is the cheapest we found anywhere in NY. There’s nothing to scale back. My parents are paying for the rest. 

As far as changing lifestyle I’m going to outline our expenses below. There’s nothing we do outside of necessary expenses (i.e. bills) to “scale back” the snowball plan will help eliminate all the little credit cards that add up etc.  we can’t scale back rent wise as it’s the cheapest we have found and can’t move in with family."
MonroeMisfitx,"I’m going to agree with previous poster. I’d room with your boyfriend for a month. Save up the money you need to move out and get your own place. Taking on such a high interest loan because you want to be in your own place is going to do more damage to you financially than if you just wait and aggressively save. There’s nothing wrong with rooming together, just put down a date as the goal to get out and stick to it. It’ll also allow you some time to see what your checks and expenses will actually look like so you can be certain of how much you can afford rent wise. Not sure where you’re moving to but $2500 take home a month, depending where you’re moving to, can be a little under what you’d need. "
MonroeMisfitx,"Will credit score drop? Between this and next month, I am paying off 3 credit cards and one furniture credit card loan.

Should I expect my credit score to go up or down? I’d imagine up but I’ve been reading some people suggest it will go down (I input the “if I...” info on a credit score system and it anticipates a small drop.

What gives?"
MonroeMisfitx,"I’m also a little confused. Why is there 2 cars if you don’t drive? Can he use the other car? Sounds like there are many avenues you can cut to get to goal as you’re living above your means. That takeout budget is definitely too fat as well as the little things like ancestry.com. You’re living off of one income a month which isn’t that high in comparison to some double incomes. My fiancé and I bring in over 120k a year and act like paupers to get debt down. You might have to shake your husband a bit with this feeling he deserves to spend money on things. Both my partner and I work our butts off and I can’t remember the last time I had my hair colored or bought a new outfit to “treat myself” it’s life. He can live without the extras for financial peace. If he refuses, I strongly suggest him getting a second job or you applying for disability if your anxiety is crippling. "
MonroeMisfitx,"If you see somewhere we could cut let me know I’ve cut down a lot of areas myself and told him he may need to get a part time as i cannot with my schedule.

MonroeMisfitx,"To answer your questions: You can always ask for validation of debt once it goes to collection and bring up the last name issue, but I personally wouldn’t let it get that far. Call the lab and ask them if they’re willing to take a payment plan, most will and some will give you a huge discount for not having insurance (i know Enzo labs does this) Sorry the doctor ran unnecessary tests :( that sucks. "
MonroeMisfitx,"Wish we agreed on that prior to booking! I’m the financial one and tried to tell my fiancé a wedding would be too much but him and his family wanted the wedding and started the guilt trip on us. In retrospect I wish I could go back and tell them if they wanted it they could pay, and put my foot down with him but I don’t have a time machine so I’m just trying to do my best now with the money"
MonroeMisfitx,"You already have 3 months so I’d put a hold on increasing that to 6 for now and focus on your debt. Via snowball or avalanche method and annihilate your debt. Once that’s over, build your EF to 6 months."
MonroeMisfitx,Yes we definitely got into so much debt when I couldn’t work for a bit due to hospitalization. We never recovered financially from all the bills we had to throw on credit cards to survive for that time. Finally able to pay most off and it feel great. We also built up some savings in case that ever happens again (or anything similar) it’s nice to reflect and note the problem and come up with a solution
MonroeMisfitx,"I agree with the other poster on selling your car and buying something cheaper. That’s eating a lot of money up for you. As far as the job firing her, is the state she worked in a fire at will state?"
MonroeMisfitx,"
Not all the time. I’ve paid mine on the due date to get hit with interest anyway as some cards will charge you interest on the days it takes to “process” the payment. I of course have called to fight it and get it removed but have learned to just pay a few days in advance to avoid the phone call to remove my interest charge.

"
MonroeMisfitx,"I’d say anticipating an expense 9 months from now gives you enough leg room to focus on saving for the car. Cut down on spending so much on eating out and buying online items and focus on saving for the vehicle. 

Don’t use your emergency funds for a non emergency thing.

As far as income tax goes, don’t bet on money you don’t have yet. I know plenty of people who have been getting back 12k or so every year and due to the new tax laws are looking at 2k. I’ve even read some people on here owing when they usually get a “refund”. I also echo a previous poster who suggested you fix allowances so that you can have more money in your pocket throughout the year. Using your taxes as a way to save is a bad idea as you’re essentially loaning the government money tax free. You can always take that money you get a pay check that you’re not used to and throw it in a high yield savings account. If you can’t trust yourself to do that, I’d take a better look at my budget and expense habits and make some changes. "
MonroeMisfitx,"Using Credit Cards Currently myself and my fiancé use the Dave Ramsey cash envelope system and it works great. We’re able to stay on budget and never go over the allotted amounts we set aside a month for groceries and take out.

Because of this we are paying off 3 credit cards this month, a personal family loan this month and one store loan next month! 

I keep reading that the “smart” way to handle credit cards, is to utilize cash back by all of your spending going on the card to which end of month you pay it all off.

I have to admit the idea makes sense. Can anyone shed some light on what type of expenses you put on the cards and who to do this for? My credit is high 600s (still repairing) and his is in the 500’s. I’d like to get mine up into the 700’s by end of this year if possible and was wondering if this would help.

I’d still utilize the cash envelope system...just at the end of month withdraw from the cash envelopes and pay the bills. If this isn’t a sound idea as I’ve seen/read that’s totally fine also as I’m perfectly happy paying off these cards! 

For reference, after these 2 months are done, we still have 3 credit cards left to pay off.
"
MonroeMisfitx,"She might not have a case if the state is a fire at will state since they can fire you for pretty much no reason at all. The contract she signed agreeing to pay them back, does it explicitly state that they forfeit the right to get relocation costs back from her if she’s fired without specific reason? "
MonroeMisfitx,"You need a budget to see where all the money is going and then start saving since you have no money in savings. 

Start there first. Call your cc companies and/or collections and work out payment amount of plans with collections and pay minimum on all cc cards except one using the snowball method by David Ramsey (you can do by lowest balance or highest interest - in your case since it seems you want visual results as motivation, id do lowest balance) 

Your credit needs to be fixed before buying anyway and you can save for the house. Most suggest 20% down plus closing however, I know some loans only require 3%"
tquill,"Vanguard is fine, but so are Schwab and Fidelity.

I have accounts with all 3 and my order preference is Fidelity, Schwab, then Vanguard.

Fidelity - good website, online chat support, low and zero fee mutual funds with no minimums

Schwab -good website, online chat support, low fee mural funds with no minimums

Vanguard - website could better, no online chat support, seems to requires more mailing of physical paperwork than the others (sometimes with a medallion notary), low fee mutual funds with overall minimums and higher minimums to get the best rates.

Even most people from the boglehead forum seem to recommend Fidelity and Schwab over Vanguard. "
tquill,"Just ask for all the documents in your file so you can make sure that you have copies of them all. Go ahead and make copies of them too.  They might wonder what you're doing it for, but depending on the size of the company, HR probably couldn't care less what you need them for."
tquill,"I would contact them again to verify.

The collection agency might just be who they use for longer term payment plans, and it might not necessarily be the ""bad"" kind of collections that goes on your credit report.

This is an important distinction, so I world call and triple check with them, maybe even up to a supervisor, and then try and get it in writing too (details on how the collection agency plan works).

From a business perspective, I find it hard to believe they would be so quick to sell an account to a ""bad"" collections agency (usually at a substantial discount) rather than extend payments more than 3 months. "
tquill,"Vanguard is fine, but I think Fidelity and Schwab are better. I have accounts with all 3 and the interfaces are much better with Fidelity and Schwab.

Not to mention Vanguard seems to require more physical paperwork and notarized documents when making certain types of changes.

Edit: Fidelity and Schwab also have online support chat, and I don't think Vanguard does."

tquill,"Typically, you pay yourself the interest on a 401k loan so it might be a decent option.

Taking out 401k loans is not a good habit to get in, but depending on your student loan interest rates I would consider it. "
tquill,Absolutely negotiate a better offer. Ask for what they used as comparables (they'll send you a list of vehicles). Go through the list and point out why your car is more like the expensive ones and less like the cheap ones. I was able to get an offer from 6600 to 7700 with very little effort. 
crayton1995,"I think for now I would continue to save. If you have to liquidate your investments to put a down payment that’s a high risk. I would wait and save, plus the yield curve just reversed on bonds so IF a recession is coming, buy a house in 2 years for half the price lol."
crayton1995,"So young 23 year old. Congrats on your saving and ya crypto lol.

I think it’s awesome it parents can pay for the school but I think it’s better to pay some or help with payments depending on what your child does. I would pack your retirement so then you have free cash to help them with payments but also it’s a teaching lesson. 

Your kids before they go to school or even a major need to know what their signing up for.far to often kids go into huge debt with a dream degree that pays nothing. I wish we could all work our dream jobs but it’s not reality. I’d wait and see your kids interests are. At the end of the day, your teaching them financial responsibility and that’s worth everything.

Background: middle class child, twin brother and sister. Dropped out of private school and racked up 30k student loans. Taught myself to code and now sit way higher then I thought. I work hard and learn and my brother and I own a rental house where I live rent free. All this because we learned (not taught) how to manage our money. My parents didn’t have any money for college and I don’t hold a grudge one bit. They provided 18 years of raising me. It’s time if I’m gonna spend like an adult, I better act and take on those responsibilities."
crayton1995,Read your message more sorry. I think you’ll be fine but stay hungry and driven. It pays well and you seem smart so go enjoy van life and work hard to make it possible. Rejuvenate and relax and come back to corporate hungry :) 
crayton1995,"I would just read about Dave Ramsey, I think some of his advice would help you define your financial future.

I would pay off debt even if it’s zero interest. Then get an emergency fund and then save for retirement."
crayton1995,"Um kind of, he’s my twin brother and so I understand the risk of being in any business with family. As we got older we both realized we share the same views on money and we both worked hard to be successful in our careers.

We just made a LLc and will officially have documentation stating we split it 50/50 but ya basically we split the down payment.

It works out for him because without me we couldn’t get the loan because someone has to live there so we just both mutually trust each other but are working on getting the legal side setup."
crayton1995,Agreed Midwest has great jobs and the cost of living is still really reasonable. Take a trip out to Minneapolis! Job market is great and although taxes are a little high it’s a very up and coming city with other big ones being so big and expensive.
crayton1995,I would dip your toe into front end web development. There are many different avenues to it and once you get your first break of experience. No one cares if you have a degree. I haven’t interviewed at my last 2 jobs. My current place is at a fortune 250 company and they offered me the job.
crayton1995,Depends on your field. I dropped out of school and taught myself to code. I can complain at all where I’m at for 23. Ever thought of trade school? Honestly plumbers and electricians make bank and the schooling is far cheaper.
crayton1995,"2 paths. iT is a very hot market and rewards people who buckle down and learn and build things. It’s not easy and not for everyone but pays extremely well.

I agree with a commenter above about trade school. Over time those people have high caps $40 -$60 dollars an hour. 

Wealth building takes time. I admire your fast paste mentality but realize it’s usually a slow journey. I own a house with my brother that we rent out but we’ve had to learn a lot. Flooded basement, bad tenants. There’s a lot that can go wrong . Now, we were well prepared to handle all of this but it’s slow. 

We used to say we wanted 10 properties by 30, now it’s more like 3 - 4. 

I’m not trying to discourage you, but take your time in planning all this out. Warren buffet made most his money past 50. 

I didn’t start out making huge amounts. I was underpaid at my first job because I’m a self taught programmer. My hard work paid off though but it took time, patience and willing to fail/learn.

Best of luck mate! Don’t lose your drive, always stay passionate!"
crayton1995,"So I would express this. I’m a FED and make six figures. I think you could do this for a year or two or shorter and not set yourself back. I think their are a few things to consider for yourself. Relationship goals and retirement goals. This sub is very conservative so likely you’ll get some negative responses but I’d say yes you can do it for a while an go enjoy life. I think you as a developer, need to keep your skills somewhat sharp so I’d keep a computer ;)

For your relationship and retirement goals I’d just look at it straightforward. Do you wanna get married? Buy a house? Retire comfortably? If yes to any of those I wouldn’t van life it more then a year or two and you should be able to jump back in okay.

 This is all my opinion so take it with a grain of salt but I’d express saving some more money. You’ll have to account for repairs. Spontaneous things etc

Good luck mate!"
crayton1995,1300 is enough but trading any sort of stock or etf can be difficult and most people lose money. Look into opening a paper trade account (fake money simulator) and choose your investments and give it some time and see where that accounts at. That way you can practice without losing money.
hunterhast95,"You’re a bloody idiot. I’ve made 100’s of thousands of dollars investing in the rental market. You don’t consider rental money “in your pocket”. It goes straight off the top towards your mortgage. 

He only invested $50,000 of his own money throughout the whole 10-year process. The remaining $72,000 was somebody else’s money. So he profited that $72,000 even though it went straight to the mortgage. The $72,000 was never “his money” until he sells the place or refinances it. 

Then once he sells it in 10 years that $72,000 is a realized profit and it is his money. Until then it isn’t profit, it’s money he owes the bank that the renter is paying."
hunterhast95,"You pay $500/week for utilities and maintenance??? If your utilities are costing more than your mortgage something is wrong unless the country you are in is just very cheap to buy a house and very expensive for utilities. I see that you definitely don't have much leftover to put extra towards your mortgage, but I think surely something can be lowered in the utilities area."
hunterhast95,"When I was 18 and trying to buy my first house with no credit history it was recommended to me that I go to wells fargo(I would choose a different bank if I were you) and open a prepaid or small limit credit card and keep a 20% balance on the card, while making double minimum payments each month. So I opened a $500 max limit student card and kept the 20% balance on it each month.  A few short months later when I had a 750-ish credit score I paid the card in full and it all worked out well. I never even paid any interest because of the 0% for 12 months introductory offer. There may be better ways that others will recommend but this way worked well quickly for me."
hunterhast95,"You shouldn't opt-out of paying taxes. You'll have to pay them eventually and you really don't want to get behind. In fact all of 2018 income taxes are due in the next couple of weeks. 

If it is everyday spending then really there is little reason to keep the receipts other than to return items if needed. If you cannot take those items off of your taxes then the IRS doesn't care to see the receipts. 

You should meet with a tax professional immediately and figure out what you need to do about taxes. You can't just opt-out of paying taxes in the US."
hunterhast95,"The biggest advice I can give you is: if your family isn't paying for your college, or if you aren't getting loads of grants, scholarships, etc. then don't go to a 40k+/year school. It's dumb, unless it is the #1 school in the world for your degree and you are practically guaranteed to make huge salaries compared to graduates from other schools. 

Then, get a job. Work, save your money, don't spend money like the prodigal son, and take as few loans as possible. Try to graduate with as little debt as possible. Try to get subsidized loans rather than unsubsidized because the govt pays the interest on subsidized loans while you are in college, then you start paying the interest after you graduate or quit school."
hunterhast95,"College isn't like that. People don't care that you are starting college at 20. People in highschool were assholes about stupid stuff. College isn't that way. Everybody is doing their own thing and nobody cares. I went to college with a 16 year old, multiple 30 and 40 year olds and a lady who was 67 years old when we had 2 classes together. Don't worry about your age. Honestly, nobody will probably even notice that you are a 20 year old freshman. 

Don't go out of state because you are right, you will pay a premium for absolutely no reason. Go to a community college if you want, or you can go to a 4-year, it doesn't matter. Just go and try to pay for as much of it as you can without loans. "
hunterhast95,"I have to disagree. OP won’t save enough money in 3 years time because of the difference in rent vs. mortgage to even break even. Between closing costs and interest, OP would lose money unless the place appreciates very well in 3 years."
hunterhast95,"If all of the money you ever put in was the $20,000 and another ~$30,000 in monthly payments you would double your money in 10 years... $50,000 invested turned into $100,000. That’s an average of 10%/year non-compounding. But that’s not how it would work. You’d have property taxes, repairs and maintenance, vacancy, closing costs, etc. 

The best way to calculate average returns would be to 
1. figure out all of your expected expenses from start to finish and add them up = total investment
2. subtract that from $100,000 selling price = profit
3. Profit divided by total investment = total return in %
4. Total return divided by 10 years = average annual, non-compounding return

On a real estate investment like you’ve outlined it is all about (positive) cash flow and this investment would be negative cash-flow(hence your monthly re-investment of $250). Unless you have some kind of value-add opportunity or you think you know something nobody else knows about future appreciation and you want to make a speculative investment this is generally considered a poor investment."
hunterhast95,"This is a typical spot delivery. Now whether or not they’re scamming you by knowingly sending you home in a car you wouldn’t get approved for or plan to give you $0 of your money back is up for debate...  however even if this is a spot delivery scam, it’s no more illegal than tax evasion...."
hunterhast95,"Okay, then you might actually be exempt. I assumed you were working full-time and making over $12k. The requirements are to pay taxes if:

Your unearned income was more than $1,050
Your earned income was more than $12,000
Your gross income was more than the larger of $1,050 or earned income up to $11,650 plus $350. "
hunterhast95,"No it won’t have a profit until he sells it. Look, it’s simple. His income for the year is $7,200($600/mo). His expenses are $10,188($849/mo).

His expenses are higher than his income. He’s losing money on all sides of this deal until he sells the property in the end. Then once he sells he will pay taxes on his profit from renter’s principle pay-down, appreciation, etc. 

How do you see a profit of $3,000/year? You must not be counting the mortgage of $849/month which IS an expense. An expense that puts this property in the negative profit (loss) category. It’s not that hard."
hunterhast95,"First, I would recommend visiting https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/independent-contractor-defined and some other it’s websites to determine if your arrangement would legally be considered a 1099 Independent Contractor agreement rather than a W-2 employee agreement. 

Depending on what you will make in a year as a 1099 contractor, I would recommend saving 20-30% of each check for taxes, because you’ll pay self-employment taxes. Once you know how much money you’re making on average, you will most likely need to file quarterly income taxes. "
hunterhast95,"So where is it going? Based on your income and the bills you listed that is how much should be left over. If that isn't how much is leftover then you need to track down where it is going, see if it is a necessary expense and try to start saving that money to be used to downpay your mortgage faster."
hunterhast95,"In order to get the best answer on a question like this, most of us like to see the following information:

1. Income
2. Mortgage Amounts
3. Other Bills and their amounts(rent, food,car payments, literally everything)

Without info like this, we cannot help you try to change the way you are budgeting, all we can really tell you about this scenario as you have wrote it is if you want to pay it off quicker, you need to find a way to make more money. If you provide the info above, I would be glad to try to help you further."
hunterhast95,"Oh, well if that's the case you should have money leftover each week.

1200 income-500mortg/utilities-180food-40phone-100cars-50misc = 330 Leftover unless I am missing something. If there is $330 leftover and your mortgage is only $315 you could send a double payment every month and pay it off in something like 10 years. "
hunterhast95,"How do you think you can invest 50k in 9 years +355 days and have $100,000 the next day?? You really think that $50,000 investment doubled in 24 hours? This only works if you actually have the property for 10 years!"
hunterhast95,"Consolidate. It’ll take forever to pay them off by paying minimum payments. Looks like you owe pretty much 30% of a year’s salary. Depending on your other bills, you could potentially cut your misc spending and pay this off in a year. 2 years should be a breeze."
hunterhast95,"It takes 10 years to pay off the loan... and you’ve only invest 50k personally. So if you got the mortgage with 50k invested in 10 years minus 1 day, you wouldn’t have 100,000 the next day. You would have the same 50,000 you invested and the bank would have the other $50k that you owe them on the mortgage. So if you sold it for $100,000 the day after buying it you get 50k and the bank gets 50k. You can’t make a real estate investment and the next day sell it without paying off the mortgage.

You also can’t make less than a minimum payment, which is the $849/month. So I don’t even understand what you are trying to get at."
hunterhast95,"Who is your cell service provider? I would bet they have a payment plan for a new phone. No it’s not ideal and usually I would never recommend buying a phone on a loan, but I bet you won’t be able to cancel your student loan payment... though I could be wrong. And you have to have a phone in today’s world. 

Perhaps you could buy or borrow a cheap used phone to get you by until you have saved up the money in a few weeks to buy a new phone?"
hunterhast95,"Another commenter says the car is in your mom's name. If this is the case, have her call the cops and label the car as stolen. They will try to retrieve the car, but even if they cannot for some reason, insurance will kick in(assuming full coverage because it has a loan against it) and pay for or replace the car. "
hunterhast95,"Money handed over to family should always be considered a gift. Chances are, it won't come back. Don't loan your parents money anymore. It is apparent that they are going to use your generosity against you by ""borrowing"" money they don't intend to give back. Don't hold this against them though, just forget about the money you already gave them and then don't ever give them anymore money unless you don't want it back."
hunterhast95,"The stock market is its own beast. I’m vastly experienced in both. 

If the property has negative cash flow(which this scenario would) YOU DONT PROFIT A DIME in the month-to-month scheme of things. You actually report a LOSS in the short term because you are bringing in less than the property costs you ($600= income $849=expenses)."
solorna,"If you guys have enough money, you can qualify for bank account bonuses. Usually this entails finding a bonus you qualify for, opening the account, completing the qualifying activities, and following up to make sure you receive the bonus.

I like this website for the current bonuses:

https://www.doctorofcredit.com/best-bank-account-bonuses/

This is not working, but you (or your spouse) will receive a 1099 tax form at the end of the year because the bonuses are considered bank account interest. There is no way that earning interest is going to be confused with working. 

*DO NOT* open a joint account if you decide to go for a bank account bonus. Your spouse can do it, then you can do it, picking up the same bonus twice.

You can also use *your regular spending* to pick up credit card sign-up bonuses. I use Doctor of Credit and this website to pick up credit card bonuses:

https://www.hustlermoneyblog.com/credit-card-bonuses/

If your regular spending is small, then chase the small bonuses. I am literally looking at a Kroger card right now that pays $100 if you sign up for the card and spend $200 on it. A $200 spend can be knocked out easily - cell phone bill and groceries. 

You have to keep very close track of what needs to be done to qualify for the bonus, when it needs to be done, and pay off the card(s) in full each month. There is no point in a bonus if you then pay credit card interest rates because you forgot to pay the bill."
solorna,"So I see that every time you posted asking for help you got redirected. From PF to FIRE, from FIRE to the Daily, and then from the Daily back to PF. Please do not be discouraged. Do the flow chart and start following the Daily FIRE thread."
solorna,"&gt; Does that apply even when I put my gross income instead of my net income?

Yes. You are fine. No one is going to verify your income. And even if someone did attempt to verify, you already corrected it. Gross pay = before taxes, net pay = after taxes. You can stop stressing out about this and take a shower or eat or read or whatever chills you down."
solorna,"&gt; but damn if i dont find it jarring that the company is more comfortable with the DUI offender. candidate A can’t kill anyone with credit card debt.

Obviously I don't know the particular company being discussed here, but I once had a job where credit checks were done just as described in this story. The company's reasoning was that a financially unstable person is more likely to commit fraud or embezzle. "
solorna,"&gt; I would get the meter checked and see if the power company has a program to evaluate energy efficiency in the home.

Do this. Also check for rebates in your area for energy evaluations. We do it every year and it costs like $175 but for the past two years we've gotten a $100 rebate back."
solorna,"&gt;  I am just worried I will go to jail for fraud as I didnt mean to fill out false information. 

This isn't going to happen. You are completely fine. Just read more carefully next time. *Usually* the question IS annual income which is why you made this error to begin with."
solorna,"&gt;someone who is about to graduate college and start working

&gt;is it worth the $95 annual fee to get the Blue Cash preferred

You have no idea what your expenses are going to be due to the massive change of graduation and starting your real job. 

In your position, I would get the Blue Cash (not Preferred) and carry it for a year or so. That will give you a baseline of what to expect. *Then* you can run an analysis to see if upgrading is worth the $95/year for you. You don't want to end up in a position where you earn $104 and pay $95 in fees per year, when you could have taken the free card for, say, $80 in earnings. "
solorna,"&gt;I'm thinking of moving half. Does that seem logical?

No, move all of your savings into a high interest savings account.

&gt;My thought process being if I get my card number swiped they can only take a couple thousand from me

Stop using a debit card. All it does is expose you to unnecessary risk. Use a rewards credit card and pay it in full each month.

"
solorna,"&gt;Step one: Get rid of capital one. They will continue this crappy behavior. It's how they make money.

&gt;Step 2: Demand a breakdown of how they charged for interest. Keep your billing cycle date in mind. This is key. There may be overcharges or even compound interest (interest charged on balance + previous months interest added to balance)

&gt;Step 3: Get a better card from a more reputable company or credit union.

Can you please recommend a credit card that doesn't charge interest on balances not paid in full? I've never heard of this."
JacqiPro13,"Wow this is incredibly helpful and I really appreciate this comment! While dealing with the credit cards first *was* our original plan, sadly his ex is tied to this collection as well (old apartment she co-signed for him, but only he lived there so it’s solely on him), and she’s been getting very impatient with him about it getting paid and removed from reports. I don’t blame her, but that being said that’s why we’re rushing to get that paid and hope a PFD works. Thankfully we’re about 2 1/2 months out from having the money. And definitely, we will be dealing all of with this via Certified mail. 

And thank you. We were really struggling and just realized we couldn’t continue towards a future with this debt weighing on us, so we’re trying to nip it all in the bud now. To be frank, it sucks haha. But it’ll be worth it."
JacqiPro13,Yeah I figured that was just the first of many to pop up. If I find that a loan would be the way to go I will definitely hunt for the best offer. I’ve got a friend whose mom works in a credit union so at the very least I can consult her about my options. Thank you!
JacqiPro13,"Keep paying down credit cards or take loan offer?? SO and I are currently in the process of paying off our debt. We are doing this opposite-snowball effect approach, so what we’ve been doing is saving every penny after monthly bills to throw at a large collection debt ($7k), while still making early/on time minimum payments on all other debts (car payments &amp; credit cards).
However, once we have the full $7k saved by April, we will then be able to start increasing all of the payments and even doubling them on our other smaller debts. After recently checking my credit reports on credit karma I noticed I was pre-approved for a loan offer of the exact amount of my total credit card balances. Here are the credit card balances, as well as the loan offer:

Credit cards:

PNC Core: balance $1971/min monthly pymt $55/Annual APR 21.24%

Value City Furniture: balance $1228/min monthly pymt $44/APR 29.99%

Citibank: balance $1020/min monthly $27/APR 21.24%

Chase: balance $990/min monthly $31/APR 25.24%

Goodyear: balance $831/min monthly $32/APR 30.74%


Starting in April, I can pay $100/month to each of these cards, or two $50 payments (if this would make a difference?) In total I’d be throwing $500/month at my credit lines and they’d be paid down at approximately the end of 2020, or beginning of 2021. I could probably increase that payment a bit, but we also wanted to finally put money aside for an emergency savings, as well as increase our car payments, so I thought $100 on each card was a decent monthly payment.

The loan I was offered:


Loan: $6040

Min monthly payment $224/mo for 36 months

APR estimates 19.95%

Interest and fees $2035


Now while this monthly loan payment is lower, I could double that each month and pay it sooner, thus paying less in interest. I’m very very hesitant about taking out any loans, as clearly I’m on a mission to pay down all of our existing debt by cash, and I’m unsure and too inexperienced with loans to know which option would be the best for me. Any advice/recommendations? Which option would save me money/benefit my credit long term? Thank you!"
JacqiPro13,"I checked my credit report and the collection account has disappeared, but hadn't been paid. What does this mean? I had a $700 collection on my credit report (creditkarma) as of 2016 from my last semester at community college. I checked my credit today for the first time in a few months, and was pleased to find along with my score improving, the account had disappeared. Nothing on my report, TransUnion and Equifax, noted the account being paid or closed, or even existing. I've heard sometimes CAs will sell a debt to another agency and the account may temporarily not show until it's bought by the other CA, is this true and could this be why? I will keep a close eye on it because I know these situations are too good to be true and the debt doesn't just suddenly disappear. However I'm hesitant to reach out about it because I don't want to reset the SOL (I'm not sure the exact SOL for this specific debt, but I live in Maryland).

Please note this was **not** a student loan. I was paying for my classes out of pocket on a 4 month payment plan, but did not make the last couple of payments. **I checked the wiki but did not find any information specifically regarding accounts just disappearing.**

Advice would be much appreciated!

Additional question: does anybody know if the SOL on this specific Maryland debt would be any different than the standard SOL of 7 years?"
JacqiPro13,"Hey, fellow Marylander here. Yeah, looking at the breakdown of each check is brutal. MD is expensive, but unfortunately, I'd say it's pretty accurate if you currently have ""0"" withholding. This also means, however, that your tax return will be higher. A few people already recommended it but I can't stress enough how it helped me since I knew next to nothing about this myself, check out the IRS withholding calculator. I recommend using the **Turbo Tax** one on their website (it's free) because it walks you through every step and uses layman's terms. I adjusted my W-4 from ""0"" to ""2"" allowances, so they take a little less out of my check each pay period. However, this means I will receive much less money in my tax return next tax season, which I personally am fine with. But be careful, above a certain number of allowances (again Turbo Tax calculator will show you with a sliding scale between 0-9) and you will end up owing money next tax season (meaning my employer did not take all of the required taxes out of my income for that year). Again, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It all comes down to preference. But if you owe over a certain amount ($1000, I think) they can ""penalize"" that and add a fine. Good luck, friend!"
trug4m3rgirl91,"Your mom is 44 and she can't get her taxes straight, what makes you think she'll be able to handle a $4500 mortgage?  If she doesn't sell the house, she's going to be making $4500 monthly payments well after retirement age until the mortgage is paid off and that's quite a lot during retirement. 

Regardless of what I think, trust your own gut feeling - you're apprehensive because you're afraid she can't afford the mortgage. You are absolutely correct. 

If you do choose to help her, just remember, you will be assessed a gifting tax of anything you gift your mom after $15k for the year. Also, she will be falling back on you for assistance when, not if because $1500 is not a lot to work with to save/eat/pay utilities/insurance/etc, she's short on money and needs your help again. Be prepared to not get the money back if you are expecting her to pay you back.

Good luck OP!"

Life isn’t going to be fair and people will take or try to take advantage of you. Move out and struggle like the rest of us. The situation does suck and wish you guys the best though.

Ricklepickle6,"I’d probably spend a small portion to get a degree or get a certification to make me worth more on the job market. 

Keep 40k semi liquid for maybe house down payment. 

Put the rest somewhere that has exposure to the stock market. "
Ricklepickle6,"I’m sorry for your loss...

You cannot afford it, but as a group possibly. A house is a long term loan so I’d say you run a lot of risk pooling money together with a partner and a sibling. 


Financially, I’d be best to let it go.
"
Ricklepickle6,""" didn't contact the gas company because I know it's not my fault""  Sounds like you need to grow up a little. You were provided a service and don't want to pay for it? Nothing is free and you are to blame just as much as the gas company. 

You should call them, discuss it like a man(woman) and hope they are gracious with your theft. "
Ricklepickle6,"Honestly, if what you're saying is true about the standard deduction, then my problem is solved. I just wanted to get around using AF for my 401k. Even there money market account has a .66% fee. So if the 12K + 6K + 2.5K is a possible tax deduction, then I'll just take the hit on the rest. 

&amp;#x200B;

Could I rollover my 401k annually to my vanguard IRA? If so, I could contribute over 6K and add more for retirement."
Ricklepickle6,"I mean unless you buy a house for cash flow purposes, I’d say either retire or buy/invest in a business that generates cash flow so you can stop working.. or save a lump sum and go low risk/dividend stocks and pull 4% a year"
Ricklepickle6,"The responsible/irresponsible argument depends on what you do with the other $1500 you have for the rest of the month. 

If you’d like to save money then it’s probably going to be harder. 

If you’d like to enjoy the present and not plan for the future then it’ll probably be easier. "
Ricklepickle6,"I think, if you're not moving in the next 5-10 years, then you should try and put that 24K (rent) a year into equity and build you net worth.  You have the funds to do that.  As for the 401k.. id probably do a vanguard backdoor roth IRA (has less restrictions), that  way you can replace the money you used for the real estate with the same index funds if you wanted to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: Calculate all your expenses for the month including rent, then times that by 4 or 5. If that is more than 10K than beef up your efund.  Other than that I think you have a really solid base to build you net worth. Granted I don't know your liabilities."
Ricklepickle6,"How to drop tax brackets.. 61K a year and 401K w/ American Funds Hello financially responsible people. I have a question regarding my income and how to drop below the 22% tax bracket. So taxable income would have to be $38,700. Lets say I make 61K a year. That means I have to get rid of $22,300. I am eligible for 401K in Feb. 4% employer match. 40K student loans @ average 4.29%. 25 years old

Im filing single

&amp;#x200B;

**Solution in a perfect world:**

$18,000 in 401k

Take standard deductible of $12,000

Bracket goes to 12%

&amp;#x200B;

**My problem:**

My employer uses Edward Jones and therefore only provides American Funds for 401K. I hate their fees.

No employer HSA

&amp;#x200B;

**My attempt to avoid 401K:**

Open and fund IRA  with Vanguard - $6000 deductible

Pay Student Loan Interest - $2500 deductible

That leaves me with $13,800 that needs to be sheltered from taxable income.

&amp;#x200B;

Any suggestions?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I know that only $22,300 will be taxed at 22% but will that same amount be taxed at 22% at retirement?

Edit:  12K standard deductible in addition to IRA &amp; interest deductible eliminate my concern. Answered by  [wijwijwij](https://www.reddit.com/user/wijwijwij), thank you."
Chaseccentric,"Rather than look at a percentage of your savings, you should ask yourself this:  What amount of my net worth would I be comfortable losing for this particular item?  For example, if you have only a few grand saved up and you want a designer jacket or purse, would you really feel comfortable spending $300-$500 on that item and losing 16% of your savings just for a feeling?  Let's be honest, luxury items are really about feelings, not usually 100% based on practicality.  Especially clothing.  "
Chaseccentric,"Two vacations per year isn't exactly what you should be doing.  Imagine 60-year-old you looking back on those (what will end up being) 10 or 15 vacations and thinking, ""Wow, that was kind of a waste.  I was just staying in hotels for a few days every six months.""  You need REAL adventure.  Try staying in a different country for a month or two every six to twelve months.  Trust me."
Chaseccentric,"Just embrace the journey.  You can read about other cultures, but until you're there, experiencing it, you can't really prepare for culture shock.  That's part of the fun, honestly, but read up on faux paus and whatnot (laws, too) so you don't really get yourself in trouble.  

When you're there, do NOT spend more than a few hours in your hotel each day unless you're tired or need rest, then maybe five hours or so before going to sleep.  Stay OUT.  You're not there to experience a HOTEL or AirBnB.  You're there to see the land, the people, experience the culture.  Don't get me wrong, it's amazing to see other buildings and houses, but don't spend too much time on that.  Some AirBnB hosts are incredibly generous with their time, as they just use it as side income.  Some will have dinner with you, take you out on the town, et cetera.  It's almost like getting a free guide with your staying price.  Don't expect that, but do remember that some of them love meeting new people as well, or else they might not even be doing AirBnB in the first place.  "
Chaseccentric,"Yeah, airline cards aren't worth it if you like paying full price ($1,200.00 round-trip) for airline tickets!  Airline cards are horrible if you like spending your hard-earned money, rather than essentially flying for (almost) free with two hours of ""work.""

Seriously though, don't listen to this guy, he has NO idea what he's talking about.  How do I know?  I travel for free thanks to airline cards. "
Chaseccentric,"Trust me, if you're frugal for a few months or hopefully longer -- you'll look at your savings and think, ""Wow, how did I get this much money?""  It's your money.  It's your work.  It's your ""energy.""  Guard it, protect it, and ONLY spend it if it meets your budgeting system and guidelines.  I'd rather act like a grandma for six months and have $3,000.00 in my bank account than ""have fun with my buddies"" and spend like crazy for six months and live paycheck to paycheck and stress like a little child when one little car repair pops up, you know?"
Chaseccentric,"Okay, well, you should set yourself a budget.  For example, I put aside roughly $150.00 per month for travel and/or miscellaneous (luxury) spending.  I just keep track of when or if I use said budgeted money.  I haven't used it in four months, so, today I have $600.00 of ""fun money"" to do whatever I want with.  You should start doing this, so you know whether or not you can justify certain purchases.  Watch this:  Ask yourself, ""Have I had any car repairs, speeding tickets, or emergencies in the past few months?""  If the answer is yes, hold off on your big purchase.  If the answer is no, tally up what sort of random expense COULD HAVE happened in the past three months and then use half (or all) of that amount to get yourself something nice.

Imagine the car repair and speeding ticket that did NOT happen in the past three months, that could have happened.  Those two things could have cost, easily, $600.00 to $1,000.00 (tallied up together).  So, use half of that and you should still be ahead, theoretically speaking, you know what I mean?  $300.00 is a fine amount if you answered no to that original question..."
Chaseccentric,"“There is only one fact that takes into account the size of your available credit and that is Utilization.”

False.  Your credit score is composed of roughly six different factors. Utilization and total credit limit are two of them.  Don’t mislead people. "
Chaseccentric,"I've been to many countries.  My average trip costs roughly $2,000.00 for six days.  That's roughly $333.00 per day (everything included, except lost wages, which I actually factor in as well in my notes).  You can go to Japan (round trip) for about $1,000.00 if you carefully scan for good tickets.  With a nice sign-up bonus from a credit card, you can sometimes fly there for free (yes, I'm being serious).  AirBnB, hostels, and even the friendly people of other countries make living arrangements vastly more easy than in the past decade.  

You can stay almost anywhere (usually AirBnB) for about $40.00 per day.  Add about $20.00 per day for food (yes, that's perfectly doable if you go to their local markets to stock up on food).  Just walk or hitch rides with friends that you make while traveling (yes, you should be making friends, that's the whole point) -- $0.00 for travel expenses while ""in country.""  I've found that I could usually cut the costs of my trips down to roughly $1,500.00 or even $1,300.00 if I really tried and combined a little ""roughing it"" in with my ""fun, adventure and travel.""  If you want to get your feet wet, set aside $2,000.00 and plan a trip for a few months out.  Buy the ticket about a month or two before you go, that will save you $200.00 usually.  About two or three weeks before going, purchase your AirBnB/hotel/hostel.  If you plan very well, I promise you can go almost anywhere on Earth for a total of $2,000.00.  I've done it many times.  In fact, if you went to Thailand, you could stay there for as little as $20.00 per day.  A ticket might cost between $850.00 and $1,200.00, but it's such an interesting place."
Chaseccentric,"I think you misunderstood me.  The Chase United MileagePlus Explorer card IS an airline card to me (in the context of how he was speaking, at least).  Maybe you meant an airline card as in ... an airline loyalty program or something, which isn't what I was talking about."
Chaseccentric,"Don't be scared.  I've traveled to VERY dangerous cities all alone and was fine.  Just be aware of your surroundings, don't go to shady places, don't go out too late at night, et cetera.  Also, do you really want fear to keep you from traveling this big, beautiful world?  Don't let you, fear, or anyone else, for that matter, keep you from one of life's most incredible pleasures -- world travel."
PurpleBreakfast1,"Thanks for adding some information. Here are some additional details that would be helpful. How much is your mortgage a month? What's your budget look like? Where does your monthly income amount go to? If there are some high spending areas they may be able to be dialed back to help offset future months where freelance work isnt as plentiful.

Do you have a credit card? Could you get one, pay your mortgage with it and then pay it off in full right when you have the money available?"
PurpleBreakfast1,"Did you enter your itemized deductions in and let the software decide for you? People forget state and local income taxes paid is included in itemized. If not, I'd go through and enter all itemized deductions to make sure you didnt miss something."
PurpleBreakfast1,"Every year you wait you get older when you graduate. If you want to go back to school do it. You have one life to live. If you have to take on some student loans, just make sure to pay them off with discipline. As long as you have a sound financial gameplan, do what you want. My wife is going back to school at 25. We are taking on loans. She is loving her new career path and we will be able to pay it down when she gets her career job."
PurpleBreakfast1,"If you paid everything you listed and he contributed nothing you would have -$117 at the end of the month. You'd still have his $3,400 for a net positive monthly income of $3,283. You should have PLENTY of income left over to tackle all of the debts if these are your only expenses. 

Let me know if I'm missing something or if you haven't listed everything. With $3,200 left over/month you would be able to pay off the $588.45 27% CC, the $623.98, 18% loan, and a huge portion of the 17.65% CC debt.

PurpleBreakfast1,"When you get married you share debt. My wife married me and my 40k of loans. Together we work to pay them off.

PurpleBreakfast1,"If you dont have one I wouldn't open one unless you're disciplined. Also, if you're unable to pay mortgage then date nights, fun stuff, should not be happening. It sucks to sacrifice but it also sucks to be evicted. I would sit down and create a budget that outlines where all your money goes. Then find a way to cut back where possible. Also listen to the others about job hunting. Best of luck man! Just stay positive/motivated and 20 years from now you will have forgotten all about today."
PurpleBreakfast1,"Repair or buy a different car? Hey reddit,

I have a 2007 Saturn Ion with 140k miles on it. Current issue is the recalled fuel tank leak. Had it repaired with used parts but the issue came back. Thankfully the mechanic refunded since it was within their warranty period. A new mechanic that has really good ratings said he can fix it with new parts but it would cost $1600. I bought the car last year for $2,000. I have a bonus coming in March that would allow me to purchase a car for $5000. 

Should I fix the car for $1600 and 'save' $3400?
We had planned to put the 5k towards loans since we still have 30k


Thanks!"
PurpleBreakfast1,"Best way to get/increase my wife's credit score? My wife currently does not have a credit card or score. I've had a credit card for 8 years and have a score of 780. Can I add her as an authorized user and get her a card to establish her own score?

We want to buy a house in 3 years and I would hate for a lack of credit score on her end being a detriment to being approved for a home loan.

Thanks!"
PurpleBreakfast1,"There isnt a reason she doesnt have one. She just hasn't gotten one yet. We have a budget, etc. Might as well just have her apply for one. Didnt know if AU with my score would raise her score faster than starting from scratch"
Oneidas,"While there are a few special butterflies that claim to have high 700+ scores without having car and a mortgage, for most people you have to have had a mortgage and paid off multiple car loans with perfect credit otherwise to reach such a score.

Merely having perfect credit payment history will stagnant somewhere between 680-740 for most people depending on total available credit limits.  You have to take out traditional loans or mortgage debt with a decently long history to go higher.

Note when you first take out mortgage debt your rating takes a hit for the first year."
Oneidas,"At worst your looking at having to wait until you can provide two months paystubs with a decent income. Apartments tend to care way more about income than they do credit scores, as long as there’s no evictions on your record."
Oneidas,"I generally don’t think a Roth is a great idea unless your top marginal tax rate dips into the 12% range.

You really have to be in a rare situation to benefit from a Roth.

Roth IRAs main benefit is their flexibility. Mainly the ability to take out contributions tax free should you really need them.

For Roth 401K they lose much of the flexibility that is their main advantage.

Go with traditional on the 401k in 97% of cases. Put a little on the side into a Roth IRA for some flexibility."
Oneidas,"If you have 401k funds then taking out a loan from those, that you then pay back as soon as possible would likely be cheaper. Don’t know how much you have in those.

That’s after the 10k Ira withdrawal that is penalty free."
Oneidas,"It’s for the child!!!

Why wouldn’t it still be 100% in the stock. They’re throwing millions of dollars away as it is and you want to throw away more!!!

The child still has like a 30-50 year horizon...

Sorry... not understanding opportunity cost makes me sick.

Ps The riskiest part of this portfolio is the cash, closely followed by the bonds. Over a long enough time horizon cash is the one asset guaranteed to be almost worthless."
Oneidas,"You guys are reading the 401k match wrong imo. My wife’s is like this.

They match .33 on every dollar he puts in, as long as the matching dollars don’t exceed 10% of his total income.

If he put in $10,000, then they match $3,333, as long as he makes at least $33,333 per year.  If he only made $30,000 per year the match would stop at $3,000 in this scenario.

If he can put in $19,000, the they would match $6,270, he’d just need an income of $62,700 or more to get it all without hitting the 10% cap.

That being said, he should ignore all of that and pay down his debt.

If it was a more traditional match where they match the first 4%, dollar for dollar then that’d be a different story, as that’s an immediate 100% return. But that’s not the case here.

Pay off the debt. The interest compounds at those 15-23% rates indefinitely. Which is much scarier than losing out on the one time immediate 33% return, imo."
Oneidas,"Quite frankly if you have anything at all I retirement before you’re 30 you’re ahead of the game. That said, if you can slowly increase your contributions close to 20% by the time you’re in your early 30s you’re practically set unless you’re trying to retire super early."
Oneidas,"Ally or Synchrony Bank

Ally has more comprehensive service, which you may not really need, but if you do it’s the one.

Synchrony tends to edge out ever so slightly with better high yield savings. Which is what most people use online banks for. Service has also been good. I use them personally.

Both are very good imo."
Oneidas,"Also never put large medical debt on a credit card.

Just save up an amount usually 40-60% of the bill, and then call them up and say I’ve got this much cash if we can settle this today.

Medical debt rarely gets charged interest, though it will be turned over to collections at a certain point. Still, the collections can be cleared once you settle them, usually for much less than you owe,  because the whole system is messed up. If your insurance company can pay $0.40 on the $1, so can you. You just have to have cash and be willing to negotiate.

Lesson for next time. 

"
Oneidas,"Without getting into a deep discussion:

1) Cash/currency is the one investment almost assured to be worth or approach nothing over the long long haul. Either inflation or failing to be an accepted currency(failed state) will do it in.

2) While a single company will almost certainly cease to exist at some point an index of top X number of companies will almost certainly not, barring total world annihilation. 

So over the long long haul your choice really boils down to do you want to have something or nothing.

To invest, or not to invest....

"
Oneidas,"Mathematically the best return will almost always favor traditional, due to the ability to transfer the amounts to a Roth on a ladder schedule late in life at the lowest tax rates possible.

Of course, there’s a chance the tax system changes drastically, but that is pretty unlikely.

Also if you have like $3 million+ already saved in a 401K, then you probably can’t ladder all that money, and switching to Roth makes sense. For the .00001% this statement applies to, a Roth 401K is for you.

For the more normal person, the Roth makes since only once your AGI drops into the 12% marginal tax bracket. Some will say below the 24% marginal tax bracket, but I very much disagree with this sentiment. 

This is not to be confused with a Roth IRA, which offers additional benefits that a Roth 401K does not. 

If you want some tax diversification then I’d strongly suggest predominantly contributing your traditional 401K, but also set aside some in a Roth “IRA”. "
Oneidas,"If the discount was reported on your w2, and you entered it as such on your taxes, then you get to add this amount back to your basis on your schedule D.

Your broker will not add this basis back for you. Most programs have place to check to adjust the cost basis reported on the 1099B

Although in your situation I believe it will all be charged at the capital gains rate and therefore, no short term discount will be reported on the w2."
Oneidas,"You can’t really negotiate federal loans because the gov guarantees them so you have no negotiating power.

Assuming you don’t have something with higher interest rates over your head then I see no reason not to pay in full unless your interest rate is just super low (like 3% or less).

That said talking to someone won’t do any harm.

Also make sure there’s no taxes your responsible for on the inheritance.

Lastly, it will not fall off your report, but not actually being in delinquent status should still be a good bump within 3 months."
Oneidas,"I mean in the US the entire situation is illegal, not sure about Canada.

Can’t pay off student loans with a line of credit, unless you can covert it to cash first. However, it would still be illegal if the payout was ever reviewed.

Reason being you could pay off non dischargable student debt for dischargable personal debt."
Oneidas,"If I could borrow $1 billion dollars at 0.99% I would. Just saying.

I don’t know why this is available in your country, but if there is not some catch, then this would be an arbitrage opportunity. Basically you can ensure a gain on the money with no risk.  Or add a small amount of risk, for much greater gains."
Oneidas,"You could call to see if there is a min payment associated with the account once you reduce the balance to a low amount.

I don’t really have a problem with your plan assuming you have reason to need a higher credit score in the next 3 years. Car, home, etc.

But if no reason in the near future, then it really makes no diff."
Oneidas,"Without knowing the specifics your dad basically just said he wants to give the government several more hundred maybe even thousands of dollars this year for no reason.

You can file independent. You likely won’t owe anything and all extra deductions and credits your dad could have had will just go to waste."
Oneidas,"Correct on the super risk adverse. Much more often than not you’re far better off investing it. Don’t pull it out till your a year from making your plan a reality. If by some chance the market crashes right before you want to pull it out, then it’s not like you’re forced to take it out.  What’s an extra year or two when the plan has a 4 year variance in the orig planned timeline.

Hell, over a 7-10 year horizon the market may have just crashed and you’ll still be far ahead of where you would have been with CDs/bonds over the same timeframe, poorly timed crash and all."
Oneidas,"Wouldn’t bother moving it. The difference is not going to be significant between your 401K and the IRA, for just a one time thing.

Would check with HR. They should typically send a notice for you to opt out of having a bonus check auto hit your 401K like a normal pay stub."
Oneidas,"I agree with what Rahdmal said orig. If you’re truly one of their top performers companies will bend over backwards to keep you most of the time (yes, even in the USA).

But the trick is you really got to be as good as you say you are. At that point asking for more money should go in your favor, but if nothing changes within a year, go find a new job. Sadly, companies do often pay the most to new hires, and fail to promote from within adequately."
Oneidas,"Yes, it would def be smarter to put it in a 401K.

I don’t recommend buying insurance when you don’t need it. You’ll be better off buying when you have a actual reason. Such as family, kids, or a large mortgage if you’re the primary source of income."
Oneidas,"Agree. If you can get a really low interest rate 0-2.5% it’s almost always better to stay liquid, and just make the payment. 

I get the debt just drives some people crazy, but if you’re not one of them I prefer math. You can invest that money elsewhere and make far more than what you’re charged on a car loan if you have good credit 700+."
Oneidas,"If you’re near a big city then the trend appears as though if it will keep going up, or hold steady at worst.

It’s the cities in the middle that could go either way.

And of course the rural areas which will soon have no one left but the robotic farm equipment owned by large multinationals.  Unless the robots become self aware and decided home ownership is a great idea, probably not a lot of appreciation."
Oneidas,"If you have all her information then this may be a fairly easy job for a forensic accountant to help you track down any unclaimed assets in her name. There are programs they can run to help find these assets pretty easily, but only an accredited person (usually a CPA, or something similar is allowed access). 

From there the accountant or an estate lawyer can advise you how to proceed with the claim. All this will not be free, but as long as you’re relatively certain there’s a few thousand dollars or more to claim, then it will likely be worth it."
misleadinglesbean,"Take care of your own financial health and buy them some financial books/classes.

misleadinglesbean,"There are advantages to a roth ira that a traditional does not have. You do not need to worry about RMDs, you can give them to your children when you die, you can withdraw minus earnings without penalty after 5 years of ownership. It's too basic to just look at your tax situation with tax laws constantly changing so you have to consider all of the pros and cons. 

The ideal amount is the max, $6000 this year or $7000 if you are 50+. 

You may also self-direct your IRA or have a company do that for you-at a cost. You can invest in low risk IRA CDs/savings accounts, stocks, bonds, kinda anything you want really. 

I'd personally have a roth with whomever you have a 401(k) with just so you can see the full retirement picture more easily. You can also assess your risk easier if the company allows complex analysis which brokerage firms do. "
misleadinglesbean,"I thought about making separate funds for stuff like this. One fund for general emergency and the rest detailed for known figures like your annual deductible, cost of glasses, car payment/repair. Then I realized it was too much work and to just save for a house and while doing that call it my ""F-off fund"" so if I need to use it for something besides a house downpayment I can tell Murphy to F-off. 

The way I look at it now is I have 3-6 months of expenses + 20% for a house of X amount. I don't change my %, I change the value of the hypothetical house. Don't ask me why, this just makes more sense to me."

misleadinglesbean,"After your EF and putting money into retirement, look into an IRA for additional retirement and long term savings. That's only $6k a year so at 75k/year salary it is an easy investment to fill up. 

Saving for a house will take 3-8 years anyway so starting soon makes sense anyway! It really depends on your area and the market but saving 20% + closing costs + moving + improvements is a good idea. Ex. I am looking at the 200k-300k range for a house so I want 40-60k + 10k-15k + 2k + 10k roughly = 62-87k which is a lot to save! The longer you have to save this money the easier it feels on the wallet."
misleadinglesbean,"So your net worth is around -$14k. 

I'd personally stop contributing to the HSA unless you actually have health issues. Especially since your employer contributes some for you. I'd also drop my 401 contributions to 6% and take the money you were putting into that and the HSA toward the debt. 

Everyone wants to quit their job and travel, how about keep your job and travel or get a job with a travel requirement?"
misleadinglesbean,"The great thing about a ROTH IRA is you can deduct contributions at any time penalty free, so it essentially is an emergency fund for expenses that can wait up to a week to pay off.

If you feel super comfortable in this job then definitely do it. I wish I would have started my ROTH ASAP instead of waiting to build up a big EF honestly. Wasted two years trying to feel comfortable, have never touched the money. "
misleadinglesbean,"Do the benefits of a ROTH IRA appeal to you? It won't lower your current tax bill but any earnings are tax free. You can also withdraw contributions with no penalty at any time, no need for mandatory distributions and you can will them to your children and they as well do not have to withdraw money if they want to give it to their kids. 

It really depends on if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket later on, your tax bracket in retirement (impossible to plan for but people bring it up), and how you want to live your life.

ROTH IRAs are great for those planning to retire a few years early since contribution withdraws are penalty free. Great for those planning to have kids and want to pass down wealth. Great for those in a low tax bracket currently or living in a state with no income tax but wants to keep options open in the future. "
misleadinglesbean,"For your proposed budget how much of that is rent? A lot of places nationwide want a first, security (1 months rent), and last months deposit. You'd need a \~5400 cash deposit on day 1 assuming it's all rent. That is a very critical component, no cash on hand = no housing.

misleadinglesbean,"You could do a month to month lease maybe or save up enough for 6-12 months worth of rent money and be willing to prepay most of your lease up front.

misleadinglesbean,"Let's be clear: DR's plan is for people who are so financially illiterate they have debt for beer. If you listen to him he abhors people who use credit for everyday expenses and splurges. That is why he wants you to pay down debt first, as a punishment for the extravagant lifestyle people drown in. 

Now, he would be mad at you for having a car loan of 25k but this is your life. If you called him, he would probably tell you to sell the car and get a cheaper car. Sometimes this advise is dumb because the expensive car is a work car (think heavy duty truck). 

Comparing the debt interest to a savings rate is not constructive. The point of DR's ideology is that ANY debt is sinful, makes you a slave and should be avoided whenever possible. It isn't about the rate of return, it is about morality. If you do not believe this side of it then continue to pay the minimum on the loan until you've saved enough to satisfy yourself."
misleadinglesbean,"You're saving a ton which is good but if you want 20% down on a 600k house you need to save 120k which at your savings rate will take two years, not bad! Keep putting that in a savings account somewhere to keep it safe, automate the transfers if you have to. That's just 20% too not closing or moving so factor that in and maybe save a little more.

Ya'll are doing fine technically. Lots of food expenditures though but you make enough. 

130k in debt is a lot too and if it bothers you put more into that each month, otherwise with automated savings you can have a full downpayment on a house in two years. "
misleadinglesbean,"OT at a job may allow you to earn more PTO which some employees allow you to cash out 1-2x a year on top of using it normally. Some jobs give you extra bonuses for working enough OT as well. If you have a retirement plan with this company, extra hours with them will put more into your retirement fund as well.

However, tutoring could be good experience for your future. So it really comes down to if you need the tutoring experience for future jobs and how your company structures benefits. "

misleadinglesbean,"Depends on what the ETF vs mutual fund is invested in. On the whole they are both buckets of investments made for you. Pick an energy ETF or energy mutual fund and they are both invested in energy companies. 

A lot of differences were already discussed but I think the biggest consideration is how active you want to be with your investments. If you want to be very active investing then ETFs might be better since you can day trade with them and as others have said, less taxable events happen (ROTH makes this irrelevant though).

If you are the type of person to check your investments often, ETFs can make you anxious as they go up and down with the market. MFs tend to just change at the open so you only see it grow over a longer time period.

I like having a mutual fund to invest my dividends throughout the year as well. I'm not a super active trader but money stored as cash is money spoiled. Once you hit their minimum you can add pennies at a time whenever you want. All of your investments are active this way. "
misleadinglesbean,"It's about control for me. With my ROTH IRA I can self-direct and pick very low cost funds, high dividend funds, real estate, heck a lot of things can go into an IRA. With an employee plan you're stuck with their funds, their fees, and subject to whatever policy change they decide. 

Also you can always withdraw ROTH IRA contributions penalty free in case life happens and you need the money for something else or you want a tax sheltered account for early retirement. "
misleadinglesbean,"Loss leaders. Fidelity already has funds that cost 0.015%, way less than vanguard, but they just had to push a little more. There are only 4 funds and I couldn't find them without a special google search so I don't think they are trying to advertise them that hard. "
misleadinglesbean,"The best thing you can do to start is to automate savings. Hopefully, your job does direct deposit and can add multiple accounts. Add your savings account and put a certain % that you are comfortable with each paycheck. If you are too tempted to move your money immediately out of your savings, open a savings account at a different institution and DD it there. Out of sight, out of mind. 

This is what is called an emergency fund and as Dave Ramsey says, it keeps murphy (murphys law) away. Being prepared for emergencies tends to make you not have any emergencies, it's really nice. 

Once you have a couple of months of expenses in that account, attack that debt by automating transfers or overpaying each month. 

Without seeing your income and budget or at least expenses it's hard to say what else to do. If you're really bad with money though, the best thing you can do is take control out of your own hands and automate as much as you can. "
Leprophobia,"Maybe just ballpark the replacement cost of things like the tv and bump up the amount in your emergency fund.  

Personally, if I were to drill down into itemized monthly transfers for everything that could break (and need replacing), I would go crazy and/or never budget again.  

Edit:  Not saying that accounting for things like the TV isn't important, but if it so important that it must be replaced immediately, then that should be part of the emergency fund.  It may not be an *actual* emergency as most people would define it, but personal finances have room for the personal."
Leprophobia,"If it is a choice between taking classes for a semester or fixing your teeth, I would choose the latter.  Take the semester off, work as much as possible to save up a financial cushion, and get your teeth fixed.  Re-enroll next semester with a better smile and wallet.

Before all of that, get a second opinion from a different dentist.  I know too many people that have been told they need expensive work that they did not actually need.  Shitty dentists take advantage of people that know their teeth need work.  Best case scenario, you save a bunch of money.  Worst case scenario, you have 2 different quotes for the work, and a few different financing options.  

&gt; I need 4 dental frowns.

This made me laugh a little :)  Good luck to you!
"
Leprophobia,"Emergency funds are generally recommended to contain approximately 3-5 months of expenses.  $20K is right at about 3 months worth of gross income for you.  You might play with the number a bit one way or the other, but I would put a prioritize your emergency fund.

Also, I would warn you away from jointly purchasing a house with a friend.  There are a million ways that this could go poorly and only a few ways for it go well.  Cheers!"
Leprophobia,"If you are applying for a new job, you should discuss your future salary, not your previous one.  Negotiate the new salary based on market value and your experience not based on what your old job paid you.

You should definitely ask questions about the compensation package at the new company.  Ask about all of it: vacation, sick days, bonus, stock options, etc.  Ask about specific goals needed to hit merit increases and/or open up additional opportunities."
Leprophobia,"You clearly outlined the cost of the phone.  However, you left out all of the information describing your personal finances.  Edit in some pertinent info about your finances if you want anyone to be able to offer advice.

How much do you make?  How much debt do you have?  Is your emergency fund completed?  Are you contributing an appropriate amount to your retirement funds?  How much of your budget is set aside for a new phone and/or fun money?

"
Leprophobia,"&gt;is my maximum contribution still $19,000 for 2019 or can it go above that with the employer?

The employer match does not count towards the 19K you can contribute.  There are some neat things self employed people can do in this space as a result.

&gt;can I contribute $19,000 and my employer contribute $5,600 for a total of $24,600 per year?

Yup, exactly this.

&gt; Is that an average increase each year or was this year higher/lower than normal?

I don't know about an average, but it goes up around $500-$1000 every few years. [This article](https://www.financialsamurai.com/historical-401k-contribution-limits/) includes a chart with all of the increases since 1978 if you want to see what has happened in the past.  

&gt;Lastly, keeping in mind market fluctuations, is 6% growth per year a reasonable assumption if I'm not cashing out for another 10 years (or possibly more)?

Maybe.  10 years is an awfully short timespan to predict.  I feel comfortable using 6-7% growth when I model my finances, but I am looking out a bit further out.  Of course, anything could happen and you have to plug something in to the calculators, so 6% seems as good as any number to me."
Leprophobia,"&gt;I need to save most of it for a class in the fall 

This is a need.

&gt; I’d like to get something nice for myself AND my Mom

This is a want.

If you want to break a small piece off for a new book or a decent dinner, I doubt anyone is going to be bothered by that.  However, the financially sound thing to do is to prioritize the known educational expense above any short term wants."
Leprophobia,"If I were you, I would be initially looking to spend more like $3-4K on the car instead of $7k.  You can always upgrade a little down the road, when your credit card is paid off, and you have a bit of an emergency fund stashed away.  In the short term, however, you need a vehicle of your own and it doesn't need to be anything but reliable while you start getting caught up.

While paying the minimums on your loans, I would prioritize a small emergency fund (~$1k), save for a car, pay off the credit card, and then work on the student loan. You could consider beefing up the emergency fund a bit after the credit card is paid off in order to give you a bit more security while paying down the larger loan.

As far as retirement savings, I would get the small emergency fund and the car purchase out of the way as fast as possible.  Your lack of those things really is just tempting fate.  All it takes is a breakup or a small emergency to start your finances going in the wrong direction. 

After those two things are squared away, I would probably only invest in the company 401K up to the match until the credit card was paid off and I had a better emergency fund.  Once you are comfortably sitting on a solid emergency fund and no debts except for your student loans, then you could look into doing some more retirement investing.  You would need to balance it against the interest rates on the loan and your own tolerance for risk, but that is the timing I would look at for revisiting it.


Edit:  FYI, this is all just a narrative version of the [prime directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) from the sidebar.  Make sure to read through it though since it explains things more thoroughly than I did.  Cheers!"
Leprophobia,"If you didn't get a new phone or spent less on one, than you could put that money towards your student loan debt.  So, you are effectively borrowing money to buy an upgraded phone.  

You are choosing a want over a need here.  It doesn't mean that it won't work out or that it is some life altering amount of money.  But, at the end of the day, you are choosing to prioritize an expensive phone upgrade over paying down your debts.  

From a purely financial and numbers standpoint, I would recommend that you buy something less expensive and only after it becomes necessary to upgrade.  From a life perspective, I don't have a problem with it as long as you don't make this sort of decision a habit in all aspects of life.  If you are generally frugal and thoughtful about what you purchase, then it is probably fine to splurge a bit.  If not, then this is a bad habit to get into.

It is easy to justify eating out, a vacation, a newer car, a top of the line phone, etc in the microcosm of that single purchase.  However, that behavior in a macrocosm is what leads people into pretty bad financial situations.  You know you, and you know your situation and behavior better than anyone here, so you will have to make a value judgement as to whether or not this particular phone is worth splurging on.


As an aside, you sound pretty responsible and thoughtful.  I do wonder if you asked the question because you knew it was not the ""most responsible"" thing to do.  This advice is as much for the average person that may read it later as it is for you.  I don't really want someone else to come along and just see a person in debt get told it is OK to get a brand new phone.  The blanket answer is no.  If all of your other stuff is sorted out, then I won't argue it, but paying off debt is financially more important than having a nicer/newer phone.  

Cheers and Good Luck!"
Leprophobia,"If she didn't work there long enough to be fully vested, then they could drag back their contributions.  It all depends on the company vesting schedule.  She should speak to the companies HR department and/or review her policy manual.  11 months isn't really a long time to work somewhere, so it wouldn't be all that strange is she owed the money back."
Leprophobia,"Real estate investing *can* be great.  However, you have to compare it to other opportunities.  In order for real estate investing to be worth it, you need to be able to make a ROI better than simply tossing it into an index fund.  That alone can be difficult after factoring in the mortgage, repairs, insurance, vacancies, legal fees, and the time you personally spend dealing with being a landlord.

Unless you are married, don't buy a house with someone.  I say that because both marriage and mortgages are long term commitments.  Too much shit can change over time, and even well meaning people rearrange their life in different directions and at different times. "
Leprophobia,"Pretend that you dumped your savings onto one of your credit card debts.  In the event of an emergency, you would have an extra $4k available to borrow on that card.  Otherwise you are paying CC interest on $4k for the privilege of looking at it in your account.  

If your debts were $4k less than they are now, would you borrow that money in order to stash it in your savings?
"
Leprophobia,"You will pay a 10% penalty and be taxed at your nominal tax rate.  Further, you are losing out on an astronomical amount of compound interest in your retirement account to do this.  

Barring some really strange circumstances, I cannot see anyone recommending this."
Leprophobia,"Others have discussed the potential for payment scams, but I wanted to mention the title transfer part.  Make sure to look up your state laws about how to correctly process the title.  Some states have requirements on the seller to file paperwork after the sale.  You don't want to be end up the legal owner of a vehicle that someone else is driving.  Make sure to read up on it and do things the right way.  Good luck to you!"
Laundry_Service,"It's not stupid either way. How long will that $53k (soon to be $60k) last if you lose your job? As long as you have an emergency fund of 6 to 12 months you could reasonably use some of the excess savings to pay down higher interest debts. It might make more sense to try to pay off your student loans instead of the car.

What other debts do you have? Are you saving for retirement? 401k available? Matching?

Lots of possible variables here."
Laundry_Service,Why would you be paying capital gains twice? You could also use the money after you cash out to find an IRA or use to bump up your 401k contributions. It seems like free money you're leaving on the table if not.
Laundry_Service,I would probably max it out. You're getting a hefty discount on the stock and Comcast does seem like things are going fairly well. A possible strategy to consider would be to withdraw the money that's been in there over a year as you make new contributions. If you sell the shares you've had for over a year you're only paying taxes at long term rates which is likely fairly low for you.
Laundry_Service,It doesn't have to be an all or nothing situation either. Save half and use the other half to pay towards the principal. Or put it all in savings and pay down chunks when you feel like it. As long as you're not spending the money on other things that aren't saving it's not going to make a significant difference in your net worth. OTOH putting it all into savings does give you more flexibility if any other unforeseen situations pop up.
Laundry_Service,"A couple of things here. You only pay capital gains on the money you make. If you buy 1 share of a stock for $100 and sell it for $110 you will be taxed on the $10 not then entire $110. If you use that money to buy something else and make some more money off of that you aren't being double taxed.

If you want diversity you should probably purchase index funds or ETFs.

What would you be doing with the money if you didn't increase your ESPP contributions?"
Laundry_Service,If you have more than 6 months savings I'd just go ahead and pay them off and treat yourself to a nice dinner. Then I'd focus on a 401k if you have one and a match and then an IRA. Congratulations on getting rid of your student loans!
Laundry_Service,"I would suggest in this order:

Build up emergency fund of 6 months of expenses

Pay off personal loans. Why did you get these anyways?

Pay off student loans.

Max out 401k and other tax advantaged accounts.

Figure out an investment plan and contribute to that.

Be selective and wait for a good deal on whatever real estate seems appropriate for you."
Laundry_Service,"If your credit card rate is higher than your mortgage, which it probably is, pay the cc off before additional mortgage payments. Don't take your money out of a 401k and pay a bunch of penalties and tax to handle this. Perhaps consider reducing your 401k contributions to the minimum necessary to receive the match. You could also get a 0% balance transfer."
Laundry_Service,$60k is a nice emergency fund since you're a single parent and have a mortgage. I'd probably also suggest putting more into your 401k and less into CDs. If you insist on have more in CDs I'd suggest opening up a savings account at Ally or somewhere similar and have some money where it's slightly easier to get out without penalty.
Laundry_Service,It's not going to make a huge difference either way at this point. Go ahead and split it up the way you'd like and when it's time for the next contribution put the new funds wherever you see fit. You're also free to make changes along the way as well.
Laundry_Service,"The only time you aren't paying interest is when you pay the balance entirely and have a month where you start off with no revolving debt.

You can also call the credit card issue and ask if they will lower the interest rate. Some have success with this."
Laundry_Service,"This doesn't answer your specific question but I think it's not a bad plan to finance a reasonably price car that you expect to be reliable with a low cost of maintenance than buying a junker for ""cash"" and getting stranded, expensive mechanic bills and tow fees."
Laundry_Service,You can roll it over to Fidelity for a no fee HSA. You may need to do a little digging to understand the correct way to move the money but it shouldn't be a big deal. I use my HSA as another retirement account and it's 100% in an SP500 fund.
Adviceforthewilling,"I hadn't even began to look at capital gains tax rates but you're right in that the that tax rates as so much lower than earned income. Which may put this as a much more favorable option that other investment opportunities too (if others are presented). It's quite low in comparison! They really do want to influence you into investing as much as possible.

Before converting, I want to double check something and it makes sense in my mind but I need to write it out to ensure it's accurate.

Since I get no tax credit due to my income level on my traditional IRA contributions, (and in effect, I am getting taxed on the full amount), it would make the most logical sense in my position to simply convert to Roth right? That way I at least will not get taxed on my earnings.

2. Just to confirm, let's say 2017 and 2018 have a total contribution of 11,000 in my traditional IRA (before growth).

I want to see what else they primarily have to offer aside from fund management and if they have paid hourly advice instead (for example) among some of the other questions here. 

If I end up not aligning with their offering I will absolutely not proceed to work with them.

Muddbiker,"Not disagreeing with the others here, but you should understand why brokers often start showing more house.  In buying or selling a home the home buyer's or home seller's perception as to value can make or break how negotiating a deal goes.  If a broker shows someone a house that is at their number, it is natural for a potential buyer to go from house to house to house looking for every expectation to be met.  If the broker starts you at the house that checks all your boxes, but is $100k more than you were planning on, you might be more agreeable to giving up on some of your must-haves.  We all want the perfect house, in the perfect neighborhood, with all of the right rooms and features.  Often our dream house may be out of reach of our budget and the broker wants to perform a reality check quickly, rather than after the 25th house they have brought you to see.


Same goes for selling.  The broker will often set a low expectation on price, because it is easier to close when the buyer is thrilled to be getting more than they expected.


The common belief is that the broker is pushing to grow the number and increase their commission.  An experienced broker wants to close - quickly and often.  They are not fighting for an extra $10-20k in the gross price.  They rather have a smaller commission after two weeks and move on to the next sale, than have to service someone's endless inquiries and calls and visits for 3 months for an extra $1,000.  They will make more turning over sales rapidly. ($50k at 4%, will likely be less than $500 more to the broker - they might be splitting with another broker and the agency gets a large piece, sometimes leaving the agent as little as 15% of the total commission) "
Muddbiker,"Looking for Adjustable Home Equity Line of Credit advice I was hoping to get a sanity check on this.  I need to refinance a BoA loan that was part of my original mortgage.  It has a $106k balance, with a balloon payoff due in about a year.  I have a mortgage broker buddy who recommended a friend at BoA to re-package this.


BoA is suggesting:

 - Line of credit

 - Variable rate tied to the prime rate

 - No closing costs

 - First year discount of about 1.5%, down to about 4%


My gut tells me:

 - Variable is risky, especially at the moment

 - Introductory discounted rate is for noobs who can't see or calculate long term


Am I off on this? Any thoughts or suggestions would be helpful."
Muddbiker,"Originally totaled closer to $550k.  One part traditional at a lower rate and a piece that we intended to pay off almost immediately after the purchase, at 8.75%.  Rates are much more likely to go up than down in the foreseeable future, leaving me uncomfortable with the adjustable.  Will shop around and focus on fixed rate."
Muddbiker,"This is your answer. The company is required to keep payroll records, including W-2's. They are still subject to audits for 2016. They must provide you a copy in a ""reasonable"" timeframe. If they tell you they do not have them, get the full name of the individual telling you this and explain that you will just pass that on to the DOL, IRS and your state taxing authority. Will likely change their position."
Muddbiker,"Even though the company ""went bankrupt"" and was delisted, that does not mean the stock is valueless. Bankruptcy proceedings would eventually get to what, if anything, shareholders will receive. This could take years.  You may not have a reportable transaction yet. Check to seeif the company has an ""investor info"" section on its website. If that is not an option, contact the attorneys handling the bankruptcy.  Best guess is this is not a 2018 tax reporting event yet."
Muddbiker,"How is the money being reported? (Ask the organizers) Form 1099-MISC - Non-employee Compensation? If that is the case, you will be paying self-employment Social Security and Medicare on this.  The cost to you will be $76.50 (.0765*2*500).  There will likely be other taxes (Federal income tax, state income tax, possible local/city) on this you will have to pay, but would need more info to estimate. $500, less the tax cost to you of $76.50 will net $423.50.  Round it down to $400 to offset some of your other tax costs.  Divide the $400 evenly among the team. Report the $500 on your return and pay the related taxes yourself.  You will likely end up with less than the others, but this would be a simple approach and no one could question the fairness you applied."
Muddbiker,"Business records (like this) are also required to be kept at the place of business.  If it is too stressful, request it in writing and send by certified mail. That will get his attention and will also provide proof that you requested it (keep a copy).  Good luck my friend."
skinnybandit,"Question about transferring my Merrill Lynch account. I have a Merrill Lynch 401k account through my employer. I am going to open a Roth IRA through Fidelity soon, and would like to transfer my 401k to Fidelity so they are under the same company (Fidelity). My question is can I transfer my employer 401k account to Fidelity? My employer matches 6% into my 401k, if I am able to transfer my 401k to Fidelity will my employer still match the 6%? Or do I have to keep my employer 401k with Merrill Lynch? I am new to investing, so this is all still new to me. Thanks for the help."
skinnybandit,Best company to open a Roth IRA account? I would like to open a Roth IRA soon. I was wondering what companies are recommended? Unfortunately I won't be able to go with Vanguard because I don't have the minimum required to open an account with them. I've heard Fidelity and Schwab are good choices. Do these two companies offer a target retirement date like Vanguard does? I don't think Fidelity or Schwab require a minimum amount to open an account with them (correct me if I'm wrong). I already max my 401k through my employer. Thank you for your recommendations.
skinnybandit,"Question about doing my taxes? So me and my wife made less than $66,000 last year. I know we can file for free from the IRS website. My question is when I go to the IRS website and click on free file it gives me about 12  different websites to go to (such as extaxreturn, turbotax etc.) I would like to know which website other people have used that you would recommend? I have 1 W-2, a 1099 DIV form, and something from financial aid. My wife has 1 W-2, and a 1099 misc form. Would we still be able to file for free with all these forms that we have? We live in FL so we don't have state income tax. Or do you think it would be cheaper to go to a place like H&amp;R block or another retail place? I just want to get all my options.

NearbyFuture,"Honestly, why are you considering a new car? The return on investment is terrible. Have you considered a used nice car in the $6k-8k range? I think the general guideline is somewhere in the 25% range of your yearly pay which would you you about 9k on the upper end"
NearbyFuture,How to report to the credit bureau as a landlord My dad has two rental properties. Both with younger renters with fairly weak credit due to their relatively short amount of “actual credit”. The have both been good renters (pay on time). I told him it may help them out to report these good payments to the bureaus to help get them some established credit. I have a two part question. Will this actually help there credit and secondly how would he go about that? I see you can pay to file a negative credit “attachment”. How does he go about reporting good ones?  If this isn’t the right sub I apologize and will take down if informed as such.
NearbyFuture,"What exactly does your hobbies include? I bought my last two cars with roughly 80k miles both about 8 years old and put a good 100k on each (I drive about 30k a year so it didn’t take too long). I made sure to have both inspected thoroughly by a dealer and luckily I didn’t have to put more than a few hundred buck into them a year. My point is there are plenty of good used cars out there that will require little to no maintenance. Not sure why you are stuck on this under 40k thing. Is there something significant about that number I’m missing?

Edit: I should add they were both around $5500. I could afford a better car it just really made no sense (to me at least)"
NearbyFuture,What new car were you think of that would accomplish that for only $20k? (I’m not trying to be antagonistic just trying to figure out if a new car is really your best choice) and from a strictly finance standpoint it’s not on a $36k salary (that doesn’t mean you won’t get a loan for it)
NearbyFuture,You may be forced to get her declared “incompetent” (or whatever variation her state uses). She will be eligible for state assistance with finding a place to stay as well as you or someone state appointed can take over her finances. Giving her an allowance rather than all her social security at once.
beefarooni55,Uh well did you also factor in the taxes on gains from when you cash out in the future? $200 over 30 years is negligible. You should just do it. Use tax advantaged accounts if you are not already doing so
beefarooni55,"Yeah but ""what if"" she burns all her savings on unsellable stock and spends her days harrassing other vulnerable people because she's trying to avoid the dissonance caused by the fact that she made a really poor choice?

Draw a line in the sand somewhere. If she can't meet a certain goal in a certain amount of time then she quits and looks for a real job. She needs to track her revenue and expenses so she can't forever lie to herself. It's okay to try this and fail...as long as there is a clear definition of failure. It's not that 1% get lucky because only the *first* 1% get lucky."
beefarooni55,"That...is nonsense. Yeah maybe his tax liability would be different if his life was different, but using that as an excuse to make you feel terrible is what we like to call abuse. I'm going to guess his math is wrong on this one, though"
gingerzombie2,"Right? We were paying $1350/month for a 1 bedroom plus loft (basically a 2 bedroom) outside of Denver *seven years ago*. (Before the Denver real estate market took off). 

First, OP quoted a huge range. Second, OP is on crack."
gingerzombie2,"Keep in mind that they may kick OP out of the house if they do that (new account, wanting to only pay a set rent amount). Which is fine if OP can afford a new place to live, but most college students working (I presume) part time cannot. 

OP, what kind of job do you have? If you are a waiter or similar where you get cash tips, open a new account for your cash tips and keep it a secret. The rest of your income could be handled a number of different ways, from putting your foot down (ramifications you know better than us) to going with the flow until you graduate and can get out.

I'm sorry your parents are financially abusing you. I would encourage you to find a way to save a portion of your pay and make a plan to leave. If you aren't tipped, I would set up direct deposit for part of your check to your own account and then claim to your parents that your hours got cut (to explain less income). 

P.S. nobody can force you to go on vacation. "
gingerzombie2,"&gt;Your pulls will be within a short period of time

Not necessarily. Most preapproval letters I have seen are good for about 3 months. If you do another credit pull more than 30-45 days after the first it counts as a second pull.

&gt;they don’t actually make a large negative impact on your score

Again it depends. If OP has a borderline poor score, it will affect it more than if they have a good or great score, and people close to a threshhold need to be careful.

Source: am realtor. OP, you should chat with your lender about this and about your current situation. If it may be a while before you find *the* house, it could be better to wait to get a new preapproval until you are ready, as your lender will already have all your other info and it'll take no time at all to update it later. Again, this depends on a lot of things we can't discern from your post. Best of luck!"
gingerzombie2,"The only issue I can see with suing them and then removing the lien when they don't show is, you won't win in small claims if the judge does not have proof that the defendant was properly served notice. I had this recently when I sued a company with 2 names; I was only able to get a ruling against one name because the person served at their office said she worked for Company A on both service forms (one for A and one for B). If the HOA no longer exists, it is impossible to serve, and therefore successfully sue them."
beamusing,"Why are the young families coming to you if they don’t want to listen to your advice?

The most motivating thing for me when I was younger was a visual representation of how different an investment will look if started at 20 vs 30 y.o., which illustrated precisely why waiting is a costly mistake.  "
beamusing,"You’re going to have a very tough time finding something that meets your criteria and allows you to metro.   Also depends on what you consider to be a “good” neighborhood.  I’d look around for potential short sales now, since those can take a while and that’s the only way you’re going to get something with a rentable basement in the 300s south of Gaithersburg.  Or really south of Ijamsville, which puts you outside of metro radius.  

Personal opinion: don’t overspend on the house.  You can always save the extra money and get a nicer one later and then this one becomes a rental property.  My guess is that rents in the DMV are just going to keep going up.  "
beamusing,"Do you have a personal goal of owning multiple rental properties?  If so, then I encourage you to explore the housing market in the area that you’re moving to, and maybe spend the first year saving up money to purchase a home that you could ultimately rent out.  

If that’s not your goal, then buying a house that you’re likely to sell before it’s appreciated enough to recoup the costs involved with buying and selling a house doesn’t make much sense financially.  "
beamusing,"Do you have a goal of buying and holding real estate as a rental investment? If not, it only makes sense to buy if you expect it to appreciate considerably over the next three years.   Since it was recently remodeled, it may be less likely to increase in value in relation to its surroundings. 

Also, when looking at condos, make sure to check the HOA fees.  Those aren’t always readily visible in listings and can add a lot of $$ to your monthly payment.  "
beamusing,"I actually read the whole thing, and it was pretty clear and very interesting!  Best if you summarize, though, I agree.  Start with the part about the numbers and then the advice you’re asking for. 

Im sorry you’re in this situation and I hope you’re reminding your dad how much you appreciate him.  He probably feels absolutely horrible.  "
beamusing,"Again, there is no reason you have to take on debt, unless you want to buy a house and don’t have the cash. 

That said, if you want to practice having debt and not freaking out about it, why not take out a smallish loan for something or put something on a card that you could actually cover with cash savings if necessary, and then when you get anxious about it you can remind yourself that you actually have the cash to cover it.  

E.g.  I use a credit card for most purchases to earn airlines points, but pay it off every month and always have enough cash that I could pay it off on the spot if necessary.  "
beamusing,"u/yes_its_him  makes a really good point.  Do some research for your area to figure out what the best rental property would be, keeping in mind that if you rent it out to college students in the future they might not go for a nice, update condo over affordability.  "
beamusing,"The link you posted says you have to have a qualifying child or dependent.  Are you saying your girlfriend is your dependent, and then she is claiming the child?

beamusing,"What is your income (ballpark), and what are your long-term financial goals?  Would you need to save up for a deposit when you move?

I would personally be very hesitant to deplete savings below a 3-6 month cushion, especially give the manageable costs of these loans.  If you had a sudden expense could you access cash again at that low rate?

I know others are all about being debt free, though, so I am curious to hear other perspectives!"
beamusing,"What is this fear stopping you from doing that’s important to you?

I agree with the others who say it’s not essential to take on debt.  The only really big ticket item I can think of that requires debt for most people would be a house..."
beamusing,"I know this isn’t exactly the type of advice you were looking for, but the first thoughts that come to mind:

How much is the car worth? Any chance you could trade it in for something older, thereby reducing the car debt?

Any chance of making extra money on the side through additional part-time work?"
beamusing,"Gotcha.  For some reason that wasn’t clear to me from the initial post as the reason to avoid the market, I assumed it was purely based on the timeframe.  I had good luck with C shares for my down-payment nest egg, but I started that in 2009.  Today’s is a very different market!"
beamusing,"The good news is, you’ve experienced both extremes: not making ends meet, and being financially savvy and financially comfortable.  Now you are asking yourself whether there’s a happy medium and how to cultivate the mental habits to get yourself to that place.  

Focusing on health as being of as much importance as money (so that you live to enjoy the fruits of all your labor) can help shift some of your very focused thinking onto activities that aren’t just about making money (e.g. getting back into working out).  

Right now you have one value guiding your actions: saving money.  Nothing wrong with that one and it’s helped you out so far.  You’re just wanting to add to the list so that you can focus on different values depending what you’re doing.  Suggestions include:

Health (as mentioned above)
Artistic expression (often part of a spiritual value for some people)
Spending quality time with family/loved ones

When you mentally elevate these values to the same level as the saving money value, then you can feel good about time spent in pursuit of each one, and simply shift your focus (obsession) onto the desired area at any given time.  You become obsessed with a balance or pursuits and then, ultimately, you can work on mental flexibility so you don’t feel “obsessed”.  By that time you’ll already be living a balanced life and it will be easier to make the shift to flexible thinking.  "
Insanereindeer,"FYI you can get a conventional loan with less than 20% that will allow PMI to fall off at 20% equity. FHA is for the life of the loan. Also PMI, while a burden, isn't the end of the world. For me it's $100 a month. Yes it would be nice to not have to pay it is what it is. Be aware, the sub is super conservative with home buying prices. You must analyze you finances individually and make your own judgement.

Insanereindeer,"Paint is HARD to match. I will say almost impossible, especially if it's red. Sun fade, age, etc makes it more than just slapping the same color on there. If the door has to be repainted, then as far as the rear door and front fender will have to be painted and faded so that the transitions between colors to match is less noticeable. They could also do this in one small area but it makes it very easy to tell. Sorry, that's just how it is. Honestly, if you dented my car that was perfect, I wouldn't accept touch up paint either because it almost always looks like complete trash. You can tell exactly where it was. Use your insurance. Let them handle it. "
Insanereindeer,Yes. Don’t tell them that. Either sit down and ask for a raise or find another company. Don’t tell them your interviewing else where. When you have an offer you can possibly see if they want to negotiate but be prepared to leave. 
Insanereindeer,"$1800 wasn’t mortgage but everything (insurance, PMI, mortgage, snd property tax).... What the heck? One person is going to use $100 a month in water? The bill for the FAMILY living there is currently $30. Your numbers are extremely off. No wonder this sub suggest only 3x mortgage for salary. Property taxes and insurance - $3600/year. It’s north Atlanta 40 miles OTP. Not downtown Manhattan.  I won’t purchase tv service. I did forget $65 for internet.  It’s a 280k house. Not 380k. 

My math as an engineer isn’t so bad that I expected my house payment and everything else to be $300....

I appreciate the attempt to help even though you numbers are crazy. I’m not paying 12k a year on taxes and insurance. "
Insanereindeer,"Is there some cost I am missing? I’ve already discussed with a lender for a 275k mortgage (approved for 400k which is ridiculous) and complete payment would be ~$1800. I feel comfortable making a payment on a house up to 300k I believe. Bills for everything house related is $250-$300. This leaves me approximately ~$2000/month after retirement and bills listed below.  I calculate take home after taxes and retirement can be maxed for the year. Obviously I need food so that’ll be another cost but since I’ve started working from home my food cost as decreased as I’ve learned to cook rather than eat out. I spent a good bit more in summer for gas on the boat. I understand the cost of house maintenance and possible major repairs such as HVAC and roofing. 

I’m currently putting away at a rate of ~35k/year so just buying in Q3/Q4 of 2019 would make a huge difference. Selling a toy isn’t really an option as they have hundreds of hours in them that couldn’t be replaced easily. I’d be up for selling the bike but it’s not worth much, ~$2500. 

I definitely feel like I’m missing something because it seems easily affordable. Not trying to fight your logic just trying to make sure I have 100% understand before I do something major. I’d love to find a 100k 2br/1ba 1200ft open style house for 100k, build me a big garage, and pay it off in 5 years but I’m not sure that’s a possibility. "
Insanereindeer,"I'd avoid used cars from stealerships. They're trying to make the most they can off what they have. Honestly, without the knowledge of vehicles and how they work, you really do just have to trust them. Before you buy a car, you should read some articles to know what to look for in a used vehicle. Whatever car you decide on, research their problems, expected life, major repairs, will it need a timing belt at 60 or 100k, etc? "
Insanereindeer,"Jeeps (actually Chrysler as a whole) are bad about having transmission problems which for replacement will be about the value of the car. That's 86,000 miles on rotors and brakes which last usually a maximum of 40,000 miles for most vehicles. They are fairly cheap to replace though if done yourself. Honestly, I'd avoid a Jeep.

&amp;#x200B;

I suggest you look at an older Toyota or Honda. These cars are reliable and generally will far outlive a Jeep. If looking for something like an SUV, a third gen Toyota 4runner is a great choice if you can find one in decent condition although you may have to spend closer to 4k to get one. That being said, I sold a great condition 4runner for $2500 a few years ago although it did need some minor things. "

poizster,Do you have Airbnb in your area? You could negotiate with an owner for an extended stay of 2-3 weeks. The rate will be significantly less than the daily rate and might be cheaper and a better situation for your family than an extended stay motel.

poizster,"Get out of Ameriprise as fast as you can and switch to Vanguard. Not only are their expense ratios ridiculous they also put you in loaded funds. The funds you're currently invested in likely have back-end load, meaning when you switch to Vanguard and want to sell them, there's going to be a fee when selling the shares. It's usually a percentage of the value in the fund, 1% is common. This fee goes back to Ameriprise, your financial advisor, or the fund itself.

Try to do an in kind transfer. This will transfer your mutual funds to Vanguard without liquidating them. When I switched to Vanguard from Ameriprise I was invested in 12 mutual funds. 11 of them were transferred in kind, but one, POSIX, had to be liquidated and then transferred as cash.

You can start the process of transferring your funds online or you can call Vanguard. I recommend calling because their website interface is not all that intuitive. They're customer service however, is excellent."
CarolSwanson,"“But not to fear, there may be a work-around for the work-around wrinkle.

The reason why most of Bentley’s Roth conversion will be taxable is that he has substantial money sitting in traditional IRAs, most of which has never been subject to income tax. But if Bentley’s employer 401(k) plan permits it, he can avoid tax liability on future conversions by rolling his current IRA balances over into the 401(k).

Not every employer plan allows this, but if Bentley’s will, he will be able to get around the pro-rata rules by effectively eliminating his current IRAs.”"
CarolSwanson,"Roommate late on rent- crazy story she told me My roommate paid the first two weeks rent for nov 15-30 and also gave me a check for December 1.  I deposited it and it bounced.  She said she had received inheritance from Korea and therefore there was a indefinite hold on her account.  She eventually paid me (very late) in cash and paid January on time in cash.

This month I asked for her check on Jan 30th so I could deposit it before I left on a flight. I returned and checked my account and it had bounced.  I had texted her that this time I couldn’t front her money again and maybe she could borrow from her parents or sister.  

She said she could pay me that night I discovered it and she handed me $268 (she owes me $1050 in total). 

She told me this story and how her uncle in Korea had been arrested for tax evasion and since he had been the executor of the will, because he had sent her and her sister and her parents and everyone checks from the inheritance now all their accounts were frozen.  

I basically said I thought this seemed far fetched and I’d never heard of innocent people’s accounts being frozen like that, and said that it’s not really my problem because we still owe the rent and I can’t be the one suffering because of her own problem.  I gave her till tomorrow to pay up and said that if she can’t afford the rent then she could move back in with her sister.

Thoughts? "
CarolSwanson,"Try paralegal positions at big firms. They pay good overtime. I paid off 75,000 this way.   Don’t pay attention to the people telling you to rely on loan forgiveness. You will needlessly limit your income instead of focusing on jumping to the highest paying jobs over the years. "
CarolSwanson,"I want to pay the taxes.  I want to move part of my old 401k funds pre-tax to after-tax.  Since I have a pre-tax IRA I was under the impression I can’t move any of my 401k into the same IRA, mixing pre and post.   Therefore I need to get all the funds out of the pre-tax IRA first.  "

CarolSwanson,I’m over the Roth Contribution limit and I want to roll part of my 401k into a Roth.  Because I have $70k in a pre-tax IRA I need to send that to my current 401k before I can do the Roth conversion.   My question is whether 401k plans allow that and it sounds like it depends on the administrator.  I don’t want to convert the entire $70k.  My q was answered by another poster... 
CarolSwanson,No I’m not confusing it.  I know all of this.  My only question is whether 401k plans allow you to roll a rollover IRA into them if it’s your current plan.  See my other answers.  You cannot just convert *part* of the traditional IRA into a Roth because of the pro rata rule.  Let’s say I want to convert 10k.  I would only want to have 10k in the traditional IRA before I do that.

\- Traditional IRA

\- Standard After-Tax investment account

hangster,"Yes we can afford it. It won't be a stretch but that is probably maximizing out excess. I agree, we haven't gotten to the part of what to do while it sits there. However, on the plus side there are family members around to help manage it."
hangster,"Yeah it seems like the best strategy is to take advantage a little bit every month or quarter or whatever makes you feel good - and just sell it out.  This could prevent the hated ""timing the market"" and getting a big bill when you exercise the whole set of options at once.

I'm supposed to get some dividends on my options that I've earned already - so I think I'll wait for that event, and then begin pulling it out. 

Thanks!

BTW I found this cool calculator - [https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator](https://smartasset.com/investing/capital-gains-tax-calculator)

It shows in my situation I could save 22% on the taxes of the excercise by waiting a year - but of course does not cover the risk question. It's interesting, but I think I know what to do now."
hangster,"Is it sound to buy a home for later life? Hi all-

My wife's and I recognize we are not going to live where are for very long. Way to expensive and not our favorite weather.

One of the places we are considering has some new homes being built - and they look nice and from what I can tell check everything on our list.

However, I wanted to hear what people thought about putting money down,  and taking on a mortgage while we still rent where we are today? Yes, we would vacation or take a nice weekend away at our home at least a few times a year if not more...

Does this make sense or should we wait to make the plunge on a home once we are ready to move?

Would love to hear this and reasoning here. 

Thanks for the input."
hangster,Your numbers are higher than reality... By a bunch but I agree on the point. The main benefit would be locking in a lower price compared to Future. And no need to pay for a hotel when we vigor the area which we do already. Of course one can never predict that is cheaper now vs later. It could be lower.
hangster,"Cashing out Stock Options - Long Term vs Short Term Hi all-

I'm looking to exercise some of my ISO stock options as I am getting too heavily invested in my company by just sitting on them.  However, I'm having a hard time figuring out the tax impact. 

Currently, I am in the 22% tax bracket - so I understand that if I take advantage of the options and buy them my income could potentially push me into the 24%(or higher if there was a lot of value) threshold. Honestly, not a big deal. 

And correct me if I'm wrong but if I buy &amp; hold, or buy &amp; sell my earnings would be considered short term earnings/income and taxed like that. Not much else to consider.

Now, if I have all of that correct - my other choice is I could buy &amp; hold onto the stocks for 1yr to reduce the taxes for a long term categorization. But this is where I don't see much value - I must be missing something. 
1. The difference between fair market price and my strike price is considered income and taxed. Could potentially move me up a bracket.
2. I wait 1yr and sell and IF the stock value increases the difference between the cost basis today and the sale price later results in income I would pay 20% tax short term gain tax on those earnings. 

If I have this all correct, I don't see much reason to put that much risk on these savings by waiting a year. Can anyone set me right and tell me how I'm wrong?

racejeff,"You must wait for the refund before filing amendments. Then if you file amendment and pay the extra tax can likely avoid interest and penalties assuming you file by April 15th. If you wait until they catch it you will risk being assessed interest and penalties.

In 2020 when they run the computer cross checks of 1099-INT the computer will catch it and send automated letter with change to return. . A simple amendment adding a missing 1099 or W2 is not going to effect audit risk when the computer check matches the return."
racejeff,Run now from EdwardJones and don’t look back. I had horrible experience with Edward Jones. I knew someone who became a broker there. I transferred a Roth and self directed Schwab cash investment account there were many good mutual funds I owned that were not eligible for the management program. One for example Fidelity ContraFund. I think many here would suggest Fidelity or Schwab. After my broker left no one ever contacted me. I transferred money back to Schwab. EJ has horrible back office operation and way to many lawyers requiring signatures. In order to get my business they discounted the management fee to 1.08% still higher than my other IRA management fees.
racejeff,"$120 is really cheap for professional preparer filing both federal and state. However if your situation is simple, tax software can handle easily. One concern I might have about your ability to do it is that number of kids is not a measure of complexity. Are the kids yours and you wife’s? Is there another ex that might have dependent rights etc. Are there education or dependent care credits? Those are all complexity. Based on what you told us no one can know if you could do your own. I used to tell people who wanted to do their own they should come see me very 3 years, if they were making a mistake we could fix with an amended return. —- Other side $120 is really cheap for marital peace if the preparer is good."
racejeff,It’s probably legit. You should have gotten a 1098 T form from your university. It shows how much you spent and the type of student you were. If you spent more than 4000 you qualified for a 2500 tax credit. With 40% of that or 1000 being refundable if you didn’t owe any taxes. The 60% would offset taxes owed. Used to be called American Opportunity Credit but the new tax laws may have changed some of that.
racejeff,"Free answers on internet may be worth what you pay for it. For $420 you can get a professional to do the return. There are conditions where you could claim a girlfriend as dependent, however that only gets the dependency. Girlfriend would not qualify you for HOH

Basically it depends on how long she lived with you and her income amount.

Given what you described you in the past you could claim as dependent. But I’m not current on 2018 rules. Her dependent does not effect HOH status if you have qualifying children."
racejeff,"You can claim her as dependent and not be HOH, ie single .

From what you said you can claim her but be warned I quit doing taxes last year. I doubt that changed but if it did I wouldn’t know."

racejeff,If she wants to move to another financial institution she can do a direct rollover with no tax or penalty. That is the one bank transfers to the new one directly. Normally the new one can make those arrangements. If you do the transfer without being direct you have a limited time to redeposit the IRA to avoid taxes. I believe 60 days. And theoretically the currently holding bank will withhold potential taxes. But I really never saw any institution do that. Direct is easier and safer. Talk to the new institution.
racejeff,File your personal taxes on a 1040 MFJ. The LLC should issue a K1 which will then give amounts to go on the 1040. K1 should have instructions about how the numbers transfer. I assume the accounts you mentioned are for the LLC. LLC could opt to file as either a corporation or partnership. My answer assumes filing as partnership.
racejeff,"The correct IRS term for your spouse is non-resident alien (NRA). You can either file a W-7 form to get your spouse an ITIN . To e-file any status an ITIN is needed. Your possible status are MFJ , MFS or if you have qualifying dependent children HOH. You can not file single. I did find a 5 year old Turbo Tax article indicating you could file paper return as MFS with NRA in the SSN / ITIN field. No idea if that is still allowed. MFS May cost you several tax credits and will cost a higher tax rates.  You probably need a tax professional and really pay someone. This is complicated. Not worth the risk of trying to be free.

And just to be clear. If you are married you cannot file as Single. "
racejeff,There really aren’t any legal requirements on w4. You just want to make sure you withhold enough not to get penalties. I often suggest if there are multiple jobs pick a primary job/ source and do it for what it the situation and for all other jobs second jobs or spousal jobs do single with 0. Due to the way employer with holding works each job assumes it is only job on tax return.
racejeff,"Sounds like at least  one of you owe student loans. There are a few things they will retain your tax refund to pay off. Things like past due student loan debt, back taxes and back child support and a couple others if your state submits info. If you filed jointly and only one of you owed one of those things there is an injured spouse filing that will protect the refund of the other person. You might want to look into filing that form. 

Also to be technically correct a tax return is the information you file with the IRS ie a 1040. A tax refund is the money they send back to you. They withheld your tax refund."
racejeff,Sorry for your loss. For at least the last decade and maybe last 20 years IRAs management companies have made strong effort to have designated beneficiaries named. If their is one the account will pass to them directly retaining its characteristics of that IRA. Should check to see if one is named. Assuming you have the legal rights.
racejeff,"Box 7 goes by to a schedule C and yes you pay self employment tax. There is the possibility of an exception to that if it was a temporary thing that won’t be repeated.

DrDH21,"What to do with TSP I currently have about 35k sitting in a TSP and have been separated from the VA system for about 2 years. I am not yet maxing out my 403b that I have through my current position, but will be as soon as some debt is paid off. Once this occurs and I am able to max out my 403b, what do I do with my TSP? My ultimate goal is to return to the VA system but who knows if that will be the case. 

Do I (or can I, even) roll this TSP money into an IRA and then contribute to it going forward? Or leave it in the TSP to take advantage of the low fees and the thought that I'll eventually get back into the VA and start contributing to it again. If I do roll it into an IRA, can I roll it back to the TSP if I re-enter the VA? Thoughts? "

DrDH21,"Planning for Retirement I recently began to take retirement seriously. Prior to this, I would put in my 5%, max out employee match, and leave it alone without much thought to it. I switched jobs about 2 years ago (was at VA so had a TSP) and in my current job I have 2 accounts. One is only my contributions, which is $9750/yr. The other is from my university and this fluctuates from year to year...probably about 9-12k yearly. Both accounts are through Fidelity and set up on 2045 R6. Bit of a background, I was in college/grad school/residency/fellowship until 2013 when I was 31 years old (now 36) so I am late to the game.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm essentially trying to understand the singular or combined effects of market growth and dividends. I noticed over the past 2 years that dividends paid into each of my Fidelity accounts at 4.926% at the end of the calendar year. This amount was reinvested. TSP does not show any dividends (that I can find anyway).

&amp;#x200B;

Assuming an average of 6% yearly gain on investment growth over the course of these accounts, is it (somewhat) safe/reasonable to assume that I can expect this gain plus reinvested dividends yearly? So 10-11% compounded ROI yearly between the two? This would be independent of monthly contributions. This seems too good to be true, so I'm sure it's not. Could someone help me understand if I am correct with this assumption and ELI5 if it's not? Also, regarding dividends, do these remain stable yearly? They were the same percentage in 2017 and 2018. If they don't stay the same each year, is there any rhyme or reason for how they change yearly? Or just depends on investments and market? Does anyone out there know if TSP works with dividends as well?

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks all!"
DrDH21,"Are my 403b and 401a contributions adequate? I am employed at an academic medical center with two salary sources. One from professorship, one from patient/insurance revenue. Total salary fluctuates year to year, but tends to hover around 150-160k. My professorship salary is 65k and my patient revenue is about 85-95k.  I have a 403B and a 401A account through my university. My 403B is entirely voluntary from my base salary and my 401A is entirely from my university through my base salary and patient/insurance revenue. There is no ""match"" per se, as these are different accounts.

&amp;#x200B;

403B: I put in 15% pretax of my professorship (65k) salary, which is $9750 a year. 

401A: Two sources of contribution. (1) University contributes 9% of professorship salary, so $5850/yr. (2) After I top 40k collections, my university then contributes an additional 9% to collections. This ranges from 4k-5k/yr. Total 401A a year is around 10k from university only. 

&amp;#x200B;

So this is a total of about 19-20k yearly, or around 13% of my total salary (albeit in separate accounts). I can't change the 401A contributions, but can alter the 403B contributions as needed. Am I contributing enough to my 403B at 15% ($9750/yr) or should I work to increase this? I'm not comfortable maxing anything out anytime soon (would have to put 29% of my base pay to 403b) due to my pay structure and variable income from collections. I can, however, increase it a bit for now if needed then more in future. I feel like this is adequate but just making sure. For context, I am 36 and didn't start contributing to retirement until age 31 (TSP at that time) due to school/residency."
DrDH21,"If you leave them grouped your minimum payment goes to the interest only of the group of loans. Student loans have a rule that you can't pay principal on ANY of the loans within a group until you pay off the interest of the ENTIRE group first.

Okay that was my understanding of it from what the loan officer said. She said it’d be better to pay each loan in full one by one, because if we just paid one sum to all loans then it would just hit interest of them all. She said we could not choose  one loan to pay off through payments, it was either one payment to the group or one each loan in full.

If we ungroup them, do you know if it would be possible to choose one to pay off with monthly payments?"
DrDH21,"10-15 year investment - FSKAX v. FSCSX I'm looking into making a 10-15 year investment and have recently been researching Fidelity funds. I have come across two that I've been looking into, FSKAX and FSCSX. I have several retirement accounts through Fidelity but am otherwise fairly new to the personal investing scene. In comparing these two funds, FSCSX seems to have a bit better long-term growth record (I know that past doesn't predict future here) but has a higher expense ratio (0.73% vs 0.015%), higher turnover rate (28% vs 5%), and slightly higher volatility and risk. My understanding is that the higher expense ratio would eat away at some growth through fees and that a higher turnover rate could generate some capital gains taxation. It would likely be the case that the initial entry to the fund would be around 500-1000 with about a 100 or so put in each month going forward.

In this context, are these fees and turnover rates really something to consider heavily when deciding between the two here? Or are they largely negligible differences with the amount I'll be putting in and potential growth trajectory?

Also, does anyone out there have any pros/cons for each of these funds?"
DrDH21,I would love to retire by 60-62. I do have a TSP that has about 35k in it from when I worked for a VAMC. I am leaving that in there in case I ever go back that route. I will have a bit of a pension from the VA but not much to write home about since I was only there just under 4 years.
DrDH21,"&gt;This is the devil in the details for those that look at the salary of healthcare professionals with envy.  Often, they are not starting contributions until their 30s

Yea this is my thought process right now. The contributions are good; however, the late start leaves me a bit uneasy about not putting in more whenever possible and increasing the contribution. 15% overall would require about 20% on my part, so an additional 5%. Not terrible at all and probably something I can work up to over the course of this year."

savvysims,Yeah and I understand why because I had no credit at the time but needed a dependable car to travel to work and training. I’m only 22 now. This is the only outstanding debt I have. Is there penalties for paying off certain loans faster? 
savvysims,"Refinance questions I bought a used 2015 Jetta about two years ago. Great condition. Since then I was in a wreck (not at fault. Tractor trailer backed over me, yikes) and the car sustained some front end damage. I’ve been told by my bank that there isn’t enough value in the car for them to refinance for me. It’s been a great car but I don’t want to get too underwater too fast at this point. It was my first car purchase and my dad co-signed. The interest is between 8-9%. I don’t have the exact figure in front of me but I can provide if necessary. What are your thoughts? 4y 1 month left on loan $236 monthly"
savvysims,"I guess it’s not really temporary when you put it that way. I meant it in like we will be buying a home in that frame. I should have elaborated. 

I’m asking generally here for advice. I’m in the early stages of looking as well. I’m looking and have seen pet friendly apartments. Some with limits some with nothing written in the advertisement. I have never moved with a dog on my own (lived with parents and was a child then). The cats have been easy. "
savvysims,"So that’s about $225 a month before interest. If someone else could chime in with the interest calculation that would be appreciated.

So, this is what I would do. Stop using the UVER card and leave the balance at zero. It’s one less payment coming out of your next check. Yeah, it probably means going without some extra things for awhile but it also means you’re paying your bill down. Always pay more than the minimum. I usually pay twice the minimum as a rule if I have to pay on it awhile. "
savvysims,"Yeah it’s definitely been repaired. The tractor trailer backed over the whole front end of the car crushing the radiator and all. 
Yeah it took about 3,000 off the car instantly. This I have a 3,000 + deficit on the value and the loan. I saw plus because of the accident and normal depreciation. "

Nagisan,"Ah, that makes sense....I'm dumping it all into TSP and even without my debt payments I can only just barely hit the yearly cap so paying off the debt first lets me start hitting that cap earlier instead of just dumping a little more yearly into it than I am with my loan payments.  

Are you able to hit the caps and still have enough left over to pay extra on your loans? Either way paying off debt earlier is better than delaying it, but if your retirement accounts are going to grow faster than refinanced loans build interest than that would be the better option."
Nagisan,"Do you have a goal on your savings? If not it might be worth making one then moving that $1k monthly to your loans once you reach it.  

I personally have about 3mo of emergency savings (minimum monthly bills) but a stable paycheck (military) for the next few years. I'd like to have more, however with my situation it is more beneficial to get my loans knocked out of the way first.

EDIT: Also a good savings account is going to be ~2-2.5% interest, you'd ""make"" far more paying off any loans you have above that rate than you would by just keeping it in savings. But you should still have a strong emergency savings just in case."
Nagisan,"Yes, here's some additional info on amending returns from the IRS website: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/file-form-1040x-to-amend-a-tax-return  

So you'll wait until you get your refund (and cash it....don't send the refund back to them), then send the 1040X and pay back any amount you owe."
Nagisan,"If the 0% stays for the full 60 months and you want to maximize your profits, pay the minimums and invest the rest, then pay the loan off out of the invested money in the last month of 0% interest.  

Alternatively if you want to think less about it, calculate the monthly payment necessary to pay off the loan at 60 months, pay that amount, then do what you want with the rest.  

EDIT: Paying off 0% interest 42 months early means you are missing out on 42 months of potential interest from investing that money."
Nagisan,Pretty sure if the other driver is at fault than their insurance covers your bills. If they don't have enough to cover your bills than your insurance covers what theirs doesn't (and your insurance can also go after their insurance for more money). But I've never worked for an insurance company so I'm just going off personal experiences.
Nagisan,"Tax laws changed. Without knowing how you're filing (single, married, etc) and your tax situation (total income, any additional credits and what not), nobody can tell you exactly why you owe.  

Could be that your income pushed you out of a few credits you were able to claim last year, or a number of other things."
Nagisan,"If you don't have to pay rent on a 50k salary then you can definitely afford the car, a 15k loan for 4 years on a 5% interest is going to be about $350/mo. Much cheaper than rent would be (which you aren't paying), and people deal with rent + car payments on lower income all the time.  

The question of whether you should is on you. Things will happen that you can't predict, you may have to start paying rent before you pay the car off, etc.  

EDIT: Also, age of credit is factored into credit score, with only 4 years of average credit age you have 760 which is quite good. You should have no problems getting a low rate on your auto loan."
Nagisan,"You are safe to go ahead and deposit the refund, the 1040X will give you another separate refund if necessary (if the IRS owes you), or you will need to pay back the IRS some amount (if you owe the IRS). Paying them back can be either a check mailed with your 1040X, or you can pay online."
Nagisan,"I would say housing expenses as a whole (utilities and all) is commonly around 30% of take home income. Rent alone should be more around 20-25%.  

Depends heavily on the area though, I'm not in a HCOL area, but the absolute cheapest places I can find nearby are about 25% of my take home. They tend to be in crappier areas further away from work, the extra gas alone would easily add $50 to my monthly expenditure. Instead I'm paying about 30% of take home to live close to work and other necessities and in a safer area.  

EDIT: To OP, 1/3rd is way too much for groceries and other shopping expenses unless you're making a really low income. Assuming you do your own cooking you can get by pretty decently on $200-300 (depends on if you bargain shop or not, and whether you're in a HCOL area or not) for food per month. Knowing your monthly take home and area would give us a better idea on how much you can afford."
Nagisan,"&gt; the rule of thumb is to invest 15% of your gross pay to retirement. that should be pretty easy to do since you're going to be eating at the chow hall more than not.

I would say invest as much as you can while you have little to no bills. I know airmen who were putting 50% into TSP in tech school cause they had no debt. TSP is one of the better options for retirement accounts so you may as well make use of it while you can."
Nagisan,"IIRC the limit to automatically trigger something is $10,000....anything under that should be fine.  

EDIT: Yes, it's $10,000+ that needs reported. Anything under is only reported if the bank believes the amount was chosen to avoid the $10,000 limit. So if you deposit $9,000 then another deposit of like $2,000 or something, it will probably be reported."
Nagisan,"I'll have to check TT later, I manually did the math based off my W-2 (which wouldn't have my loan deduction), probably wrong as I'm likely missing something but it should be pretty close.

EDIT: Actually I forgot about some additional non-taxable income I received last year....

Based on only AGI my effective rate was: 4.4%  
Based on all income (AGI + nontaxable): 2.4%"
Nagisan,"While accurate, depending on how much interest he currently owes paying extra could pay down that interest. Chances are unless he has pretty low interest rates on his loans, paying that extra $1200 now will save more money than he'd make by investing that $1200 though, even if it doesn't affect his taxes."
Nagisan,"Did your insurance plan not cover rental? Most of them do unless you choose not to take it.  

Typically in this scenario, as you expected, you are on the hook to pay off the loan. The insurance will pay the amount they value your car at directly to the lien holder and any remaining balance is still a loan in your name. If you had anything done to the car to increase its value (new tires, additional options installed, etc), be sure you provide those receipts to your insurance company and you can negotiate your cars value.  

The value they provide for your old car though has nothing to do with the rental, that's a separate part of your policy and is definitely something you should have. Unfortunately many people go with the bare minimums on everything and don't have an emergency savings, then when something like this happens they're kinda SOL.  

You could possibly go after the other driver to cover more but I'm not entirely sure how that process works."
Nagisan,"Usually consolidation is used to reduce the number of places your paying and either lower monthly payments, lower interest rates, or a combination of those. It does this by extending the time you have to pay back the amount your currently owe...so if you had say 5 years left, they might do a 10 or 15 year loan with a lower rate, which would also be significantly lower payments.  

That being said I've never dealt with consolidation myself so definitely ask for additional opinions."
Nagisan,"You also chose to privately settle the matter. Part of that is risking them flaking on you. When you just ""shake hands"" and say ""lets not involve insurance"", there is no binding contract that forces him to stick around and work with you. He may be the one refusing to stand by his word, but you accepted that the moment you chose not to involve insurance.  

It may not be too late to file a claim with your insurance. You probably shouldn't go straight after his insurance but instead file it with your own and give them all the info you have on the person. They can figure out his insurer."
Nagisan,"0.75% is extremely low interest if you're correct (I suspect you might mean 7.5%?). If 0.75% is accurate, you will honestly make more money off your savings (if you have it in a good savings account) or good investments.  

That being said, I do not recommend dumping your savings to mostly pay off your loan. Figure out your monthly expenses (rent, food, utilities, internet, phone, minimum loan payment, insurance, etc). Find out the minimum amount you have to pay in a month, keep 3x that in your savings (3mo worth of bills in savings) as your emergency fund. Anything over can go towards your loan and completely stop saving until you pay off your loan.  

If your loan really is 0.75%, pay the minimums until it's paid off and invest or put the extra into a high yield savings account, your dividends/interest earned will be higher than the interest accrued on your loan.  

EDIT: Here's what I'd do:

* 0.75% interest - Minimum payments on your loan, the rest into a high yield savings account (2%+) or TSP.
* 7.5% interest - Find out my 3mo minimum bills for an emergency fund, spend anything above that in my savings on my loan, reduce monthly savings allotment to $0 and TSP to 5% (assuming you are getting matching through the BRS) until loan is paid off, paying the difference towards the loan each month."
Nagisan,"""Restricted to joint filers"" means ""Not available for your situation"".  

All that happened is, due to your situation, the IRS said ""Sorry, we can't give you a larger refund because you are no longer eligible for some of the benefits you were previously."", they are not saying ""Sorry, you got married so we're going to keep more of your tax.""  

A penalty implies they are charging you more because you got married, you got married which changed your tax situation, which is what caused you to not be eligible for one specific benefit."
Nagisan,"Washer/dryer is a godsend, that was another reason I chose to spend a bit more....many places out here (cheaper than mine) don't have washer/driers....or have hookups but appliances not included. I probably won't be here more than a few years so buying my own wouldn't really be worth it, but not having to run to a laundry mat, even just once a week (single, no kids), is worth the premium.  

Doing the math I'm paying about 26% of my gross pay (about 30% of my net pay) in rent + basic utilities (gas/water/trash/electric)...it could be lower, but I like the area, it's a nice apartment (brand new, built less than 3 years ago), has all the conveniences I need, etc. I could definitely save more on a cheaper place but I'm not hurting for money living here and I'm happier here than another place.

Sounds like your rent might be a little more than the 26% I'm paying (mine is with utilities, sounds like your amount is 26% without utilities), but if you're happy with the place and think it will provide a better environment for your child than other places, than it's worth it."
Nagisan,"EDIT: This only applies if you owe additional interest on your loans that is not paid off monthly with your minimum payments.  

You're not losing money, that money went towards lowering your debt (which increases your net worth).  

Two situations:

- You pay an extra $1200 in loan interest to take the max deduction, as a result you get maybe $150 extra on your refund (depends on your tax bracket). Your net worth increases by $150 (your debt is lowered by $1200 but that money was presumably in your checking already).  
 
-OR-  

- You put $1200 in your savings and DO NOT get any extra tax refund. Your net worth increases by $0 (your debt isn't lowered, the $1200 was already factored into your net worth since it's in your checking already, but you didn't get a bigger tax refund).  


So if you spend the $1200 on your loans, you see less money in your checking account but your debt is also smaller (so it's just a transfer from your checking to your loans), and you get a bigger refund. If you don't spend the $1200 on your loans (lets say you leave it in checking), you see more money in your account but you still owe more on your loans ($1200 more to be exact), you get a smaller refund (than if you paid more, assuming you're not hitting the cap already).  

In the above situation, it's either increase your net worth by $150 because you lowered your debt by $1200, or don't increase your net worth at all because you wanted to see bigger numbers in your checking account."
Nagisan,"They already offered 100k base, the worst they can do if you ask for more is say ""Sorry, 100k is the most we can do"". Counter-offer with something over 100k and they will either meet somewhere in the middle and you'll make more, or they'll leave it at 100k and you can happily accept that."
Nagisan,"Something between the two is different. They follow the same rules (calculations), they don't just magically have different numbers.  

If there is a difference, you need to view the actual 1040's and everything like Fin-Tech suggested and go through them. You will see a difference and hopefully be able to understand what you entered wrong."
Nagisan,"Mathematically speaking paying off the higher interest loans first will always save you more money regardless of the amount of loans. You will either pay $10k @ 6.8% off in 4 years while paying larger amounts on the $15k @ 6.6% (soon to be $60k), or you will pay the $10k @ 6.8% off now, trading 4 years of 6.8% interest for 4 years of 6.6% interest.

You either pay 6.8% for the next 4 years plus 6.6% for the next 9ish years (averages to about 6.66% over 13 years), or pay 6.6% for the next 13 years."
Nagisan,"As long as you have an emergency savings equal to a few months of bills, any additional savings (for big purchases/vacations/etc) is completely up to you. If making big purchases or going on vacation is worth paying more interest to you, than it's worth saving for otherwise it's better to pay the loans down as quickly as possible."
Nagisan,"I did something similar, didn't consider adding dividends to income. Got a statement a few days ago about dividends earned (which I'd NEVER seen before from my bank, guess it was over some minimum limit or something).  

As others said just wait and file an amendment. I already got my refund, tried filing an amendment and it said the form wouldn't be ready till 15 Feb or something."
Nagisan,"Yes.  

What you should do if you want to milk out as much as possible is come up with a plan to pay off the debt as closely to the end of its 0% interest as possible, which is probably minimum payments until then with enough cash saved up to pay if off in full.  

You could take the easy route and get a high-yield savings account (2-2.45% interest), or you can go the investment route if you're open to more risk.  

Assuming you had 45k right now, you can throw that into a high-yield savings and bank the interest, then pay off the rest of your debt when you get close to the end of the 0% interest rate. Alternatively you can calculate how much you will owe by then, put that amount in a high-yield savings and invest the rest. That would probably be your best option while avoid the most risk (if you invest it all, there's the possibility the market could shift and you could be under $45k by the time you have to pay off your loans, putting the amount necessary in a savings first avoids his but gives lower potential returns)."
Nagisan,"I'm not sure, you didn't earn income while in MD because, whether you were a resident or just living with your BF, you earned the income while still living in CT.  

It sounds like your employer screwed up, I'd contact them and ask why they withheld tax for MD while you were living in CT and see what they say. It sounds like what you would want to do is get all the tax back from MD (which means you might have to file something, not sure if you would need to do a standard return of some kind or not) and instead report that as income while living in CT (like you did by adding the income to your CT part year resident income) You should be filing a CT part year Resident return, and anything else necessary to get money back from MD. You shouldn't be filing a CT non-resident return at all (not just entering $0 as income, like the form shouldn't even be there), which may be causing that error message to appear."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Thanks for the article! I had confused the inverse relation of bonds and interest rates with an inverse relationship between bonds and stocks! I'll also review the content I consumed to review that data and hopefully better understand the intended meaning being that content.

The flow chart is actually what started this whole conversation and move to plan for the future.

Thank you again for your patience. We both appreciate it very much. He's really impressed with this sub and asking questions like why people even bother to help, lol."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Investing with my Roth IRA, need a bit of handholding to make sure I'm not screwing things up. When I first opened a Roth IRA account with Vanguard, the money automatically went under Federal Money Market (Settlement find) VMFXX.

This is probably a stupid question: my account will still be a Roth IRA account when I exchange VMFXX for the mutual fund of my choice, right?

I want to put that money into a different Vanguard mutual fund, but I find the the Vanguard interface to be a little confusing, so I'm worried I'm trying to do something stupid. So, could someone just help make sure I'm not shooting myself in the foot?

My input into Vanguard's interface:
1) Where is the money going? I picked my mutual fund of choice.
2) Where's the money coming from? I selected my Roth IRA and entered an amount.

Is this right?

Edit: Seems I'll be okay to move forward as described above."
shin-ramyun-eater,Does it give me any advantage to max out my 401k as quickly as I can though? It makes sense to me because the untaxed porting of it gets invested sooner than later. I guess I'm looking for a sanity check to see whether that make sense.
shin-ramyun-eater,"Debt first, otherwise you have this other giant thing costing you interest. Having a house is great, but it's also a lot of work. And unless you're planning to monetize the house, you're only adding to your own expenses in the form of insurance, interest, property tax, etc.

It sounds like if you guys stay on your current budget, and without the student loans + interest, you'll be able to save up to 20% soon enough."
shin-ramyun-eater,"I think another way to look at it is that if something goes badly in life, your investment portfolio might go away, but your loans won't, and they might even get worse. But if you pay off your debt, and things take a sour turn, well, at least you're not starting at a low point with the weight of student loans on your back."
shin-ramyun-eater,"I was under the impression that bonds and stocks move conversely to each other. Am I mistaken? (This thread has been teaching us a lot and dispelling a lot of my misconceptions.)

He is indeed in a bond fund, and while the fund is diverse (us total bonds) the risks are not. Is that a correct statement/use of terminology?

We've been discussing it and he said it seems to make sense that nursing home costs are usually monthly, not in lump sums. Since he's worried, i suggested to add an Emergency travel and Family emergency budget on top of his 6-month emergency budget, and then worked out the rest of his expenses VS income. We're seeing that on top of all that, he can maintain his current lifestyle and still contribute 15% to his 403b, max out his Roth IRA, setup an HSA, while still coming out on top. He says seeing all written out is really helping him get the feeling he doesn't have to be scared to spend a little more money for a little TLC to himself.

Edit: although he said he'd likely still save it but I think that's great lol."
shin-ramyun-eater,"In my opinion, it's a bad idea to go back to college because you're unsure of what to do and skeptical of what you're able to achieve.

With whatever field you're interested in, start gaining experience there via internships (hopefully paid, or intern PT and work PT/FT), or self-study and apply for entry level positions. When looking up entry level positions, don't get discouraged by the job requirements. Apply if you're at least 60% confident, and if you're not, use the job requirements as a study checklist. You'll have to work hard and learn on the job  if you get a job at 60% qualification, but it's hardly impossible. When you get your post-college sea legs under you, then you can work towards going back for a masters is you still want.

After I graduated I really wasn't sure what to do with a similar degree to what you have. Everyone told me similar to what I wrote above, and man am I grateful they did. I love my field, I'm learning and getting paid, so a master's isn't so important to me now. That said, I'd like to start a business one day. At that time, I may consider going back to school.

Edit: I did not go into a field relevant to my study, but I sure do apply the knowledge in what I do now. My study doesn't directly inform my current job responsibilities, but it does inform other parts of life, and all of it together is what brings me to a very fortunately position now."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Because I want to make sure it makes sense and adds value to my investment is why :)

I'm in my 30s and I'm just getting started, so I feel a little late to the game as I should've done something about it 3 years ago."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Hey that's a lot of stress, and $60k is no small number, but at 24 you can still rebound. Don't try to run away and ignore it, because everything you build later might get swept away when it all catches up to you, and that would be even more tragic.

You're also supporting an extra person with your bf being unemployed. If possible it'd be great for him to hold even a minimum wage job to help contribute. Otherwise you can only accept that you're willing to carry his burden on top of your own and move on to other parts. Just be sure his behavior isn't making it worse for your debt though."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Does it make sense to max out 401k ASAP given extra cash lying around after Roth, HSA, and emergency fund? I was just thinking it would allow my contributions to be invested sooner than later. I have some extra money after maxing our 2019 Ira. HSA is on course to maxing out. No plans for any large purchases any time soon. I could live off the extra cash while contributing, say, 50% to 401k. Thoughts?"
shin-ramyun-eater,"I didn't even think of it that way, and that's a really good point. I'm saving on the difference of taxed dollars, but that could cost me if I lump sum, where I might have to time the market (which I'd be terrible at). Where as dollar cost averaging it out would give me better odds on an over all average cost.

I'll keep this in mind. Thanks!"
shin-ramyun-eater,"I see. Regarding my statement about 75/25 split being conservative, that's backed by my inexperience and lack of knowledge, so it may be entirely inaccurate and I think entirely valid for me to called out on. That said, for education purposes, what might be considered conservative?"
shin-ramyun-eater,"I agree. Unless she's planning to take legal action (and bare those costs), your family should look forward and while things will be tough, but things tend to work out for the better when you remove toxic elements from your life. More importantly, be there for your mom. She may need a shoulder to cry on, or simply someone to help her get some housekeeping work done. If all she needs to do is focus on her career, it helps to have the rest of her daily life taken care of. Hang out with your mom sometime. Treat her to something nice. Everyone appreciates being appreciated, and it would mean a lot to her in such stressful times.

Aside from that,'I think you're already doing an incredible amount. Good on you."
shin-ramyun-eater,"And definitely don't put it on your student loans. I have so many peers who lived in nicer apartments and had full entertainment systems while on student loans, only to be plagued by those expenses after graduating. That said, you're young, do you young thing.just make sure Yolo isn't the last thing you say."
shin-ramyun-eater,"I hadn't realize this should be a concern for employers, but it also kind of makes sense since they'd have to pay a bigger chunk of money over a shorter period of time. I'll keep this in mind, thank you."
shin-ramyun-eater,"I'd reconsider selling your car and buying a new one.
You might not be able to sell it at it's valued price, there will be taxes involved and unexpected fixes that'll need to happen with purchasing a car. Your current car registration will have become wasted money, and you'll have to pay for a new car registration. At that price difference I'd rather have something reliable. At lease you can sleep in a reliable car.

There are many services on campus. Seek those out and see what access you have as a student. Back in college, there were a number of students that would camp in the nearby mountains (usually full of people anyway, also relatively safe community), and the shower on campus and use WiFi in the library till closing time (midnight). They did this until it got too cold. Now, I'm in no way suggesting you do this, I'm just trying you can do a lot of you're resourceful."
shin-ramyun-eater,"With interest rates trending up, does that mean he should at least not be 100% in bonds? I'd personally opt for at least 75% stocks 25% bonds (per Graham), which I consider relatively conservative. He says he has no idea what to do but is open to learn."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Thank you for the thorough explanation. I was under the misconception that going all bonds would be risky in that there's little diversification as well as being concerned with the interest rate trending up.

He's 36 with more than a year's salary saved in cash.  We recently figured is emergency fund is about $6,500 for 6 months, so even at 12 months it's be $13,000. He mentioned he worries about his grandparents having to go to a nursing home, and that would create a financial burden for his parents, and he'd be willing to contribute as much as necessary to ease their stresses, hence why such liquidity."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Friend has 100% in bonds because ""it's the safest... right?"" Edit for context: this is a question we're asking together for our education. I'm not here to tell people what to do with their money. This post is reviewed and okayed by my friend. He also wants to learn, he just doesn't use Reddit.

Hi, my friend has been looking into investing a large sum of his money into an index fund, but when he set up his account he wasn't really sure what he was doing so he chose all bonds under the impression that bonds meant safe.

That seemed alarming to me because for one, that's a lot of eggs in one basket, and for another, interest rates are more likely to go up instead of down. He's now seeing some depreciation, so he asked me what to do, and while I know what I would do, I feel too inexperienced to tell him what to do. So I said I'd ask here, where people have been great in giving advice and perspective while leaving the decision up to OP.

He
- has emergency fund put aside
- has started and funded a Roth IRA, split between total US, Int'l, and US bonds (I helped set this up).
- has a 403b (doesn't plan to put any more money in 403b since company already offers to contribute x% of paycheck)

If I were him...

-  I would cut my losses since he's concerned about being down $200 on a $30k account, and interest rates seem more like they'd go up instead of down. For the safest option I'd put that money in a high interest savings account like Ally or CIT or a CD account.
- I would personally start an HSA account if my workplace offered it.
- I would consider maxing out the 403b but he's worried about large costs and having money tied up in retirement. To do so, I would set contributions to max out and use current savings to make up the difference if it exists.

I know he doesn't have any large purchases but is very insecure of not having immediate cash available (hence why he had up to $60k sitting in a checkings account at one point on a $50k/year salary).

In conclusion, he's got $30k sitting all in bonds, he's worried about depreciation of those bonds, but he also wants to be safe and let his money grow more than inflation. What would you guys do, for reference?"
shin-ramyun-eater,"Hey I'm in a very similar boat. I started looking into it about 5 months ago so I haven't seen the results, but I'll share what I've learned and am working on:


Roth IRA - taxed now, all the money and it's growth will be tax free upon retirement. Great for young people, we still qualify. 2018 contribution limit is $5,500, you can still contribute to it through April 15, 2019. You can also begin contributing to 2019. Roth IRA have income limits ($135,000 single, 199,000 married filing jointly), in which case look into a Backdoor IRA (legal, and not as bad as it sounds).

I created my Roth IRA account in Vanguard and transferred money over. Now I'm selecting funds and ETFs to to diversify so that I'm covering US stocks, international stocks, and US bonds. I'm putting in minimum required for each investment, and then will dollar-cost average the rest over the next few months.

401k - set to max out since it's tax free, so you have more even more money to invest with on top of company matching.

HSA if you have access to one. Mine is also set to max out because it's tax free like a 401k, but still available to use towards medical costs tax-free. My 401k is in a Vanguard retirement fund (2055 I think)

You can also consider a 509 plan to save towards tuition and education costs (it can even be used for you!). I haven't looked into this one as much.

I still need to put my emergency fund into Ally, which you're already doing (nice!). Outside of that I still have a bit to invest more aggressively. As I understand it, the typical rule of thumb is 100-age, currently that means I should be investing about 30% bonds and 70% stocks (via funds and ETFs), but since I came later to this game, with everything else being safely allocated, I'm planning to invest more aggressively and be closer to 85/15 (still exercising diversification) with the remaining amount since I'm not planning on any large purchases for the next few years.

Outside of that, I have a mortgage, but no loans. So it seems I can still live a comfortable, frugal life, and even  save towards an annual vacation budget.

Edit:: also, I was super scared to mess everything up with a mouse click, so I explained every action I was taking here and someone walked me through it here.

Edit2:: my understanding in the order of operation:
1) establish emergency fund and out into a high-interest account (which you are)
2) contribute up to employer match on 401k
3) max out Roth IRA for 2018 &amp; 2019
4) max out HSA if you can
5) finally go back to maxing out 401k
6) tell me when you find out what to do next...."
shin-ramyun-eater,"I maxed out my Roth IRA in December 2018, when can I put more money in to hit 2019 limits? I read somewhere it gets pretty if you over-contribute so I'm hesitant to put in more money. Can I put more money in now that it's 2019, or do I need to wait until after tax day?

Answer: I could have contributed Jan 1, 2019 if I specified the contribution was for 2019."
shin-ramyun-eater,"I see. I recall Graham suggesting 75/25 depending on which whether rates are low or high, am I mistaken? Also, I'm aware while Graham's advice are great and he's revered for his work, his strategies have since been modified to many different schools of thoughts, but I'd much appreciate any effort to help me better understand the dynamics of these different distributions.

I asked him and he said he's worried if his grandparents need to go into a nursing home, his parents would have an additional financial burden, and he'd rather have the ability to contribute as much to them as possible to ease their burdens. We have similar sentiments regarding our families, but I think a nursing home wouldn't justify the kind of sum of cash he's saved up as they'd be monthly costs, so until then, he could be upping on retirement contributions."
shin-ramyun-eater,"Hi, I know you're looking for suggestions, but I'm new to retirement planning  and would like to ask; what does it mean to borrow from your 401k? Wouldn't that be borrowing from yourself? Or are there such things as borrowing *against* one's 401k?"
SomeInternetRando,"Nope, just pay it off and don't use it.  Well, buy a stick of gum or something ever few months, or they'll close it for inactivity.  But *using* it won't help your credit.  *Having* it will.  Keep it at 0."
SomeInternetRando,"If you already have a small emergency fund (like $2000 or so), I'd go ahead and knock out that car debt.  Seven years is way too long to pay off a car.  I'd want to get it paid off as soon as possible, and you can get it paid in 3 years if you throw the whole $1,000/month at it.

Personally, if I woke up and suddenly had a car loan that I couldn't pay off in 2 years, I'd sell the car and get something more affordable.  But I assume you want to keep the car."
SomeInternetRando,"Assuming no other debt, I'd put 6 months of expenses in a high interest online savings account, then pay off the car, then pay off the loans.

&gt;The federal loan is on a payment plan that basically pays the interest and is forgiven after 20 years.

I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want to pay $57,600 over the next 20 years just to have a chance at getting a $30,000 debt forgiven.

If you'll be making $120k (guessing), you can live decently on $70k and be out of debt completely by next spring.  And that's if you didn't touch your savings!  Why would you spend the next 20 years in bondage?"
SomeInternetRando,"I'd keep it in a savings account, then.  Unless you have significant savings already.

&gt;Just wondering, would it be investing because I would be keeping my money through them?

Banks are great for keeping savings in.  But they're not financial advisers or stock brokers.  They just take a commission and send your money on to people who are, for the most part."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;If I buy the house I would ask him to gift the equity as a down payment

Make sure he files a 709 form with the IRS or he'll have huge tax problems.

Otherwise, yeah, if you can get him to agree to it, it sounds like a good idea."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;and it's really hurting my credit

This, unfortunately, should be the least of your concerns.

&gt;I'm wondering if it would be better to take out a loan around 20,000 from a credit union and then can make one large monthly payment on that.

If the interest rate is lower, and you're willing to never use the cards again, otherwise you'll end up turning -$20k into -$40k.  But you'll have trouble getting a $20k unsecured loan if your credit is maxed out.

&gt;Any advice helps

If you're not working 60 hours a week, get a second job.  If you're spending on anything other than absolute necessities (cheap groceries, rent, gas, utilities) and debt payments, stop.  If you got a big tax return, adjust your withholding so you can get that money in your paychecks going forward.

We can be more specific if you post your full budget."
SomeInternetRando,"The margin of error you're working with trying to figure out which order to pay them in before all the intros expire is about $140, which out of $15,200 of debt doesn't really make a difference.  I think the mental benefits of staying focused on one debt at a time would outweigh the gains of trying to switch back and forth between them until the end of May.  I'd pay off Card 2 first, then Card 3, then Card 1."
SomeInternetRando,"Put the savings into a high yield online savings account at about 2.25% interest.

Put the money market cash into a high yield online savings account.

Sell the AMD and add it to your mutual funds.  That's too much of a percentage of your wealth to be used for fun gambling."
SomeInternetRando,"As others have said, no inheritance tax on that in the US, unless maybe your state taxes inheritance?

If you have no savings, I'm guessing you're not making enough to maintain a quarter-million-dollar house.  I'd sell the house, throw the $340k in some mutual funds, pretend it doesn't exist for 20 years, after which it'll be worth about $2 million, then retire on it.  At that point, you'll be able to pull $100,000 out of it every year without even touching the $2 million."
SomeInternetRando,"I think the thing people who try to build credit struggle with the most is the uncertainty.  FICO's algorithm is a trade secret, so somethings things change (or stop changing) and you have no idea why.  The other struggle is that changes can take a long time, and people are impatient.  Sometimes the best credit score advice is ""wait two years"", and people don't like that."
SomeInternetRando,"First thing I look for is the quality of the kitchen cabinet hinges.  If they're wobbly and floppy, or terribly off balance so they swing open or closed on their own, or the screws are at 45 degree angles and stripped, it tells me a lot about the quality of work that was done.  It's disturbing how many McMansions have crappy cabinet hinges.  But if it looks nice for a tour, and the doors don't fall off in the first 6 months, it's someone else's problem, I guess."
SomeInternetRando,"If I'm understanding your suggestion correctly, that's the correct way to go about it.

There's $10M worth of property.  Each child gets $2.5M worth of property.  

Two of them want cash, which would take $5M.  Sell the $2M and $3M properties, and pay them out. 

Now you have two children left, and $1M and $4M properties.

The child who (I assume?) doesn't care what happens gets the $1M property, and the one who wants the $4M property owes them $1.5M.  If that child doesn't have $1.5M to give their sibling, the $4M property gets sold, and the indifferent child gets $1.5M from the sale + the $1M property, and the other gets $2.5M from the sale and no property."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;RIP 2018 Mitsubishi Mirage

Congratulations!  You got out of what was probably a terrible decision!

&gt;I don't want to hurt my credit but I'd like to use my regular credit union than this random bank.

That sounds like a much better idea.

&gt;So how do I do this? Can I do this?

Go to your credit union, and talk to the person at the customer service type desk.  Just tell them you're interested in getting an auto loan.  They'll call a loan person down the hall, who will come out and get you and take you to their office.

&gt;(I am not a smart person, this was my first time buying a car.)

How much money do you make?  How much money do you have saved?"
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;debt consolidation

Meh.  If you do the math and find out that the lower interest rate compensates for the fees, then maybe.

&gt;401k to pay CC debt

Only if you're about to file bankruptcy.  And you're not.

&gt;personal loan

Won't get you a better rate than your cards, probably.

-----

You make a combined $180k.  Live on $100k, and throw $80k at the debt.  You'll be out of credit card debt in 7 months, then done with your student loans 3 years from now.

If you're considering taking out a 401k loan because you don't think you can survive on $100k/year for 3 years, then your priorities desperately need readjustment.

In 3 years, you can be completely debt free and making $370,000/year.  You're not in a bad spot.  As long as this part was true:

&gt;I'm absolutely aware how reckless the spending was, and that it is not something that will continue."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt; 6.74% interest rate

The correct rate to pay it off is as quickly as possible.

&gt;I have about 20k in the bank at the moment.

Pay off the car.  You'll be fine having $12k as an emergency fund for a while with your minimal expenses, and can use that $206/month to help build your savings back up to $20k.

&gt;by a family friend who used to set up car loans- to make minimum payments for 1 year and then pay it off outright- which would supposedly give me the max credit boost for this loan.

Don't pay interest just to build credit.  

&gt;Would it be better to make larger payments so I build less interest 

Yes.  One $8,000 payment."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt; Just use my savings

This is probably the best bet, because:

&gt; Take out a small personal loan

&gt; Cash advance on my credit card (terrible idea)

These are both things you *could still do* if you have an emergency that you can't cover with cash after paying down the car.  There's no sense in paying interest on a loan *before and until* an emergency that may never even come."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt; I was under the assumption that the lowest a score can be is 300.

It is.  When people talk about a ""zero"" credit score, they really mean an ""indeterminable"" credit score.  There's just not enough info in the credit report to assign a score.

&gt;I did read through the wiki and saw that FICO has different breakdowns, one specifically for Auto. what is the difference between a regular fico score and one specifically for Auto?

Just a different algorithm that weights the relevant factors slightly differently.  They keep their algorithms secret, so that's about the best answer that can be given, unfortunately.

&gt;and is in very good standing with another loan right now so why isn't that showing up

Then it would be *very* weird that he'd have an indeterminable credit score.  Maybe they're only reporting to one agency, and the car dealer checked a different one?

Get a 3B credit report from myfico.com, that'll give you all the FICO scores including the auto one.  It'll be about $50, but might be worth it.  There's something weird going on.  I have a ""zero"" credit score, but that only happened a while after I stopped having any open accounts."
SomeInternetRando,"An index fund (and all other types of mutual funds) is essentially just a bunch of people piling their money together to buy a *bunch* of different stocks, then splitting up they money they make.  So if I invest $100 in SWPPX, behind the scenes, I'm buying like $1 of McDonald's, $1 of Microsoft, etc.  It's just a quick and easy way to have a *really* diversified stock portfolio.  But if a lot of the stocks *in* the fund do poorly, the fund will do poorly.  Since it's so diversified, the chance of a majority of them losing money over a long period of time is pretty low.  But short term, things are a little more bumpy."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;That the 2nd payment I make will always be the same.

The amount you pay will be the same, but it'll take more money off your debt.

The way I like to think of it isn't in terms of ""$250 Principal and $750 Interest"", but more of ""Every month, my debt grows by some percentage (in this case $250), and then I pay off $1000.""

Let's say you owe $100,000 @ 5% interest. That's about 0.4% interest per month. This month, 0.4% is $400.  So at the end of this month, you'll now owe $100,400. But you pay an $800 payment, so your total owed goes down to $99,600.  In the end, you've only paid down $400 of the debt the first month.

The next month, it grows by 0.4% again, but now it's 0.4% of $99,600, which is only $398.  That takes it up to $99,998.  But then you pay off $800 again.  That takes it down to $99,198.  So this month, you've paid down $402 of the debt, vs $400 last month."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;There isn't as much work as there used to be, and I'm wondering if I should move jobs.

If you're unable to work 40+ hours/week, you either need to move jobs, or get a second job.  Or both.

&gt;I need to make a better budget than just saying hey put x here and x there.

That's the definition of a budget, though, so I'm not sure what you mean.  So far you've said you make $50k, pay $450/month in rent.  Can you post your full budget?

&gt; Is investing/playing stock market a good idea? 

Investing will be a good idea eventually, but not in your current situation.

&gt;I'd like to get a second job, but my girlfriend and I don't seem to think that's a good idea. We don't get to spend that much time together

You really have three options:

1. Give up and maintain the status quo for the rest of your life.
2. Cut your costs substantially.  Without seeing your full budget, I don't know if this is a reasonable option.
3. Increase your income.  If you're not currently working 40 hours (or preferably more), you need to be.  If this means seeing your girlfriend less, that sucks, but you're broke and drowning in debt.  A homeless guy in a cardboard box has a net worth of $50,000 more than you.  Does your girlfriend want to live that way the rest of her life, marry you, and raise kids on food stamps?  If not, she needs to support you doing what you need to do to improve your situation.  It's not permanent, but you have a big hole to dig yourself out of, and it's not going to be easy.

&gt;I have a 401k account as well, but parents tell me to forget that even exists and leave it alone.

They're right.  But you should stop contributing to it until you're out of this mess."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;The reason is that I may be foolishly tempted or tricked into cashing out before the time comes.

I suspect a lack of self control may negatively impact your life in other ways, so please consider treating the cause of the problem in addition to this symptom.

There are plenty of great retirement plan options, like a Roth IRA, traditional IRA, and 401k, but without treating the root problem, these have the potential to make things worse.  This is because you *can* withdraw from these early, but you're financially penalized for doing so.  It's possible that this will dissuade you from withdrawing, but if it doesn't, it'll put you in a worse situation than you're in now.

The only other option I can think of is to get with a lawyer and tell him you want to set up an irrevocable trust.  Then you can give that trust the money you want to save.  This would be a bit nuts, but it would give you what you want.  However, you'd lose the huge tax benefits of using proper retirement accounts."
SomeInternetRando,"&gt;My husband has 6 different credit cards

Now you do too!  Yay marriage!

&gt;with interest rates varying from 16% to like 27%

Oh wow.

&gt;He was offered a personal loan from his bank at 16% interest for 38 months (monthly payment $340) no penalties for early pay off.

How much do you guys make?  What does your budget look like?

Taking the loan looks like an improvement over your current situation as long as you stick to the plan, and don't end up running the cards back up."
Kravego,"When talking about Federal income taxes, which of the taxes specified on the W-2 are included and which (if any) are extra? Like most people, I have the following taxes withheld from my paycheck every payday:

* Federal Withholding Tax
* Federal Social Security Tax
* Federal Medicare Tax
* [State] Withholding Tax

Which of these (aside from the state one obviously) are included when talking about tax brackets? Is it just the Federal Withholding or are the SS and Medicare taxes included in that number?"
dlerium,"Putting it into ETFs and stuff. I know that's probably not the most recommended but I figure I'm young and can ride it out even if the next recession hits. If you really need the money soon and can't tolerate any massive drops, then yes a high interest savings probably makes more sense.

Anyway, my take on this subject is that $200k isn't enough in the Bay Area if you want to live in the better areas. Many articles and studies show that you need over $300k, which makes sense when you look at the whole 28/36 rule. And man it's pretty scary how some of those high paying FAANG jobs also have crazy work life balance meaning that if you decide one day you can't handle it anymore or need to make a life adjustment for kids then you really need to make sure you still have enough money to pay off the house. $6k a month means you need around $220k income minimum"
dlerium,"I know you're young and ETFs sound great for longer term savings, but with the economy slowing down and a lot of talk of 2020 recession, I think it's best to avoid the market if you want to buy a home in 1 year."
dlerium,Where do you want to live in the Bay Area? Median home prices are above 1.5 million in nicer areas but you need to know your area first. As a Bay Area native I’m pretty sure 730k doesn’t buy you a house in a nice area and while I’m not rich I’m facing the reality that I need to spend at least 1.2 if not more for an acceptable area for me.
dlerium,"&gt;Software devs are starting at $120k annual.

$120k isn't even much. New grads are getting $120k base at FAANG companies plus equity. 4-6 YOE can easily rake in $200k+ TC. This is why when you have 30 year old couples at FAANG, you're talking combined income of $500k or so.

dlerium,"$4k mortage is only $700k loan. That suggests the house price is under $1 million (assuming 20% down). The problem is Bay Area Housing prices are pretty distorted, especially in nice areas where you're easily paying $1.5 million for a starter home in Mountain View, you can see how $4k mortgage is unrealistic.

I have had that $146k saved up for some time, but the problem is I can't afford $6k a month in monthly payments!"
dlerium,"You have to gauge the risks. I got hired in 2008 after all, and I think of myself as a pretty high achiever in my role. Stocks can plummet, but they don't plummet 50% overnight either. You pull money that you need. And it's not like the day I get laid off I need to sell stocks. Finally, it's not like you sell off all your stocks at the very bottom and just never re-invest.

Also there's signs when the economy is going to go south. 2008 didn't happen overnight. There were signs in 2007 already with the market slowing, and when people talk about 50% loss, it's referring to the very bottom in early 2009 versus the market highs in late 2007.

I guess what I'm saying is that you should probably adjust your savings depending on how well that market is doing and how risk averse you are. Let's rewind to September 2008. Market crashed starting late September/October 2008. It doesn't mean you get fired day 1, and even if you do, the market hasn't tanked all that much. Selling off assets isn't a big deal. But say you don't get laid off Day 1, but given the situation looks dire, maybe it would make sense at that point to start building up cash savings instead of siphoning off $2k a month to your brokerage account, keep it in cash. By the time you get laid off in December, you might have $6k built up for instance. And even by then the market hasn't bottomed out, so you sell off $20k to help fund your expenses while you job hunt. If we tell people not time the market to invest their savings. then shouldn't the opposite hold true when you sell?

Honestly it comes down to what your job is and your financial situation. I make a decent amount in tech so it's not like I can't build up my emergency savings quickly. While you can never count on severance, I'm also familiar with some of the packages given in 2008, and unless your employer is known to be a cheap-as-hell one, I think it's fair to assume I will get something too."
dlerium,"Does savings really mean sitting in your savings account? Because where I live, rent is $3000+, and plus monthly expenses and stuff that's really like $4000, so does it really make sense to have $24,000 sitting in my bank account?

I get the whole ""What if you get fired tomorrow"" mentality, but as long as you have credit cards and assets that can be liquidated, is it really going to kill me? 

My bank account is just shy of $10k, and it fluctuates given the high rent payments, but I feel that's more than enough for any short term expenditure. For instance, we budgeted for a Model 3, but I also didn't expect the company to beat delivery estimates by 2-3 months and even after confirming the delivery date they pulled in on us another week for the 2018 Q3 push. However, I had already prepared to sell off some of my ESPP shares to fund the purchase, so I feel that as long as you have a stable investment account to draw from, then you're fine. Obviously I don't advocate having 100% of your liquid assets in LYFT for instance, but a stable ETF to me is OK."
jooshpak,The real question is if you can afford your living costs when you find a full time job. You barely have debt and you will graduate next year so cut yourself some slack and borrow a little. A few k in debt after college is not a big deal really. Take it easy.

MarcableFluke,"&gt;But wouldn’t allowance be the second number?

Don't know, not enough information to be sure exactly. You could calculate it by looking at the actual withholding amount.

&gt; So ideally I should update my allowances from 0 to 1?

Ideally, you and your spouse set your withholdings such that you don't owe or aren't due a refund at the end of the year. What that means in terms of your W-4s, I couldn't say without the full picture."
MarcableFluke,What's the driver behind wanting to consolidate? Federal consolidation uses a weighted interest rate that is rounded up to the nearest 8th of a percent. So you'll likely end up paying a little more in the long run. Refinancing with a private company will get rid of student loan forgiveness option.
MarcableFluke,"&gt; I've been told that it can be cheaper in the long run to rent than to buy

Whoever told you that is mistaken. Renting is better for short term housing options. Owning is better if you plan on staying long term. Note that ""better"" in this context is only looking at the financial implications."
MarcableFluke,"So much to correct...

The money you get back is called a *refund*. A *return* is what you file to get your *refund*.

On your W-4, you claim *allowances*, not *dependents*. There is no direct mapping between allowances and people in the family.

Comparing refunds is like comparing the change you get back at the grocery store, it's pointless.

Married Filing Separately was never intended to reduce a couple's tax liability. It was intended for people with separate finances, like couples going through a divorce."
MarcableFluke,"&gt;I tried using the calculator through the IRS and it said I would owe 2k in taxes next year.

What are the actual numbers? Unless you have multiple jobs, claiming 2 is the proper amount for a single person with no dependents, taking the standard deduction."
MarcableFluke,"&gt; This Act defines overtime as anything over 40 hours in any 7 consecutive days, from what I understand.

Incorrect. It's more than 40 hours in a workweek. The workweek begins on the same day of the week. It's not a rolling 7 day period."
MarcableFluke,"I was making the comparison for general purposes when talking about income and property taxes to support my point that the difference in taxes is overblown. If we want to keep it specific to OPs situation, then why are you bringing up Texas data points? Last I checked, Texas isn't part of the Midwest."
MarcableFluke,"Well, it doesn't legally become your debt if that's what you're asking. On the other hand, it does become your debt from a practical perspective. If she goes on an income based repayment plan, it will be based on your combined income unless you feel separately. If she defaults and you file jointly, your refund may be garnished. Similarly, any joint accounts could also be garnished."
MarcableFluke,"&gt; Is it normal for a family to owe so much money on their income taxes?

It's hard to say, you've given very little information. All I can say, is yes, it's very normal for a families to pay $11k + $X on $140k annual income."
MarcableFluke,"&gt;I'm getting a reasonable income but if I am adding the same value to the company as someone else, shouldn't I be getting paid similarly? Or am I being too greedy?

Neither.

*Same responsibilities* doesn't mean *same pay*; that's not how the world works. On the other hand, there is nothing greedy about seeking a raise or finding a new job that pays better."
MarcableFluke,"&gt; Is there a difference in what you pay in taxes between Single and Married Filing Separately? I think it's the same but figured I'd ask.

There *might* be a difference. The tax tables are different, and you lose out on eligibility for certain deductions by filling separately, like student loan interest. So it depends on your situation.

&gt;Would filing as Married Filing Jointly mean we pay less taxes? So if I just kept my withholding the same I would get a bigger refund?

Versus single? Not necessarily. If you guys make similar incomes, there won't likely be a difference."
MarcableFluke,"Many people had trouble with PSLF. I think the statistics was something like 99% were denied forgiveness. But that statistics lacks important context. Nearly a third were declined due to missing information. Furthermore, people who were denied weren't denied with prejudice, so it's not like they spent 10 years paying and none of it counts (although that is likely the case for some). Lastly, people eligible would have needed to be on the program from near the beginning to be eligible. We have a much better understanding of the requirements now-a-days."
therealfatmike,"No problem, does it have an annual fee?

Oh shit, just your response to someone else.  Yeah, close that account in 11 months.  A secured credit card is better than paying those fees that should really be illegal.  Be smart and patient and soon enough you'll have an unsecured card with a little cash back.  You're making the right moves, best of luck!"
therealfatmike,"I know this doesn't help but you need more income.  Can you look for a higher paying and more reliable job?  

Why do you need a new car? A five year old car would be just fine and get your payment down.

therealfatmike,"Don't forget about the warranties that come with new cars.  When you buy used you're truly getting it ""as is."" You will save money but run a real risk of a huge repair bill from hidden damage or a unlucky part failure that kills your engine or transmission.  Also, better financing.

therealfatmike,Does your loan have early pay off options or penalties?  Put enough into savings for an emergency fund and the rest into paying down the car loan or sell it because that's not a good income to car value ratio.
therealfatmike,"What fees?  What kind of credit line?

If it's a credit card, you shouldn't have to pay any interest if you pay it in full each month, you have to use it a little bit to build credit but you don't ever have to carry a balance."

I've been saving for a few years now and will have enough for a 20-25% down payment depending on the cost of the house. I haven't starting any of the process yet other than starting to look at houses and make notes on what I want and don't want houses to have like a wishlist in order of importance. 


The house I currently live in was purchased a few months before I moved in by one of my friends and I rent a room from him while he lives in the master bedroom. He uses my rent to pay his mortgage and puts a little extra into a house maintenance fund to ""save for a rainy day"". I plan on also renting out a room or two in my new house but is this the best way to do it?

Should I keep a special account for rent coming in and ""charge myself rent"" to make up the difference too? I'm planning on buying a house I can afford without the renters in case something happens so I won't be hurting for the money and I kind of plan on using it as entertainment money so if I don't have renters then I do less fun things till I get some. I also want to put some of it away to eventually either upgrade my house or buy another one. Can that all be done from the separate special account I would have for it?"
PM_ME-UR_UNDERBOOB,"Not trying to accuse but any other info about the account could be relevant. Some ideas off the top of my head are:

Is the account under anyone elses' name? Joint or otherwise

Is the account a regular checking account or does it have any special stipulations?

Have you had this account info compromised before?

Stuff like that"
PM_ME-UR_UNDERBOOB,"Costco is probably one of, if not the best place to work as a part time college student. One of my really good friends started working at Costco as soon as he started college, like you, and once he graduated he continued working at costco full time. Since he worked so many hours through school he now makes just as much money as I do with an engineering degree vs his business degree and he does't use his degree at all. "
Kawabuchi,"Nope, she arrived in the states in January, and we were married shortly after, so this year will be the first she will be filing US taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess she'll have to start paying US taxes on money she already had that I have no access or rights to..... gotta love it"
Kawabuchi,"Open CD to offset loan? Good morning PF!

&amp;#x200B;

Last month wifey and I bought a car for her.  $25.5k out the door, put 10.5k down in cash, borrowed 15k @3.54% (5yr loan).  I could have paid it all in cash, but didn't want to dip THAT far into savings.  Navy Federal offers a 40-month CD at 3.75% APY (3.68 dividend).  I'm considering putting the 15k into that CD to offset any interest I'd pay on the car loan, plus make a dollar or two, then maybe just pay off the loan when the CD matures.  Thoughts?"
Kawabuchi,I should probably add that I started considering the CD ladder instead of cash in online savings simply because I've got \~70k cash between my two credit unions.  I can't imagine losing absolutely everything and needing that emergency fund.  Currently weighing paying cash for wife's car or taking a loan (2-3%) and investing the rest.
Kawabuchi,"To make it simple, let's say that you lived and worked abroad from Jan 1 to Dec 31.  During that time, as long as you were outside the US for 330 or more days, you qualify for the exemption.  So realistically, you could come back to the states for a whole month and still be ok.  Can also work on partial years, as long as you had your 330 days.  Example- I spent 2.5 years overseas from Dec 2014 to July 2017.  I moved back from overseas July 2 2017, and since I was overseas for more than 330 days from July 2 2016-2017, I was able to claim exemption for the first half of 2017.

&amp;#x200B;

So you need to take a look at the dates really.  From the day you moved back to the US, go back 12 months.  If during that 12 months you were present in a foreign country for more than 330 days, you qualify under the physical presence test.

&amp;#x200B;

Usual disclaimer:  I'm not a lawyer, tax professional, or other.  My response is how I interpreted the law."
Kawabuchi,"I tend to get buyer's remorse on large items as well.  Recently picked up a new big screen tv, and even though I got it on sale, and had plenty of cash in the bank, I just hate parting with that much money.  Felt the same way when I replaced my HVAC system and had new siding installed, so even necessary expenditures bother me if the cost is high.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd just try to not think about it.  I got over my remorse for my recent purchases within a week or two.  "
Kawabuchi,"As long as you are outside the US for 330 days or more of a 12-month period, you qualify for FEIE based on the physical presence test.  You should be able to file a form 673 with your employer to stop having federal income tax withheld, and at the end of the year you file a 2555 with your 1040's.  Claiming FEIE will basically give your first 100k of income a pass on income taxes.

&amp;#x200B;

I was overseas from Dec 2014 to Jul 2017, so was able to claim all that time and not pay income tax.  Even though 2017 I was overseas only half the year, that half wasn't taxed as the previoius 12 months I had been out for over 330 days."
Kawabuchi,"Am I on the right track? (US) I have given myself the next six months to straighten out financial stuff (though plan to be done sooner than that).  Among changes will be 401k allocations, changing credit unions, investing, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just got married last week, so I need tos ubmit a new W-4 and VA-4 to adjust exceptions.  If I understand the W-4 form, I should be claiming three exceptions- one for me, one for married filing jointly, and one for filing jointly with one job and a non-working spouse.  Should I be doing more than three?  On the VA-4, I'll change my exceptions to two, one for each of us.  I currently make about 97000 USD per year.  I am only at 6% for my 401k, which I'll be bumping up to 7% for this year, 8% next, etc.  I know I'm not maxing out 401k at the moment, but I'll be working towards that.  I generally contribute to my Roth IRA as well.  

&amp;#x200B;

I own a condo, valued around $275k.  I owe a little under 60k, and should have that payed off in the next seven to eight years.  No outstanding credit card debt, everything gets paid off when I get the bill.  I've got roughly 70k in the bank.

&amp;#x200B;

Upcoming expenses- my wife just moved to the states, so we still have immigration fees to pay for, need to buy her a car, and want to redo some of the furniture in the house.  Also still waiting for her SSN to arrive so I can add her to the health insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I'm missing?  Anything I should make sure to do sooner than later (aside from changing W4/VA4 exceptions)?  Thanks in advance for the advice!"
Kawabuchi,"I've been a member of NWFCU for about 10ish years, and I'm about to close the account.  They've been good for the most part, except that the interest rates on their savings products are garbage.  I'm talking .05% on some of my accounts.  Over the last few years the rates on savings has gone down but the rate in loans has gone up.  Does not compute.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're able to join Navy Federal, they're not bad."
Kawabuchi,"Emergency funds- online in cash, or local in CDs? 37m, married, single income about 100k in Washington DC area.  Outside the monthly credit card bill, no debts.  Actively contributing to 401k, IRA, and I've given myself the first half of this year to review my finances and make changes for better financial health later in life.  

&amp;#x200B;

Currently working on my emergency funds.  I've got well over 6 months of cash in the bank, planning to invest some later this year once life settles down a bit (wife just moved here from overseas, still have immigration expenses, need a car for her, minor upgrades on the house).  It looks to me like a lot of people are using online banks for their 2%+ interest rates, which is nice.  

&amp;#x200B;

Since we're talking about money that may not be needed right away (hopefully never), what about putting the money into a CD ladder?  One of my credit unions has a 1-years CD at 2.28% (2.3 apy).  I was thinking, instead of opening a new account with an online bank, maybe I'd just create a monthly CD for one or two thousand bucks, and let them roll over year after year.  Based on the CU's paperwork, if I withdrawl the money from the CD, I lose up to 6 months of interest, which sucks, but if it's an emergency, I can't see a huge problem.

&amp;#x200B;

So, thoughts on doing a CD ladder instead of opening an online account with a new bank?"
Kawabuchi,"I started with Fi about at year ago.  My average bill has been about 35 dollars.  Now that I've got my wife on the plan, the average bill is about 55 dollars.  Luckily she's on wifi almost all the time, and my phone is off during the day (can't have it in the office), so we don't use much data.  If you use a ton of data, Fi may not be very good for you, but it will at least save a few bucks over what you're paying now."
Kawabuchi,70k is the total of emergency fund and other money.  Right now the money I consider as my emergency fund is sitting in a second credit union that I don't use very often due to garbage interest rates.  Was trying to figure a way to make the money work a little bit more for me than getting .05%
Kawabuchi,"Reporting foreign bank accounts? So my wife is from overseas.  Just moved here about three months ago, has a SSN, not working yet (may not as we can live on my income comfortably).  Being a non-citizen, is she required to report her bank accounts back in her country?  I know for US citizens, foreign accounts with more than 10k must be reported.  Hers is over 10k, but she's not a citizen.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for the advice!"
Kawabuchi,"Yeah, that's part of the homework.  I've got about 15k in my older credit union, whose interest rates keep going down for savings but up on loans.  I'll be moving most of that money to a high-interest account somewhere.  DOn't want to close the account completely as the CC I have from them has the longest credit history \~10 years (used to have an 18yr old cap one card, but I forgot to use it and they closed it).

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"
Kawabuchi,"If you're going to be overseas long term, take a look at the form 673.  It basically has your employer not withhold any fed income taxes, so you don't have to wait for a huge return at the end of the year when you file the 2550 (foreign earned income exclusion)."
BobbyRed,"It isn't a limited time offer. Those 0% interest credit cards are fairly numerous and plentiful. If you carry a balance month to month, I would say to hold back on applying for a 0% interest rate credit card because you will be tempted to impulse buy. "

So can I just leave my checking at $0 and keep all the money I have in my Ally Savings account, and when I have bills I need to pay(connected to Checking account), I don't have to lift a finger?"
BobbyRed,You should probably start with a secured credit card. I would probably apply for it right now rather than wait. I recommend the Capital One Secured MasterCard. You are more likely to be accepted if you have income you can put down.
BobbyRed,"You can either remove yourself as an authorized user or apply for more credit cards to raise your total credit limit. 

I would remove the authorized card, because having that high of a utilization isn't worth the length of credit history since it sounds like already have 2 cards with some history."
BobbyRed,"The age of a closed CC stays on your credit history for 10 years then it falls off, thereby lowering your Average Age of Accounts and your credit score taking a small hit.

Opening a CC will result in a hard pull, resulting in a small credit score hit right now."
BobbyRed,TurboTax Schedule B I made more than $1500 from bank account bonuses last year and TurboTax wants me to pay $39.99 to upgrade to the premium to file Schedule B. Should I just pay the amount or use another tax preparation software?
BobbyRed,"You need to get the Discover IT and use it wisely for half a year. You should see your credit slowly climb during that time and when your credit score hits 700+ is when you can get credit cards that have great sign up offers that will give you enough points to cover at least one person for an international flight. 
"
BobbyRed,"Any non-secured credit card will probably require the applicant to have an income. If you have a part-time job, that will greatly increase your chances of getting your second card. 

If you want to get into churning, I would advise getting the Chase Freedom or Chase Freedom Unlimited, because it is important to build history with Chase first in your churning journey. I would get into churning if you have lots of expenses(about $3000-$6000 expenses every 3 months) in the near future. All the cards you get for churning will require that much spend to get the sign up reward. 

Get the Citi DC if you don't care much for getting new cards every few months and just want one for all your spend."

XRanger7,"Automatic credit limit increase is a common practice and banks don’t need your consent for it.

I would argue that the bank actually did you a favor by increasing your credit limit as it means your credit utilization will be lower. You can spend more without affecting your credit score. "
XRanger7,"I would do repaye but pay more than the minimum to cover interest. For 300k, the interest alone is gonna be around 1k. If you’re just paying the minimum it could balloon up to 500k by the time you’re done. You can pay off 300k pretty quick once you’re attending "
XRanger7,"Most doctors are not employees of the hospital so they bill separately.

XRanger7,"Debt settlement question I have a debt from 2010 that went to collection. I got a letter that says debt amount $181 but then it says “we are authorized to resolve your account for less than full balance for a payoff amount of $81. Upon receipt and clearance of $81 your account will be satisfied”

I never have debt go into collection before. Does this mean I can just pay $81 instead of $181? Will it affect me in anyway if I pay $81 vs $181 in terms of credit score, etc...?

"
XRanger7,"Debt in collection - how to proceed? I just got a letter from collection agency ERC saying I have old debt from ATT from dec 2016 that have gone to collection and has been reported to the credit bureau. Honestly I don’t recall having a debt. I paid off all my bills to the best of my knowledge but I did use ATT during this time so it might be legitimate. The amount is $180 and I can just pay it off in full no problem but after research online on what the best course of action is, this might be not the best route as it still stays on the credit report.

So there are couple of options that I’m considering after researching online:
1) dispute it through the credit karma app
2) send a debt validation letter to the collection agency asking for proof
3) send a pay for delete letter to the collection agency 

I’m thinking of just going with option 3 as I can pay it and I just want it to disappear but what if I send a PFD letter and they said no. What do I do next? 

Or is it better if I dispute it first?

toritxtornado,"we aren’t planning on doing a backdoor because we don’t want to pay taxes now. i’d rather pay taxes when i take it out because i expect to be in a lower tax bracket in retirement. 

i’ve already rolled my traditional 401k for one company into a rollover IRA (which i’ve read is just a traditional IRA) with no issue. i want to make sure we are making the right call before i do it for to the other ones. 

sorry if i’m missing something here. i’m still learning. thanks for responding. "
toritxtornado,"this is a tough one. in my low-mid COL area, i’d say job #2. in a HCOL area, it might make a big lifestyle difference if you take the second. if you can save for an emergency fund and retirement, pay your bills, and have enough leftover for vacations, hobbies, kids, etc., go for job #2. if you’re going to be struggling with any of that, i’d be tempted to take job #1. "
toritxtornado,"i am in the income bracket where i need to do a roth IRA; i’m not sure where to find the expense ratios for my 401k. looks like it only gained 2.17% in the last year, so i’m thinking i could get higher in an IRA. 

why would the backdoor IRA sitch make a difference? we’re probably just going to keep it in traditional because we’ll withdraw less in retirement than we make today so will be in the same or a lower tax bracket in retirement. "
toritxtornado,"why do you think unlimited vacation doesn’t sound like a real thing? 

my current company has and the company before that had unlimited pto. my husband’s current company has and previous 2 companies before that had it. we’ve taken a ton of vacations and get to take personal days, mental health days, staycations, and sick days whenever we want. i think unlimited pto is becoming the norm in many industries."
toritxtornado,"ah, ok. we do both have 401ks at work, so we can’t deduct our IRA. it sounds like the best thing for us to do at this point is to:

1) rollover our traditional 401ks from
previous employers to traditional IRAs

2) max out our 401ks

3) max out traditional IRAs

4) pay taxes when we take the money out in retirement"
toritxtornado,"i’m in this same situation. you can still submit an 8606 after you’ve filed your taxes, as long as it’s before the 15th. i contributed the $5500 to my traditional today and will convert it to a roth as soon as it gets there from my checking acct (2-3 days). i’m really cutting it close."

2. if i contribute the $6000 max from my checking account to a rollover ira and then move that over to a roth, that $6000 is already taxed, right? so i wouldn't have to pay extra taxes on that? what am i missing?
3. assuming i dont have to pay taxes again in the above scenario: i already submitted by taxes for 2018. would i have to resubmit if i contributed $6000 for 2018 to my rollover ira and then moved it to a roth?"

Fakabats,"Question.     My CC’s are all paid off.   Should I make purchase and then pay them off entirely within the month or should I have a standing balance?  

Example.   I purchase a latte...and then as soon as the transaction is recorded on my acc....pay it off immediately.   Will this really boost my Credit score?"
Fakabats,"Are there any companies that will add you as an authorized user in order to boost your credit rating? So i'm just wondering if there are any companies that would add me as an authorized user to boost my Credit Score. 

Both of my parents have passed and my siblings are too young for credit cards. 


My credit score is 620 and I've recently removed all delinquent accounts from my credit history.  "
Fakabats,"I opened a secured Credit Card with Capitol One; they converted the account into a regular credit card, added $200 but never sent me back my initial $1,000 deposit; is this legal? So yeah, i opened a secured C.C. w/ Capital One.  My intial deposit was $1,000.  However they told me due to my good job keeping up with the account, they'd convert the secured account to a regular credit car. 

So they converted it to a regular credit card and added $200 of their own credit to the account making the total $1,200. They never did refund me my initial $1,000.  Is this a industry norm? Or should I ask for my initial $1,000 back?

Thank you all for your suggestions and ultimate wisdom!"
Fakabats,"No.    So one of the tricks to boosting your credit score goes as follows. 


You Metrazol have 800+ credit score.   You have a credit card that has a 20k line of credit.   You’ve had the credit card for 6 years.     Now...me.   My credit score is “ok”. Maybe 620.    If you add me as an authorized user...but don’t issue me a credit card; I reap the benefits of your due diligence.   You just continue to do what you’ve been doing, paying your monthly credit statement, and I reap the benefits without ever using your card 


So to reiterate....you have great credit...you add me as an authorized user, I never use or am issued your credit card.   As long as you continue to pay off your credit card / statements, then whatever is reported to the 3 Credit bureaus about you...is also reported against my credit score 

Best part is...there’s 0 liability as even if I continue to have negative reports to the bureau, it’ll never affect your score 


I hope that makes sense?  "
Fakabats,I wasn't aware of the expectations.  I simply thought they'd have to keep the initial deposit.  It's only now that I've realized that it should've been distributed to me after reading another redditor here whom explained that he received his initial deposit after his secured card changed to an unsecured credit card. 
Fakabats,"I will be 100% sincere....sure I want a car and house in the coming years.....but the real reason...and I KNOW ITS COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL....is because I want an American Express Credit Card.  


Again...I know how stupid it is, but I just want an AMEX.   I don’t know where this longing for the card derived from, but I want one; and to be honest, I don’t think it’s that bad since I don’t have any vices, I don’t ever ask for anything from anyone.

Yeah. "
Fakabats,"i'm so sorry; i don't understand the question. 

The card allows me to use the C.C. up to 1300; then pay it off, there isn't a way to remove the initial deposit of 1,000?

i did pay off the card weekly/by statement though? "
Fakabats,"no, this c.c. works differently? 

I just spoke with them, they say that if I am correct, they'll refund the money. 

The initial 1k i placed  was used as a 1k limit; i would spend 1k, then pay it back; but i'm paying myself back, right?  "
throwz6,"If you're following Ramsey, you need to finish the car off with your savings today.

I would recommend sticking with Dave and getting debt free quickly. It's not worth staying in debt just because the interest rate is low. $5,000 is plenty to start your emergency fund with and the benefit of getting a slightly better interest rate on $30k is essentially nothing."

sucitreb,$2.20 over the course of a year. There are other options for high yield checking accounts (I assume BoA checking accounts give you basically no interest). Ally has checking accounts as well at a slightly lower interest rate than a savings account. So you could use that instead of BoA if you want.

I was in a similar situation, I bought an accord with 180k miles for $3,200. I invested $600 for new tires, belts, and a complete tune up which included new wires and plugs. Two years later when I didn't need it I sold it for $4,200 with just under 226k miles. "
Fuspo,"When it comes to medical bills you can also set up a payment plan. I did this for a $4,500 medical bill for my daughter. I called them said I can do payments and they will give you a number. I told them sorry I can only do $5/month, it's either that or nothing. They accepted and I'll probably die before it's ever paid off. As long as you're making payments they can't send you to collections. "
Fuspo,"Asking For A Friend: Sent to collections for rent. My friend is in a situation where her old roommate didn't pay his half of the rent when they moved out and she did. Since they were both on the were on the lease but has now gone to collections. She figured she'd just call it a loss and pay the debtor however they claim that they don't send any sort of promise to delete notice, that they ""just do it"". So of course now she's wondering what other options she has. The total amount owed is $1600USD, since then the other party has changed number and address so no real lead on him other than his license plate number as it was a custom plate and easily remembered. Is small claims an option? If so how can one be successful with this route. I'm guessing he can be found by a process server or constable with his license plate to be served. What can be done with the debtor to cover herself with them truly deleting the debt off her credit once paid? Thanks."
Ghost4113,"It doesn’t totally reverse it because it’s still a mark on your credit.  Creditors don’t forgive and forget as soon as you pay them back lol.  However, it’s going to be exponentially harder to raise your score with outstanding collections."
Ghost4113,"If you pay the collection, you will have an exponentially harder time removing it from your credit.  I would talk to a lawyer.  You will end up paying more than $85, but at this point you have to decide if your credit is worth more than $85.

Pay it and have a 7 year black mark, or fight it, pay more, and have clean credit."
Ghost4113,"I used to get paid twice a month, but changed it to once a month.  I found it let me make better progress toward my financial goals because I was able to budget expenses and immediately use the “extra” to reduce debt/invest/etc.  The hardest part was making a realistic and accurate budget, and getting used to sticking to it!"
Ghost4113,"Depends on the bank I think.  I’ve never had an issue with large banks USAA, Navy Fed, AMEX, etc, but I have heard stories where smaller credit unions won’t backdate it and just start from when you notify them.  Synchrony Bank backdated it a couple years for my motorcycle loan lol."
Ghost4113,"If you can’t afford insurance then you can’t afford the car.  That being said, with no insurance, anything you do to claim the damage is going to be insurance fraud.  Sounds like you’re going to be driving a dented car for a while."
Ghost4113,"Check online for an investor relations or executive service phone number and call them.  You might have to dig a little for it, but you will get someone who will probably take ownership of the issue and get it resolved for you.

I would also check your credit report and make sure they haven’t been reporting you as delinquent."
Ghost4113,"Everything said above.  However, 5% (in a short timeframe) is a solid return, so if it’s only been a few weeks, I would probably take profit and get into something else.  If this is a long play, then you may want to hold."
Ghost4113,"It’s up to the lease company, but usually there is a grace period of a few days.  If you really want to know, just call them and explain the situation.  Most lenders are easy to work with if you communicate with them."
Ghost4113,"If you're exempt from FLSA, then they are probably just doing it because of a payroll system that doesn't have a better way to account for salaried employees and $32.45 for 40 hours per week is equivalent to your stated salary.

&amp;#x200B;

If you are NOT FLSA exempt, they are doing this to avoid paying you overtime.

Ghost4113,"For most/all of the AMEX rewards cards the bonus points/cash back are based on how the business is coded.  Grocery stores that sell gas are probably coded as grocery stores and therefore won’t count as gas purchases.  

The flip side is my local gas station has a convenience store and all purchases there are coded as gas purchases."
Ghost4113,"This.  Unfortunately, the bank doesn’t care who has the vehicle or what the terms of the divorce are.  It could have been leverage for you to keep the vehicle during the divorce proceedings, or you could have forced him to refinance the lease to get your name off of it when he took it.  At this point, the bank just wants their money and you’re on the hook for it.  You could talk to an attorney about your options to go after him for the money, but unfortunately you’re not likely to be successful."
Ghost4113,"Sounds to me like you live and work in PA, and visit your family in NJ on the weekends.  For tax purposes, you live and work in PA and should probably file PA taxes.  You are technically evading those taxes by claiming to still live with your parents while maintaining a primary residence and primary source of income in PA."
Ghost4113,"I would recommend an index fund over a CD or IRA to get started.  The cash is more liquid in case of an emergency (no penalty for taking it out early), and the returns are generally at least 2-3 times what you will get in a CD.  I would look at Fidelity’s FXAIX, or something similar from Vanguard."
Ghost4113,7 years is how long it can stay on there.  You can try disputing it but they could say no and keep it on there if they want to.  Verizon is notorious for not removing it until it falls off after 7 years.
Ghost4113,"I’ve sold cars with liens before.  Basically you do a bill of sale for the buyer, then take his money and pay off the loan.  As soon as you get the title/lien release letter depending on your state, you give it to them and they can go re-title it and register it in their name.  It does take some time to go through that process but it’s not impossible.  Be aware some buyers aren’t going to want to deal with it and may walk away from the deal.

You can also always take it to a dealership and sell it to them.  This will make the process much simpler, but you definitely won’t get as much money."
Ghost4113,"People on this sub will probably disagree with me, but you have to take the hit on your first loan if you ever want a better one.  I recommend getting the cheapest new car you can and don’t worry about any options.  It might suck not having all the convenience options, but once you prove to the bank that you’re responsible enough to finance a vehicle, you’re interest rates will be MUCH lower.  You just have to realize they are taking a massive risk with a first time car buyer.  

My first new car was a base Kia Rio5 at 18%.  I paid a little extra on the payments and sold it private party as soon as I had positive equity (a couple years later).  My next loan was a much lower interest rate."
Bobeerto,"No, company match is typically dollar-for-dollar matching of the first 4-8%. You can invest $19k of your own money, and the company match is above and beyond that limit.

&amp;#x200B;

Roth IRA limit is $6k this year.

&amp;#x200B;

Between those two tax-advantaged accounts, you should be able to easily save the bonus itself or an equivalent amount from your paycheck, depending on how the company disburses the bonus."
Bobeerto,"Max your Roth IRA and 401k, then supplement income with the bonus?

Maxed already? Backdoor Roth a matching amount and supplement income with bonus.

Basically find a way to map the bonus to tax-advantaged accounts, then use the bonus to fill in the gaps missing from your paycheck. "
Bobeerto,"Why VIMSX?

If you’re shooting for a balanced 3-fund portfolio, you’d want the total US bond market index instead of VIMSX. Or you could do the 4-fund portfolio that vanguard recommends and split up the bonds across total US and total International indices. 

Edit: Also, at 22 you probably don’t really need any bond holdings. If you looked up your age-adjusted retirement fund (2060?), it’s probably mostly VTSAX. "
Bobeerto,"For the most part, no. If financially supporting a kid sounds tough, that’s because it is. If that sounds miserable, don’t have a kid. 

We have more people alive now than have ever lived in the history of humankind. We don’t really need more people. "
Bobeerto,"Yes. It’s called a conversion (as opposed to a rollover). Your provider will have you submit a different form. 

And yes, sort of - Roth IRAs are not subject to RMDs, required minimum distributions, but also are not as safeguarded as a Roth 401k (varies by state). "
Bobeerto,"That looks more legit.

Btw, Vanguard thinks this is a good mix if you’re retiring 40 years from now. I think they started recommending 4-fund portfolios a few years ago:

- Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (53.86 percent)
- Vanguard Total International Stock Index (36 percent)
- Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index (7.13 percent)
- Vanguard Total International Bond Index (2.9 percent)

Bobeerto,Sorry this happened to you. I was scammed by LA Fitness recently. Everyone should be on high alert walking into any gym membership. Nearly all gyms sustain themselves through scams and it’s somehow not as well known as it ought to be with tools like Reddit. 
Bobeerto,"&gt; Interestingly, every time I've called the rep has to take a few minutes to look up the details. They clearly don't get many calls about this option!

The magic words that work for me are:

*I am still employed at the company. I need to speak with an in-service Roth conversion specialist.*

It seems to preemptively answer all their canned questions and gets you handed over to someone who knows more. "
Bobeerto,"&gt; $6k limit applies to all IRA contribution

No disagreement here. Never said anything to the contrary. 

&gt; a backdoor Roth IRA doesn't let you contribute more. 

Never said this. You are putting words in my mouth. I said “backdoor Roth”. Requires after-tax 401k contribution that you either roll over into your Roth IRA OR do an in-service conversion into a Roth 401k. 

&gt;  the OP's income isn't past the phase out that calls for using a backdoor Roth

Bad assumption. You don’t know how much he’s saving or if he’s got other income streams. "
Bobeerto,"Congrats. FYI you can do an in-service *conversion* to a Roth *401k* as an alternative to an in-service rollover to a Roth IRA. 

Monetarily, it’s the same thing, but legally your money might be better guarded in the Roth 401k were you ever to be sued. I believe this safeguard varies by state.  "

Russ_93,"Travel credit cards I recently went on my first Royal Caribbean cruise and absolutely enjoyed every minute of it. So with that being said I would really want to go on another RC cruise next year so I applied for the Royal Caribbean Credit card for those 10K points to use on another cruise. BUT my problem is this now, I noticed that the rewards with RC card are a little plain nothing much beside the x2 on RC purchases and x1 on everything else. So would it be a good idea to just keep using the RC card for literally everyday purchases and pay the balance off every month to get my points up more OR is there another card I can get that is better than this with no annual fee? I do currently have a Frontier world master card with an annual fee of i believe $90,BUT i can only use those points for frontier flights unfortunately. I herd a Chase Sapphire card would benefit me more with a fee of $95/yr. Should i cancel my Frontier card and use my points i have for whever i do decided to fly and keep chase for cruises? Little confused here as I will be traveling minimum of 1 time/yr possible more. I dont see myself traveling more than 3-4 times/yr so would it be better for my in this case to get rid of frontier and get chase sapphire?"
ItzChiips,My parents are self employed so my coverage is pretty bad right now. Luckily I am pretty healthy and rarely have to go to the doctor. I might stay on their for a couple months after starting just to save a few bucks but definitely want to switch sooner rather than later just in case.
ItzChiips,$70 a month!!!! Man I hope mine is anywhere close to that! I will probably do the most basic plan possible I guess because I am pretty healthy and don't have much doctor visits other than like the annual physical and if I get strep or something. 
ItzChiips,I'm glad your experience has been good. Do you know what your city is rated in terms of crime &amp; whatnot? [https://www.neighborhoodscout.com](https://www.neighborhoodscout.com) pegs the city we want to move to in the 33% percentile for safety. I might feel better if we compare and yours is similar lol. 
ItzChiips,"Appropriate amount to spend on rent? Hey guys. My girlfriend and I will be moving in about 4-6 months. I will be making $70k a year starting and she might have job lined up for about $50k give or take. We both have significant amount of student loans. I will have about $40k when we move and she will have about $63k. We want to move to this city that is about half way between both of our jobs. The issue is there are some pretty sketchy parts of the city and rent prices vary quite a bit. I will be working much more than her and don't want to have to worry about her when she is home alone and whatnot. This could mean spending upwards of $2000 to $2100 a month in rent. My concern is whether we would be able to afford this and still max out our retirement &amp; save some money after all other expenses are paid. I guess, does it financially make sense or should we seek other options? All advice appreciated.  "
ItzChiips,"Gotcha, 25%. Yeah, I guess we need to make sure she gets that job before we make any decisions. I definitely couldn't cover it alone. I would value security #1 as well and I think the area we live in is also considered HCOL. Thanks =) "
ItzChiips,"That is a good point, I hadn't considered the government loans would be further deferred while she was in grad school. Do you know if this is an option if she is only a part time student? And I guess we would be considered to be engaged to be engaged. We have been together almost 6 years now and I plan on proposing possibly next summer with a cheaper ring once I get my loans under control. Also, I had not known how much her debt was until very recently. She hadn't really even known exactly how much she had. Unfortunately her parents handled all of that for her. "
ItzChiips,"What to expect for health insurance? Hey guys. 22 M moving out in about 6 or 7 month and starting my first ""career"" job in 3 months. I will be switching to their health insurance from my parents. I know there is no exact amount but what can I estimate that I will be paying monthly? People have told me anywhere between $200 and $800 a month. I am trying to budget and plan ahead but I have no idea what to expect. Thanks in advance! =)

EDIT: Solved! Thanks everyone"
ItzChiips,You haven't had any issues or worry about being in an area like that? I wouldn't mind saving on the rent I just worry about my girlfriend. Long hours are inherent in my line of work and she will be alone a lot during sometimes of the year. 
ItzChiips,Personal to business loan to buy a car?? Hey guys. A friend of mine has a small LLC. He want's to buy a new car that will be used for a mix of personal and business. He wants to loan the business the money for the car and then pay himself back from the company with interest. Can he do that and what is the maximum amount of interest he could charge himself? Thanks! 
ItzChiips,"Please Help Me Plan Hey guys. I posted about a week ago but have some updates &amp; need some more advice. So I will be graduating in May with $62,500 in student loans. I have means to get that down to about $10 - $15k before my payments begin in January of 2020. My girlfriend and I are going to be moving to a nearby city and will be paying anywhere between $1,300 &amp; $1,700 for rent. She will be graduating in May as well with about the same amount of loans as I have. She unfortunately does not have any means to bring that amount down before payments begin and still has to do a Masters degree. Also, about half of her loans are private and have a 6 - 7% interest rate. I am getting really worried about her loans and how much I should help her. She will begin substitute teaching hopefully while doing her Masters and maybe some tutoring if possible. I don't think she will make any more than $25-30k a year until she becomes a full time teacher. I will be making $70k gross. Using some online estimated payment calculators, almost all of her income will be going towards her student loan payments which really concerns me. What are your recommendations for tackling her student loans? I assume I will have to foot our rent, groceries, utilities, etc until she gets out from under her loans a bit. Should I be as worried as I am? Also, If I do have residual income and a emergency savings and whatnot, should I help her with her payments? The amount of interest alone that she would pay by making minimum payments I feel would really impede any future plans of maybe one day getting a house or things like that. Please, all advice and ideas are welcome. Thanks guys!"
ItzChiips,"Yeah, that's a fair point and I have considered it. Hopefully that will never be an issue. We have been dating for about 5 years now and living together for about 1 year and have no issues.

My post was in reference to my down voted comment in which I stated that, ""should OP desire to keep some of his wealth (keep - he already owns a significant amount) then I have given him an alternative with which he could earn a passive income. Nothing outrageous, just a small but significant improvement. And since this wasn't the first time I was down voted for a crypto related suggestion, I wrote what I wrote. But sure, wasn't directly related to the post. "

crackerjack3195,I think he was honestly just trying to help me out. He had just finished his degree and got a job as a financial planner right at the same time that I was looking to start seriously investing some spare money and we were just feeding off of each other’s energy
crackerjack3195,"Should I cancel my direct deposit into mutual funds? In December of 2017 one of my friends referred me to his father who works for a financial group in the area. I made an appointment with an investment advisor there and to keep this as short as possible ended up with him setting me up to where I have $100 automatically withdrawn from my checking account every payday and is split up between two different mutual funds. Their fee is $5 for every 100 that I invest. He also tried to sell me life insurance on my second meeting (which I declined). But since then it has just been regular withdrawals and I get a statement every month with my progress. Ever since I started following this sub, I’ve started to realize that I should never have gone with this group and the fact that he tried to push life insurance almost immediately should have been a red flag to cancel the entire thing. I am looking for recommendations on if I should just keep it set up like it is or close out the account, take out the money and start doing something else with my 200/month?"
crackerjack3195,Usually you will get approved for much more than you can realistically afford to spend. And I also wouldn’t rely on having roommates to help pay the mortgage. They’re not always going to be there and you will have some periods where 100 percent of the bills will fall on you alone
crackerjack3195,Mutual funds Some of you all might remember my post a few weeks ago about how I realized I chose the wrong broker to help me invest some money. Since I saw the error of my ways I have tried to get in contact with my broker to stop making automatic withdrawals and he appears to be ignoring my calls and emails. My question is (and sorry if this isn’t the right place to ask): would I be liable for anything if I just simply called my bank and told them not to authorize any more withdrawals from this company?

My email address is (first initial)(second initial)(last name) and that's what I use for 90% of my user names on my various accounts and websites. I like sticking to that cause I know I'll never forget it, and I hate having to keep track of a slew of various user names. Is it truly important to use a non-identifying user name? Or can I disregard that suggestion from freetaxusa.com? Thank you! 

P.S.
Follow up question: Will I need to transfer anything from my previous years' taxes with taxactonline.com?"
KatKali,"Is it ""normal"" to have so many accounts in so many different places? In the past half year or so I've been really getting on my finance game, trying to get myself organized and on the right track. I'm realizing I have many accounts with many different institutions. Between my checking account, credit card, 401k, IRA, HSA, brokerage account, and soon to be opening a HYSA, I'll have accounts in 6 different institutions. Is this normal? Should I be trying to combine accounts into fewer places? Or does it not really matter so long as I can keep track?"
KatKali,"At what point (planning-wise) is it worth keeping funds liquid in a taxable account vs. a tax-advantaged account? We've all heard over and over about how putting your money into your tax advantaged accounts is the smartest move in terms of overall savings and growth potentials. And of course there are ways to get your money out of a retirement account early. However, what's the time frame (i.e. 5 years, 8 years, 10 years) in which it'd make sense to keep your money in a taxable account instead for the sake of liquidity? For example, if I know I have a big purchase ahead of me, maybe a car or a home or whatever it is, how many years out should it be in order for it to make more sense to keep money in an investment account vs. a retirement account? I feel like I really understand the idea of saving via tax-advantaged accounts, except I don't understand how to balance pure saving with necessary spending. Thanks for any info and/or insight!"
KatKali,"Ah, that makes sense. Can HYSAs be connected to a credit card in order to pay off charges?

KatKali,"I always considered my checking account to be my emergency fund as it's the easiest to access. From my calculations I only need $3k-$5k to be totally covered for an emergency fund. This means now I'm sitting with $1k-$3k of excess in my emergency fund. 

Why do you suggest using a HYSA for an emergency fund? Is that common practice, as opposed to using your checking account for emergency funds?"
KatKali,"I'm freezing up when it comes to deciding what to do with my money. Last year I got the ball rolling on savings. Got a new job making good money for the first time ever. Opened a T401k, RIRA, and HSA. Maxed out 2018 HSA and IRA, moved brokerage funds over to Vanguard for that juicy VTSAX. Now it's 2019 and I don't know what to do. I know I want to max out my IRA and HSA again, but I don't know what to do with my other money. I could put it into my 401k (potentially even maxing it out, though that would be tough) which I know would be best for retirement. I could look into high yield savings accounts, which I currently don't know anything about, but that would be best for saving for a purchase in the next 5 years, like a house or a car. Or I could put it in my brokerage account. I don't know what's best for me, maybe because I don't know what my short-term plans/goals are financially, and every time I try to think about it or make a decision I just freeze up and end up not moving my money at all. I now have over $6k in my checking account, gathering dust and doing nothing for me. What do I do..."
KatKali,"My SO and I are thinking about combining our emergency funds into one account. We were thinking some sort of HYSA or other option that is liquid but will grow. Anyone have advice? Pretty much title. My girlfriend and I have been together for over 5 years and have lived together for most of those. I've been trying to spearhead some financial responsibility among us, including establishing emergency funds. Our thought process is that 1) the funds should be liquid (I think that's pretty much the point of an emergency fund), 2) it'd be nice to get some gains on the amount, so if not a brokerage account then at least a HYSA of some sort, and 3) if we are trying to eek out some gains, we might as well combine our emergency funds to have better returns. I don't know much (read: anything) about high yield savings accounts, so I'd love to hear some advice on this idea and this concept. Thanks in advance!"

Wellington_Yueh,"&gt; inadvertently affirm the debt and reset the 7-year (?) clock on your debt

This is just not correct.  The clock can be reset but only through court orders.  The debt is always based on the date of the original debt, you can't change that without going through the court to ""re-start"" the debt again.  "
Wellington_Yueh,"When I was dating my now wife, I was very honest with her about money and why I had a budget on how much I would spend on entertainment and going out.  If there is something big we would like to do, then we plan for it so I can save up the money.  She was perfectly OK with it and we have been married for 30 years. 

So set a budget and don't deviate.  "
Wellington_Yueh,"If you trade in your Sentra, you will end up buying a Civic for $25,000, $20,000 plus the $5,000 you will still owe on the Sentra after the trade-in.  That's assuming the dealer will even give you $6,000.  Instead of a $11,000 outstanding balance, you will end up with a $25,000+ outstanding balance.  

If the transmission is the only issue you have had and it has been resolved, then just keep it.  Make additional payment to the principal amount and try to pay it off early. "
Wellington_Yueh,"I added them to my AMEX and CHASE credit cards.  I didn't bother with any limits because they never have access to the cards nor account.  

By adding them to my credit accounts, it increased their credit age and total available credit which lowered their utilization.  Both helped to boost their credit scores. "
Wellington_Yueh,"Just one for the two of you.  As always, gather all the w-2s, any 109* forms you may have and start.  Any online software will guide you through, easy stuff.  Assuming your tax is simple and you don't have any crazy deductions. "
Wellington_Yueh,"&gt; Or will my interest fall immediately because there's less interest on less principle?

You save on interest by paying off the house sooner either by making extra payments or make payments directed at the principal.  Use an amortization schedule calculator and see how much interests you are still paying each payment.  Rough calculation will show that after 12 years of payments, you are still paying close to 60% each month on interest.  So the sooner you can payoff the house, more interest you will save. "
Wellington_Yueh,"If you pay the debt in full, then it would fall off your credit report in 7 years and they would put a note as ""settled"" for that collection.  

If you have the means to settle it, it's in your interest to do so. "
Wellington_Yueh,"Do you have any credit score currently?  If you don't, then there is a good chance you would not be approved for a traditional credit card.  You might want to look into a secured credit card which will help you build your credit. "
Wellington_Yueh,"I've added my three sons to my credit cards as authorized users.  When the credit cards arrived, I shredded them so they don't have any actual access to the account.  They have no clue that I did it but it helped their credit immensely.  "
Wellington_Yueh,"It will only benefit if you make arrangement for the collection company to remove the note after you pay it off.  

&gt; Ive read that after 7 years it gets written off anyway. So should I just wait until then?

The collection can go to the court and get a judgement against you and this court order will reset the clock based on the date of the order.  So in reality, this debt can follow you forever should the collection company wish to go after you. "
Wellington_Yueh,"The collection will stay on your record for 7 years from the original delinquency date.  After 7 years, the collection is removed from your credit report.  However, the collection agency may obtain a judgement on the debt and if they are successful in getting a court judgement against you, it will re-start the 7 year clock and this can go on. 

My suggestion is to negotiate with the collection agency and agree on a repayment amount for the deletion of the collection from your credit record.  Unless you want that collection on your record for 7 years and potentially longer.  "
Wellington_Yueh,"If that's the case, then I would certainly speak with my manager regarding my concern.  Since you have been there 4 years, I would expect your salary to be higher. 

Have you received any performance review in the past 4 years? "
Wellington_Yueh,"Yes, these are true.  However, if the debt is still currently on your record, there is no way to reset the original date of the debt. 

The links you have provided were not clear.  To make it clear, you may accidentally ""re-start"" the clock after the debt is expired.  So if you have an old collection that had already expired, acknowledgement of that debt can re-start the debt.  But if your debt has not expired yet, you can not reset the clock, meaning, changing the original date of the debt. "
Wellington_Yueh,"&gt; Also I can't file for unemployment since it was my own fault for being late correct? I live in California.

If you were fired, all 4 of the following statements must be true to make you ineligible for unemployment. 

1.  You owed a ""material"" duty to the employer. This means a duty that is properly part of the job (this can be, for example, showing up for work and performing your job duties).
 
2.  You substantially breached that duty (in other words, you didn't perform the duty). A minor or one-time transgression isn't enough to disqualify you from receiving benefits.

3.  Your breach of the duty showed a wanton or willful disregard for that duty. In other words, you weren't just careless or thoughtless but, instead, intentionally violated the duty or showed a reckless disregard for the consequences of your breach of the duty. Inefficiency, inability to perform the job, or good faith errors in judgment don't meet this standard and won't render you ineligible for unemployment benefits in California.

4.  Your breach of the duty must tend to harm the employer's business interests.


Based on the fact that you didn't have a reliable way of getting to work, maybe #3 doesn't apply.  I would still apply for unemployment and see.  You might be able to get it.  

Good luck!"
olidin,"I would like to point out that 35k isn't ""free"". I still have to pay interest rate on the 35k (at 3.75% or so) since I rolled that into the loans.

olidin,"10% Down or 20% down to save escrow and avoid PMI? Or invest the difference Hello, 

I'm working with a lender and I trying to find out the optimal course of action regarding the loan. Here are some details. 

Purchase 350k

Rate: 3.76% locked in. Conventional loan

Downpayment: 10%

PMI: $60 / month

However, I'm required for escrows (estimated at 10k a year or more) because I have less than 20%. Here is my question, **with such low interest rate, I would like to borrow as much as I can. However,** **is it worth it to put down 20% instead to avoid PMI and have control of my escrow? Which one is financially better?**

If I have no escrow and save to pay my own taxes (I'm quite good with finance and very discipline financially), I will earn 200 a month assuming a 4-5% return. That is in addition to the $720 a year save in PMI. 

On the other hand, if I keep 10%  (35k) in the stock market, assuming a 5% return, I will have $1,700 extra a year while the amortized interest I have to pay for the year on the 35k is $980, I made a profit of almost $700 a year and now have more liquid cash flow."

olidin,"People are giving you a lot of crap for a 40k purchase of the van... 

From your financial situation, looks like you made a good decision to avert the consequence of buying a house a bit hastily and needing to move now. It could be better, but what's done is done. I'm overall impressed with your quick handling of the situation.

People here are a bit too calculated and completely missed the big picture of life (e.g. ""Dogs are expensive! I rather loves nothing than pay for a dog!""). I do that sometimes.

Considering that you rented out your house and made a profit on the house, you have a bit of a win. Some last comment, I highly recommend you start considering:

* Tax bill end of year. Knowing that you are in the military, you might have some advantage in tax. But the fact that you rented out your property, it means your bill can be pretty high if you are not taking the proper deductions for land lording. Start thinking about a CPA who can help you optimize for taxes (pretty involved).
* Major repair. This house is not a new built so you are in for some big repair (I learned this the hard way with a 30k plumbing repair on the horizon already). Budget for that. You have 70k saving, cool, that can shrink pretty fast.

Your current rent of $2,350 is not enough to cover the operating cost of your house. Mortgage is only a small bill compared to operating cost. Over the course of the next 5 years, you'll find your self bleeding cash. Don't want that while you are dealing with a new baby. So, considering selling the house after the lease expire? This might work our better for your situation. 

I know your have other priorities in life, but renting out this house, even though it free up your cash flow now, does not mean you are out of the water (yet).

Otherwise, congrats on the new kid and new van.

olidin,"I opened up an investment account and instead of making payment to the card and I just let the balance build. Here is my experience:

1. It's not as effective if your card gives other benefit than just the 0% APR. For example, if your card also give 2% cash back and 0% APR, if you take advantage of the 0% APR, then you can't really take the 2% cashback since you will quickly fill the card limit and then end up not being able to churn money through the card (build balance, pay off balance, repeat) to get that 2% cash back. 
2. The return isn't that good. I assume your strat is instead of paying the card, you just invest the cash. The rate of return of even a 20k limit for a full year is probably at 6% in stock market or $1,200. But you only get that if you have an expense that would have cost you 20k anyway, and you put that on the card to defer the expense. In effect, you have an opportunity gains of 6%. So this is like a saving account starting at 20k and gain 6% for the year! However, if you don't have a big purchase, and slowly building this 20k via normal expense, your opportunity gain diminish. The gains would be similar to having a 6% saving account starting from zero, about half the gain.  

So long story short:

1. Zero APR card is only effective if you have a huge expense coming up and would like to defer the expense and have an opportunity gain. 
2. If you go with a zero APR card, then go for a card that a) has the longest period (18-24 months) and or b) very high limit so you can borrow as long as you can, as much as you can. Ignore other features since you cannot take advantage of anyway. 

If you don't have a big expense, I wouldn't bother with it. 

Good luck."
olidin,"Real estate in portfolio can be accomplished WITHOUT a house. This is important.

When you look at houses, they call it an investment but it is not the same as investing in the stock market. A house alone, especially a primary residence, is objectively a significantly disadvantaged investment as an asset class for several reasons:

1. A house is the only asset class where the acquisition and liquidation costs (i.e. closing costs) are significant. Buying and selling stock costs you $9, buying a house costs you 3%-10% of asset value.
2. A house cost to own is significant (i.e. maintenance). Maintenance of 1% of the total value (not equity) is like buying stock with 4%-10% management fee. 

Just these two alone makes it inferior as an investment when better alternatives exists such as REIT where neither disadvantages mentioned above exists. This is why we never buy an empty house and leave it vacant (except for the Chinese where there are literally no other alternative so they buy a house and leave it vacant).

So if you purely wants to diversify, do something else.

Now, let's turn the questions a bit differently. Can a house be a good investment? There are two cases when they are:

1. The asset is revenue generating with a positive rate of return (i.e. rental property or a property that appreciate via local market or forced appreciation via ""flipping"").
2. It serves a purpose to full fill a need for your life where alternatives to fullfill this need is more expensive (we are talking about opportunity costs here). In this sense, it would be the same as ""is this mac computer a good investment?"", the answer in this case depends on the person and its role in that person's life.

For case #1, I don't expect that would be you unless you are planning to be a landlord or house flipping so that's out. What you are left with is a big bet that your local rental markets returns well. That's a bet you can make. But it's risk profile is so different, you can't really predict. 

For case #2, the mindset is different. If you are just watching youtube, then a mac is a terrible investment; a small tablet might serve you better. But if you are a professional photographer needing some pretty accurate color on your computer for work, then hell yea, that's the best investment in your arsenal.

See how's there a bit of a difference here? There is already a need for the asset as a utility, and this utility makes the asset a good investment. In other words, if you need a house, then a house can be a good investment compared to the other alternative of living (you always gotta live somewhere). But if you don't need a house, a house is not going to be a good investment for you since you have no utility for the house (and also a terrible asset class).

So buy a house when you need a house, like buying a computer when you need a computer. But don't buy to diversify (that's like saying buy a mac computer and hold it for the value). It's not really an asset class that is comparable to stock and bonds and therefore should not be considered as a mean to ""diversify"" portfolio.

There are other perspective on using real estate to get access to tax deductions, generate revenue, and access to leverage to get appreciation. However, all of those things comes after you have decided that you indeed need and or want a house. If you don't need or want one, those advantages cannot offset the disadvantages listed (at least at the current climate where alternative exists)"
olidin,"I am looking in the Austin market as well and I understand your dilemma. Folks think that 540k is huge in Austin but it won't get you that far.

What area are you looking at? Have you considered from older home options? Renovating is perhaps the compromise you can make here.

And as for a return. I would not count on market return as high anymore for the next few years. The Fed has announced a slow down of interest raise but remains adamant that it will rise. Election cycle will come up soon in 2020 and we are facing a far more volatile market than we did in 2016. Last year, we had 2 biggest down fall of stock in decades (feb and Dec), we are overdue for a down market (not saying Austin will see it, but national stock market is on a different pace).

Counting on your investment to return seems risky to me. Personally, I'm buying because I want to shift asset AWAY from the stock market. "
olidin,"I haven't seen any suggestions here regarding \*renting a room in someone else's house\*. You understand the mechanics of communal living and this is a great advantage and skill. Many people cannot swallow or comprehend how they can live in someone else's house in harmony. 

From my personal experience, renting another room in someone else house is a great way to save money (I have done so for 5 years and saved a ton, and just bought a house on that saving). Home owner often will not push for higher rent since their mortgage are cheaper than apartment operating cost. Often, they are just happy to have a great renter and person to live in the house. I'll say, some home owner give me deep discount to get me to live in their house since I'm a good renter and roommate. 

If, and this a big if, you are only considering buying a house just to manage monthly payment, you are far better off renting a room in a house. You enjoy (1) the flexibility of renting and (2) the lower payment of a house that most home owner is able to pass to you via lower rent compared to apartment. 

If a house payment of $900 (not including repair or initial closing cose) while rent apartment in the area is $850, you are better off renting. And I bet you someone will be happy to rent out a room for $400-$500 in your area. 

Lastly, an apartment with a roommate is a good option as well.

DougeryThuggery,"Not sure how to proceed with collection agency... So, I’m not too sure where to go from here, and I couldn’t find a specific answer on the Wiki; so I wanted to follow up here.

I’ve recently been working on getting a collection removed from my credit following the instructions in the Wiki.

I started by asking them to stop contacting me by phone, and to communicate only by mail. I then sent them a debt validation letter via classified mail, that was sent on the 19th of February and delivered on the 22nd. 

I received a letter back from them dated Feb 23rd that said, “Please accept this letter as confirmation that [AGENCY] will no longer pursue collection of this account and will return it to [HOSPITAL WHERE ORIGINAL DEBT WAS INCURRED].”

I took this to mean that I would be able to get the debt removed from my credit reports, so I filed a dispute with Transunion from Credit Karma, and they came back very quickly that the information meets FCRA requirements and that it would stay on my report.

Note: I have not yet disputed this with the other bureaus.

1. What are my next steps from here?
2. Was I wrong in my assumption that this should be removable from my report at this point?
3. Transunion gives me the option to file an investigation. Should I do that, is there a cost involved if I do that? Or would it be futile?

realtordotcom,"As you may already know, a reverse mortgage is different that a standard mortgage.  In lieu of making monthly payments on the debt; the lender either issues your parents a monthly stipend amount or it would appear, in this case, that they make have taken a lump sum payment when they opened the loan.  Either way, the mortgage balance continues to accumulate interest which the lender earns using equity in the home.   At the time your last parent passes on or when they both move out of the property; the note becomes fully due and payable.  The lender will do a calculation at that time of the amount that has been disbursed and the current value of the property.   

It is possible that the total balance due may exceed the current value of the home.   The reverse mortgage protects the estate in that if there is a deficiency balance, it cannot be passed on to the heir.  The lender should offer the estate the option to pay the deficiency balance to retain the property or to assign the property to the lender at which time the loan would be considered paid.  If there is positive equity in the home; the lender should offer the estate the option to refinance the amount owed into a forward mortgage, to sell the property and payoff the lien through the sale, or to assign the property to the lender.  

Regardless of which scenario applies, you should know that the property does not automatically transfer to the lender which is a common misconception about reverse mortgages.   Your parents will or estate planning document will designate who inherits the property and the executor or the person that receives the direct inheritance will be able to work with the lender to identify the best path forward, which should offer you options to ultimately transfer ownership of the property to your brother."
realtordotcom,"Hi, 

Lenders will consider both your current and historical earnings when assisting you in qualifying for a new home loan.   Different mortgage products have different guidelines, but you are correct that almost all products will universally look at the most recent two years of historical earnings as an indicator of the amount and stability of your future earnings.   

However; your specific situation is a bit unique.   Generally a lender will be more willing to calculate your qualifying income based on your current earnings, even if it has substantially increased recently, if your new higher earnings are likely to continue at that level.   One example would be a physician that has just completed their residency and has now joined a practice at a much higher salary.   The same principal could be applied to your situation as you progress from an apprentice to a journeyman.  

Your status as a journeyman and your on the job training as an apprentice would make it generally acceptable that you will earn at a higher rate going forward in your career  which would allow lenders to consider your current higher salary even though your historical income for the past two years has been lower.   The one item that will be crucial is the nature of your employment.   Most journeyman, and union-based tradesman in general, will experience periodic gaps in employment as you are assigned to specific jobs through your union affiliation.   

When you apply for a mortgage, the lender will consider your current position and likelihood that that salary will reasonably continue for at least three years into the future.   At the time of application; if you have accepted employment for a project that may only last six months before you move on to a different company to perform similar services; then the lender would likely not consider your new higher income as reasonably likely to continue and would average your current earnings with your prior year’s earnings.   However; if you accepted an open-ended assignment, for example with a large developer that was constructing multiple projects, then your higher current salary could likely be used to qualify you for a new home loan after thirty-days on the job. 

Hope this helps."
realtordotcom,"At this time, mortgage interest is a tax deductible item on your primary residence or second home and therefore this can be a helpful tool in reducing your taxable income.   However; the ability to reduce your taxable income is subject to the tax code and could change from year to year.  I would not recommend that you make a decision about a mortgage interest rate based solely on the desire to reduce your taxable income.   You should also know that recent changes to the tax code have limited your ability to deduct interest on a Home Equity Line of Credit and there is a general cap on the amount of interest you can deduct if your income exceeds certain thresholds.   In general it is recommended that you negotiate the lowest interest rate possible on a mortgage loan.   Based on how mortgage interest is applied and collected, the long-term cost of mortgage interest is significant and while you may see some tax savings from deducting this interest, in many scenarios those savings are less valuable than the amount of interest you ultimately pay your lender. -rdc"
realtordotcom,"There are a couple of different concepts in your question related to the mortgage qualification process.  Related to assets, the lender will consider all accounts in which you are a listed as an account owner.   In that respect, the accounts that you share jointly with your father can be considered as qualifying assets available to use for your down payment and closing costs.   

The lender will likely ask your father to provide a signed statement known as a ""joint access letter"" verifying that you have full access to the funds in the account.   This would only be required if he was not listed as a borrower on the loan application.   Related to income, the current arrangement that you have with your father providing you with an annualized distribution of $30,000 is a bit more complicated.  Technically this is not income, it is a gift of assets from your father.   In order for the receipt of these funds to be considered as part of your qualifying income for a mortgage loan; there would need to be a formalized arrangement between yourself and your father.  

For example, if he is living with you, you could establish a lease with an annual payment of $30,000.   Although the money he is giving you is available for you to use to make your mortgage payment, it is not considered income in mortgage standards, but rather assets.   

Unfortunately, without some formalized mechanism to document the receipt of these funds in exchange for something of value that you provide to your father; you will be limited to the loan amount that you can qualify for based on the income you receive from your employment sources.  However; if your father were to apply for the mortgage with you as a third borrower; then his income from his retirement account distributions can be considered and will increase your buying power. -RDC"
realtordotcom,"There are a few different ways your mother can approach this in respect to obtaining mortgage financing.  First, there are several traditional mortgage options that are available to consumers that do not have a traditional credit history.    A traditional credit history refers to the types of accounts you mentioned (auto loans, credit cards, etc.) The mortgage industry allows consumers to qualify for many programs using non-traditional credit history.   Non-traditional history refers to items that are paid regularly but do not generally get reported to the credit bureaus, such as monthly utility payments, rent or lease payments on her current home, or private insurance payments for a vehicle.  Typically, if your mother can document that she has made timely payments to three of these “non-traditional” sources, she will be able to qualify for a mortgage loan.   The key is finding a lender that offers what is referred to as a “manual underwrite.”  Most mortgage lenders have moved into automation and use software programs to analyze their risk when making decisions on extending mortgage financing.   In your mother’s case, these software programs will not be valid because they generally do an analysis only on traditional credit history.   There are many lenders that will offer manual underwriting options, but your mother should cover this when she begins to inquire with mortgage lenders about financing.  Her real estate agent will also likely be familiar with this and may be able to help refer her to a mortgage company that is experienced with his option.

A second option would be for your mother to apply with a co-signor that does have traditional credit.  If you or another family member that has a traditional credit history make application as a co-signor, then your history can be analyzed by the automated software and then supplemented by your mother’s non-traditional credit history.   This option is also not a bad idea for estate planning purposes.   Your mother is still young, but if she secures a 30-year mortgage, it may not be paid in full when it is time to transfer the property to her estate and it can simplify things with the mortgage lender if there is another person obligated on the loan.

The final option would be to have your mother start to establish traditional credit now.   She can likely get one or two credit cards fairly easily.  Consider one major credit card such as Mastercard or Visa and one in-store credit card from a major chain.  It generally does not take long for the accounts to begin to report her history to the credit bureaus and with 3-6 months of on-time payments, she will likely have enough history to generate a credit score and secure a mortgage using her traditional credit. -RDC"
realtordotcom,"Many items are negotiable when you are shopping for a mortgage.   There are two basic categories related to Closing Costs:  prepaid finance charges and pass through fees. Prepaid finances charges are generally the fees that can be negotiated while pass through fees services are fees for items that the lender must order from a third-party and for which the costs are passed through to the borrower at closing. Pass through fees are not generally negotiable with one major exception being fees charged for Title and Settlement Services. By law, those products are services are fees that you as the consumer can shop for in order to find a lower cost.  The lender likely has a preferred service provider for title and settlement services, but you may want to check with other title companies in your area to search for lower costs.  The most common items that you cannot shop for are the fee charged by property appraiser to provide an opinion of value on your home, the fee charged to the lender to access your credit report, and any government fees assessed for recording legal documents or taxes assessed for transferring ownership of a property.  Outside of the pass-through fees, you can and should attempt to negotiate the prepaid finance charges with the lenders you contact about your loan. Items such as Origination Fees, Processing Fees, Underwriting Fees, and absolutely the interest rate are all negotiable.

After making an application with a lender, the lender is required to provide you a written document known as the Loan Estimate within three days. This document is universal in format between all lenders (as required by federal law) and should allow you to look at an ""apples to apples"" comparison of the various rates and fees that you may be offered.  

Choosing to finance your closing costs into your loan amount is generally a convenience preferred by consumers when they refinance their home, but you are absolutely correct in that it increases the interest paid on the loan.  If you are in a financial position to pay your closing costs out of pocket; then it will be a smarter financial decision.

The topic of paying discount points for a lower rate is a little bit more complicated.   Consumers that intend to keep the loan for the entire term and continue to own the property for twenty or thirty years will benefit more from buying down the interest rate.   Consider a $100,000 loan amount in which you agree to pay a 4.25% fixed interest rate for a thirty-year repayment term.   The total interest paid on this loan, assuming that you do not make any extra payments, would be approximately $77,000.  The same loan amount and term at 4.000% would cost approximately $71,870 in interest.   The decrease in interest costs over the life of the loan is over $5000.   Assuming you paid a 1% discount point of $1000, you have saved $4000 over the life of the loan.  However; if you refinance the loan or sell the property before it matures, you would realize less savings and the cost upfront may be less beneficial.   Consider accessing a free amortization calculator online and run the different scenarios you are considering to compare actual savings versus actual costs to determine if the upfront cost meets your savings goal.  There are many available online and most are very user friendly allowing you to input a loan amount, interest rate and term to determine the annual and life of loan interest costs.

realtordotcom,"The answer to your question will mostly depend on how you earn your income.   If any of the qualifying income you submit to your lender is generated through self-employed sources from businesses you own or independent contract work that was paid to you on a Form 1099; then the lender will likely require you to submit your most recent two-years of tax return documents.  Tax returns are also often required if you are qualifying with income from Social Security, Pension Awards or other types of income that are reported on a tax return other than normal wages which are paid to you on a W-2.  At this time that would include your 2017 returns.  In this scenario the lender would most likely decline your application when you informed them that you had not filed your 2017 return.  If all of your income was generated from a wage earner job and reported on a W-2 Form; then you will likely only be asked for your most recent 1 or 2 years of W-2 statements and the issue of not filing your 2017 return may never come up.

You mentioned that you are applying for a conventional loan which almost certainly means that the lender you are working with will require you to sign an IRS form known as a 4506-T, which gives the lender permission to request transcripts of your most recent tax returns directly from the IRS.  The requirement for you to sign this form comes directly from the agencies that issue guidelines for conventional mortgage (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac).   The lender is not required to process the form, but is required to have you sign it.  Each lender makes their own decision as to whether or not they actually process the form with the IRS; however, if they do process the form it will verify that the IRS has no record of receiving a tax return from you in 2017 and again the lender would likely decline your application for this reason.

You should know that when you complete your loan application, there is a specific question on the application that asks if you are ""presently delinquent or in default on any Federal debt or any other loan, mortgage, financial bond, or judgment.""  Your answer to this question will be reviewed by the lender and if you answer YES; then the lender is required to ask for an explanation and your answer may also cause the lender to deny your application.

In order to avoid any complications with your mortgage transaction, it would be good advice that you file your return now and work out a payment arrangement with the IRS if necessary.  Should the issue come up during the mortgage process; your proactive late filing and attempt to make payments, if applicable, will provide your lender more opportunities within the guidelines to approve your loan."
realtordotcom,"There are two separate issues related to your question. The first deals with the funds that your Father-in-Law will be providing for the down payment on the new home. These funds must be treated as a gift for the purpose of the mortgage transaction. You have indicated that he will not be applying as a borrower on the mortgage loan and therefore any funds he provides towards the purchase of the home would need to be documented as a gift.  This will require your FIL to sign a letter indicating that the funds do not have to be repaid and to disclose the source of the funds including the account number. Some lenders may also require a copy of the most recent bank statement for the source account to verify the availability of the funds. The only alternative would be for you to enter into a formal loan agreement with your FIL, which must be secured by an asset other than the subject property, and you would then be required to qualify with a monthly payment on those borrowed funds. A signature loan or unsecured loan will not be acceptable to the lender.

The second issue is adding your FIL onto the Title to the property to secure his ownership. In order to facilitate this request, your FIL will need to be listed as a party to the Sales Contract. Each lender may approach this differently based on internal policies. Some lenders will not allow non-borrower entities to be listed on the contract or the title.   However; you may add your FIL to the title at any time after closing. Assuming your FIL is comfortable with this arrangement, that is a much easier method that may simplify the mortgage process.  After you close on the purchase of the home, the Title Company and/or Settlement Agent can help you prepare a legal document known as a Quit Claim Deed that will allow you to add your FIL to the title of the property.  You will be given options regarding the legal classification of ownership to secure your equity and his equity in the property.  A common option in Florida is ""Tenants in Common of Residential Real Estate"" which should allow you to designate a percentage of ownership for each individual."
realtordotcom,"There is really no advantage or disadvantage to the timing of opening a new card after you open a mortgage.   It is not advisable to open any new accounts while you are in the middle of the mortgage approval process.   Mortgage lenders are generally required to certify all of the debt you owe at the time your loan closes and have various approaches to monitoring changes to your credit report during the mortgage underwriting process.   Opening a new account before you close on a mortgage will likely require the lender to request additional paper work from you and the new debt would need to be considered in the overall mortgage loan approval.   The lender cannot prevent you from opening a new account, but the process to verify the new debt can take extra time and may delay your closing date.

After you close your mortgage loan, you are correct that there are some implications regarding how new debt impacts your credit rating.   First, each time you authorize a company to access your credit report, which is likely a requirement to apply for a new credit card, that company will register an inquiry on your master credit file and each inquiry can decrease your score a few points.   This should not be a major concern unless you apply with several credit card companies at the same time.   The decrease to your score should be temporary assuming you continue to make all your payments on time.   All new debts appearing on your credit report will have some impact as new debt is treated differently in the scoring models than more seasoned accounts.   However, the impact is based on many complicated factors including the total number of accounts that you have, the average time the accounts have been opened, and the total amount of outstanding balances on installment (mortgages, auto loans, etc) and revolving debts (credit cards).  Based on your current excellent credit rating, you should not expect a major negative impact to your score and any impact would rebound as you began to make payments on the new debt.  

Generally, your bank should not be able to prevent you from moving your money from one institution to another during the mortgage process.  It is possible that you have been approved under a special mortgage product with your bank based on your depository relationships, but generally compliance regulations would prevent your bank from changing the interest rate that you locked after it was disclosed to you.   You should be cautious of moving the money during the mortgage underwriting process only due to the fact that the lender may require additional documentation before closing to show your availability of funds and it can be more complicated to supply the requested documents on a newly created account."
realtordotcom,"It appears that the Loan Officer may be advising your significant other based on outdated mortgage guidelines.   I am assuming that you applied for a conventional loan product.   Many years ago, it was a common practice in the mortgage industry to require borrowers to close any account that was paid-off in order to qualify for the loan.   That guideline changed and the standard guidelines that most lenders follow no longer require the account(s) to be closed.   The guidelines I am referring to are issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which are the two agencies that set mortgage standards for conventional loan products.   The current guideline specifically states ""If a revolving account balance is to be paid off at or prior to closing, a monthly payment on the current outstanding balance does not need to be included in the borrower's long-term debt.  (Note: credit cards are considered to be revolving accounts because the balance is revolving up and down month-to-month) Such an account does NOT need to be closed as a condition of excluding the payment from the debt-to-income ratio.""   This is the wording currently published in the Fannie Mae Seller's Guide which is a mortgage industry publication but is also available to the public at [www.efanniemae.com](http://www.efanniemae.com/).   I have provided a link to the specific chapter and section of the guide that includes the statement above.  You can share this with the Loan Officer:

You should now that lenders are provided discretion in applying more stringent guidelines to their institution and therefore it is within the Credit Union's ability to require the accounts to be closed as an internal guideline.  It is also possible that the pre-approval was provided on a special program unique to the credit union that is not covered by the universal guidelines shown above.  However; if either of those are true, I would recommend that you both inquire with other lenders.  The rate you were quoted appears competitive but also is likely available from many other lenders in your marketplace under similar terms.   Additionally, closing accounts can impact your credit score in a negative fashion in addition to the inconvenience of closing the card.-RDC"
realtordotcom,"There may be several opportunities to increase your buying power. Consider researching the following programs in your area:

1. **Alternate Mortgage Financing Programs:**  Self-Employed consumers face unique challenges in the home buying process.   Traditionally, lenders will ask to review your most recent one or two years of Federal Tax Returns and will do an analysis on your reported income to determine the maximum amount of money you can borrow.  The challenge is that most self-employed consumers take advantage of every legal opportunity available to decrease their taxable income.  The amount of taxable income shown on the federal form is not always indicative of the amount of income available to the borrower to manage their monthly mortgage payment.  There are certain specialty programs available to self-employed borrowers in which the lender will perform an analysis on your bank statements instead of your tax returns.   Bank statements can help develop a more accurate picture of your monthly cash-flow and may allow you to qualify for a larger mortgage.   You should be aware that this underwriting method carries a higher risk for the lender and the interest rates available for these products are typically higher than those offered on a standard mortgage.  You should be able to locate lenders in your area using an online search for ""Bank Statement Mortgage Programs"" or a more industry specific term known as ""Non-QM Mortgage Programs.”
2. **Equity Sharing Programs**:   Equity sharing programs are becoming increasingly more common in today's real estate market due to continuing increase in average home prices.   An equity sharing program is an arrangement with a private firm in which that firm will provide the consumer with extra funds to apply to a down payment in exchange for an equity share in the future value of your home.   Basically, this type of firm is gambling that your home will appreciate in value over time and is willing to provide you with additional down payment funds in exchange for a future payout when you sell the property.   There are several firms now offering this type of arrangement, but you should make sure that you have a full understanding of how the future payout will work before engaging in this process.   Particularly, what is your obligation to pay back the funds used for the down payment if your home does not improve in value as expected. 
3. **Down Payment Assistance Grants** \- Very few consumers are aware that most local and state governments offer down payment assistance grants to home buyers.  Most of these programs require the borrower to meets specific maximum income guidelines or to purchase a home in certain underserved markets.  You should research online ""Down Payment Assistance Programs in my Area.""  These programs have many different structures, but the most common structure will allow you to borrower additional funds for your down payment with no monthly payment requirement and a forgiveness option over time.  For example, you might be offered a $5000 grant to purchase the home and would not be required to repay the balance if you continue to live in the home for five years."
realtordotcom,"It should not be especially difficult for you to get approved for a mortgage loan simply because you have chosen to only have one credit card. Most lenders have adopted the use of standardized automated underwriting software.  These programs will analyze your entire loan application (including your income, assets, and credit history) to determine if you meet the common industry standards for responsible mortgage lending. Although you may only have one account reporting on your credit report, it appears as though you have done an excellent job of managing that account for many years and that history has been sufficient to generate a credit score. The presence of a credit score indicates that you have enough history for the credit bureaus to rate you as a good credit risk and that is an important factor for mortgage lenders. If for any reason the single card is not enough for the automated software to approve your loan; most lenders can offer you a loan based on a manual underwriting procedure.  In that scenario the lender may ask you for slightly more documentation which will include verifying your performance on other types of credit that do not normally report on your credit report.  This will include any rental history for your current home as well as other items such as utilities.  These alternative forms of credit should be sufficient to allow the lender to issue you a mortgage.  There is no reason to open additional credit in order to qualify for a mortgage loan."
realtordotcom,"Mortgage lenders do in fact subscribe to a different credit scoring model than the more generalized model that is available to consumers online.  The mortgage model places different emphasis on certain items on the credit profile that are most relevant in assessing how a consumer may perform on a mortgage loan. Prior mortgage history, for example, is weighted more heavily in the mortgage model than payment history on credit cards.  The score you are receiving on the Wells Fargo  app is likely a more generalized model. The credit score your mortgage broker disclosed to you last month is probably closer to the score any other mortgage lender will receive if you apply for a new mortgage."
realtordotcom,"The answer to your question is yes and no.  When you were prequalified for your mortgage loan, it was a qualification for a loan up to the amount you were provided; however, if you were to purchase a less expensive property, the lender would not advance you the excess funds.   However, there are many loan programs that will allow you to borrower the money necessary to purchase the home plus additional funds to complete home improvements.  

Eligibility for these programs will depend on the type and amount of work that you want to complete and the estimated value that those improvements will add to the property once they are complete.   These types of loans are referred to as ""Reno"" or renovation loans.  You will want to get back in touch with the lender you selected and ask about what options they have for renovation loans.   

The two most popular are the FHA-insured 203K program and the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation program.   If the lender you are working with does not offer these programs; then shop around with a few others and specifically ask about these programs.  They are under-utilized by consumers and are a great way to complete a home purchase will immediate equity enhancement."
realtordotcom,"The answer to your question largely depends on your current interest rate and how long you have been making payments on your current loan.  There are several things to consider:

1.  The percentage of your monthly mortgage payment that is applied to interest vs. principal is by design much greater at the beginning of your loan term than it is at the end of your loan term.   Mortgage interest is a simple interest calculation and therefore the more money you owe, the greater the amount of interest you owe.  As you continue to make payments, and decrease your principal balance, the interest portion becomes less, and the amount applied to principal greater.   Therefore, applying your lump sum to a recast may be more advantageous if you are in the first few years of repayment on the loan as the recast will lower your principal balance and therefore more of each subsequent payment will go towards your principal balance.   However; a recast will not decrease the total number of payments required on the mortgage; it will only change your minimum monthly payment.  If you have been paying on your current mortgage for ten or more years; you will probably be better served to apply your lump sum as a single principal reduction without the recast feature.   This will leave your payment amount the same but will give the same benefit of the recast in that your principal balance will be smaller and therefore the amount of interest applied from each monthly payment will be decreased. 

2.  It appears that your current loan payment includes a monthly amount for Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI).   Applying a lump sum payment will not automatically cancel the PMI.   Your rights as a consumer related to Private Mortgage Insurance are outlined in the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998.   You may request cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance Policy but you must do so with a written request to your servicer OR the lender is required to AUTOMATICALLY cancel the policy with no action required from you when the principal balance of the mortgage is first SCHEDULED to reach 78% of the original value of the secured properly.  The trick to the automated cancellation is that the SCHEDULED date is based solely on the initial amortization schedule for fixed rate loans.  This means that even if you make a large lump sum principal reduction which would reduce your balance to 78% or less of the value of the home when you purchased; the lender is not required to use that reduction to issue an automatic termination.   The original amortization schedule is based on the amount you originally borrowed minus your regularly scheduled payments.   Therefore, you would likely need to request the termination of the policy after you made your principal reduction.  At that time, the servicing lender has the right to review you request and consider things such as your payment history and the current market value of your home which may require you to pay for a new appraisal.  

A third option that you did not mention may be refinancing.  The benefit of refinancing will be entirely dependent on the interest rate you currently have on the loan; however, it might be beneficial to look at the cost involved with a refinance that would lower or keep your remaining term the same.   If there is a significant opportunity to lower your current interest rate through refinancing; then this may be the best option as neither a recast nor a principal reduction will lower the interest rate on your current loan.   A refinance has the added benefit that your current market value and loan amount will be used to determine equity and may cancel the need for your Mortgage Insurance policy as well.   Unfortunately, there is no easy answer to your question; however, there are several online free amortization calculators that you can find to plug in your loan specifics and determine overall total costs for the remaining term of your loan."
realtordotcom,"Truthfully, as long as only one of you claims the full amount, it is not likely that you will run afoul with the IRS.    

Tax advice should always come from a tax professional, but this is a topic that comes up very frequently with mortgage lenders.  You and your significant other can trade off on odd and even years taking the full deduction.   

My opinion: as long as the total amount claimed is not exceeded on one or both returns, you aren't doing anything wrong.  To your point, the IRS would be hard pressed to prove which of you paid which amount of interest.  -rdc"
realtordotcom,"The most important thing to understand is that construction loans are offered as a temporary financing solution.   After the construction is complete, almost every bank will expect you to refinance the construction loan into a more permanent financing solution.  Construction loans make sense for homeowners that want to make major improvements, but don't have enough equity available to finance the construction.  The construction loan allows the homeowner to finance improvements based on what the bank believes the property will be worth after the improvements are complete.  The construction loan is then refinanced using traditional loan financing based on the newly created equity from the improvements.

In your particular scenario, it appears that you have a good deal of equity in the property already and a construction loan is probably not the best option for you as you will have to refinance that type of loan after the addition is complete.  That leaves you with the other two option you mentioned:  your Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) and refinancing your current mortgage to cash-out your equity.   The HELOC is a less attractive option as it is tied to the prime interest rate which has been steadily increasing and is expected to continue in that direction.   A variable rate payment is not ideal based on current market conditions.   You could consider shopping for a fixed rate second mortgage, which does exist in the market place.   It will have a considerably higher interest rate that your first mortgage, but it will give you the peace of mind that your payment will fit your budget each month.  Refinancing your existing mortgage to access your equity is a solid option, but you may see a significant increase in your current interest rate as it appears that you purchased the home when rates were very low.  The rate increase is not ideal, but it may be the best way to accomplish your addition and keep in line with your monthly budget.  You can also investigate extending the term of that loan to reduce your payment.   I agree with your financial advisor that a 15-year term is always a good idea as long as the payment meets your budget.   

Related to your first problem, I 100% agree with you that a reputable contractor should be able to provide you with an accurate quote proposal based on the very specific improvements you want to make.   The internal finishing materials you select can make a huge difference, but if you ask for a quote based on the finish level you expect, the contractor should be able to give you an accurate estimate for labor and materials which you can then adjust to your budget.  "
realtordotcom,"The current monthly lease amount on the apartment you are renting and vacating when you purchase your new home will not be included as as debt in your debt-to-income calculation.  Most lenders acknowledge that even if your lease has not been fully terminated when you move into your new home; it is not a long term recurring debt that would have a significant impact on your ability to make your mortgage payment.  In most cases, you will not be required to make a mortgage payment on your new home in the month that you close or the month after you close, which generally allows individuals transitioning out of an apartment to make final lease payments.  You can exclude this payment. -RDC"
ArtoriusSmith,"Interest risk - if interest rates rise your bonds won’t be worth as much. Primarily a concern if you want to sell them before maturity

Call risk - if interest rates drop the municipality may chose to pay off the bonds early in order to get a better rate and you won’t be able to find other investments with a similar return

You can diversify with a municipal bond fund to get some protection, though then you’re paying an expense ratio."
ArtoriusSmith,"It’s worth getting the match even if it’s not vested. It’s not unheard of for companies to change their vesting policies from time to time so you there’s a slim chance it will vest earlier than you expect. A former employer of mine changed their bonus structure and in return immediately vested everyone’s retirement contributions.

It’s also something you can use as leverage for an increased signing bonus if you get another offer - I’d love to come work for you but I’m going to loose $6k in unvested retirement contributions, is there anything you can do to offset that?"
ArtoriusSmith,"They tend to be more expensive and offer lower return. What that chart doesn’t show is that the same $100,000 left in the S&amp;P 500 would be worth $165253 if it had been left alone during the down years (assuming dividend reinvestment).

There may be cases where it makes sense to have a portion of your assets in an FIA, especially later in retirement if you know you have certain on going fixed costs. Be very wary though, many financial advisors get huge commissions for selling them and their advice is not going to be unbiased. It may also be difficult or impossible to get out of the annuity if you later decide you want to do something else with your nest egg."
ArtoriusSmith,"Max out Roth IRA TO $6k. Get a high deductible health insurance plan and then max out an HSA. Keep track of all your medical expenses and don’t claim them until you retire.

Edited to add that there’s still time to put $5500 towards your 2018 Roth IRA. Depending on your income you may be able to do a traditional if that works better for you."
ArtoriusSmith,OP won’t pay the marginal tax rate on his 403(b) contributions. He’ll pay the effective tax rate on his total withdrawal (and any other income). If he has healthy Roth IRAs then he can draw those down first and just take out just enough from his 403(b) to cover the standard deduction and stay in the lower tax brackets. Then at 72 1/2 he’ll be forced to take withdrawals based on his life expectancy. Even then though the bulk of his money will likely be taxed at a lower rate so it’s probably worth it to keep some in the 403(b).
ArtoriusSmith,"Run the numbers again, this time consider a 22yd who’s able to invest the current 19k/year over their entire career and retires at 67. Neglect inflation and assume they stay in the same 22% tax bracket. By 67 they’ll have $6 million dollars in their 401k. For the first few years they take out $40k/year and do well by your plan. They delay taking social security but start that at 70 so now they’re 401(k) withdrawals are taxed at their marginals tax rate after social security. Then at 72 1/2 their forced to make distributions base on their expected life span. Let’s assume that’s 85. Now they have to withdraw over 400k/year which puts over half of their 401(k) withdrawals in the 32% tax bracket.

"
ArtoriusSmith,Likely the bonds still have the same serial numbers.  Give them a few more days to respond - they should give you instructions on how to prove your father is deceased and how to get the access codes for the bonds. You’ll need to create a TreasuryDirect account to receive them so you can get started by doing that. Because your listed as the beneficiary the process should be pretty straight forward once it gets started.
ArtoriusSmith,"This is a terrible idea. You won’t pay interest on the one dollar - you’ll pay interest on the entire balance. Most credit cards have a 21 day grace period between the statement closing and the due date. As long as you pay your balance off in full by before the end of the grace period then you don’t pay any interest. If you don’t pay your balance off in full then you owe interest on the entire amount of the balance, typically from the date you made the purchase."
ArtoriusSmith,That’s not strictly true. Often they’ll allow you to purchase the salvaged title from them. I used to drive a beater in grad school and it got hit with softball sized hail. The insurance company said they were going to total it but that I could repurchase it from them the total value of the car was $3300 before the hail damage and $300 afterwards so they just cut me a check for $3000 and we called it a day.
ArtoriusSmith,"You haven’t even come close to hitting the prime years of your life yet. Stay home and stack cash. Use some of the money you save living at home to go travel a few times a year in order to push yourself.

As a guy pushing 40 I’d say optimize your life so that you have maximum financial and personal freedom between 28-35. Your 40 year old self will thank you.
"
ArtoriusSmith,"Triage. Deal with the high interest credit cards first.

You can withdraw the principle from your Roth IRA at anytime (provided the account has been open for 5 years and your not withdrawing funds put in the previous year).

It may not make sense to pay off the debt entirely but you have significant equity in your house so you can probably get a home equity line or credit to pay off the cards. Then use withdraws from your Roth IRA as a last resort to cover monthly payments.

You could consider momentarily down sizing and renting a place while renting out your home for a year. That could cover a lot of your cash flow issues until you figure out what your commissions are going to look like."
ArtoriusSmith,"I typically quote at least  2-3 times my W2 hourly rate for contracting gigs depending on the duration and how interesting I find the work. I might make an exception and go lower if it’s a quick job that might generate more business later but that’s rare.

In addition to paying more in taxes you also won’t have unemployment benefits so you need to make sure you’re earning (and saving) enough so that you have a safety net between jobs."
ArtoriusSmith,"No. Financial advisors come in two flavors. The first gets a commission for getting you to purchase certain financial products - never use one of these. The second is fee only. These are good for people with complicated situations and significant assets. There are certain investment vehicles that only make sense to own when you have significant income or net worth and a good FA will know how to navigate that world.

At your age and likely net worth they aren’t appropriate. You can learn everything you need to know to manage your own money for now. For now focus on earning and keeping enough money that one day a FA will make sense for you.

"
ArtoriusSmith,"As long as you won’t be much higher than ~30% with the mortgage than it probably won’t make a difference. 

Also keep in mind that your home owners insurance may be higher if you have a restricted breed of dog (i.e. the kind many landlords won’t rent to)."
ArtoriusSmith,"There are two separate questions here:
1) should you open a Roth
2) should you put your money in a target fund

The answer to the first is almost certainly yes. You can open a Roth and put your money to any investment the institution you chose offers. This will almost certainly include a cash fund which is recession proof.

The second question depends on how certain you are of the future. As others have pointed out, time in the market has historically bear attempts to time the market so it’s probably wise to invest in a target date fund (or other low cost index fund or blend of low cost funds).
"
ArtoriusSmith,"It’s very common for places to prorate raises if you’re there for less than a year. If you’ve been there 7 months and they gave you just over 2% then you effectively got nearly the maximum raise (4%/year). Many places won’t even consider a salary adjustment until you’ve been there at least a year.

I’d advise against bringing it up right away - it sounds like you actually did ok and you may risk offending someone who went to bat for you to get you what you got.

Focus on continuing to perform well and if in a year or two from now you don’t feel like they’ve done right by you then start looking for another job."
ArtoriusSmith,"Do you have any concrete outcomes you can point to? Taking on additional responsibilities is good but ultimately raises and promotions follow from delivering tangibly in those new roles, not just doing them. Potentially being able to save the company millions is a lot different than having done it. If you don’t have anything you can point to with hard numbers it’s going to be a tough sell after only 6 months and probably come off as naive and possibly even arrogant.

In my experience you generally have to be performing at the level of the positing or salary you want for around a year before you can expect an actual promotion or raise. In the mean time your managers should be recognizing your contributions in lesser ways, e.g. investing in your career by paying for you to attend a seminar or with smaller awards. If those things aren’t happening you’re probably not on a road to advancement and either need to improve your visibility or find another job.

Why did you accept this offer in the first place if it’s so far below what you feel you’re worth?"
ArtoriusSmith,"What are the interest rates on your home, car, and student loans?

Generally, you want to pay off the highest interest rate debt first. If it’s a close tie may make sense to pay off the student loans earlier because those aren’t dischargeable in bankruptcy so there’s some risk reduction in getting rid of those. "
ArtoriusSmith,"The only rational I can see for doing this is that it would lower your current debt-to-income ratio and make it easier to secure financing on a home and may allow you to get a better rate. This would ultimately save you money in the long - even if the rate was slightly higher than your current car loan.

As other posters have said though - you’re in a pretty sweet spot financially right now.  Buying a home will deplete your savings and increase your monthly expenses significantly. Can you stick it out for another year or two?

"
ArtoriusSmith,"If you can’t get a 0% TF you can get a regular 0% intro APR card a few months before your current rate expires and just load up your expenses on that card and using your cash flow to pay off the expiring rate card.

The major limit to this strategy is that opening up new cards lowers your overall age of credit which lowers your credit score and reduces the likelihood you’ll be able to get new cards with the best rates in the future. Have a concrete plan for paying off the debt before you hop on the 0% APR treadmill!
"
ArtoriusSmith,"What’s the interest rate on your debt and what’s your income?

It may make sense to take out a personal loan if it’s at a lower interest rate than the debt. It can be hard to get approved for those when your debt-to-income ratio is too high."
ArtoriusSmith,"It does occasionally happen - someone cached a few fake checks against the company I worked for in high school. For that reason I don’t keep more than $1000 more than I have to in my checking account. Some banks will take cash out of your savings account so make sure your accounts aren’t linked or are at separate banks. That said, if you notice the forged check within the appropriate time period (usually 30-60 days) the bank should take care of it.
"
ArtoriusSmith,In that case the EPP is a little trickier but it’s still a good deal. You’ll get taxed differently if you sell the stock immediately vs holding for 1-2years so you’ll need to decide which approach is right for you.
ArtoriusSmith,"Do the stocks purchased via the EPP end up in your 401k? Generally EPPs in a tax deferred account are a very good deal. If you can sell the stock immediately than you can lock in a 17.6% return.

In general it’s not a great idea to be holding more of your employers stock than you’re obligated to. Stock crashes and layoffs are highly correlated. So yes, selling off your existing stock to pay down your debt is probably a good idea.
"
csdx,"I think you're not ready. That 35k isn't nearly as much a down payment as it seems. First set aside some of that money as an emergency fund that won't be part of a down payment. Then mortgages have origination fees around 1% of the list an, so that's another 5k you can't use for the down payment. Ideally you'd also want to set aside for repairs/moving expenses/starter furniture too. 

After all that, getting a house at that price point will likely cost you more than 2.1k a month once you factor in things like condo fees, taxes, insurance, not to mention irregular expenses like repairs."
csdx,"Try looking at it from the other side. Pretend you're in your new home all settled in, and have $55k (100-45) in cash lying around. Would you then take that money to put as a down payment on this particular home to use as a rental?"
csdx,"Put aside 25% before you do anything with it, stick it into a separate savings account and don't look at it, that will be used to pay taxes at the end of the year. While doing things like paying down debt is great, you don't want to spend it all then be looking at a $10k tax bill from the IRS. You'll probably owe less in taxes than that, but until you figure out just how much set that aside, then treat the extra as a big tax refund afterwards. 

After taxes are considered, put money in order debt, emergency fund, investing. Also a look at the [wiki page on windfalls](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall) may be helpful.

If you put your investing portion of the money into a Traditional IRA you can get a tax break on that money, though if you otherwise aren't making much money this year, you might do well to put it into a Roth IRA instead."
csdx,"I don't know if the new tax laws changed it, but you may still be able to do a backdoor Roth. Essentially even if you couldn't regularly contribute to a Roth, you could still do what you have done and fund a traditional IRA with post tax contributions then convert it to Roth.

Edit: if you just want your money out, you should be able to call the company an ask them if they can undo the contributions. It has to be setup specifically this way as just pulling money out yourself will count as a (early) distribution. Since you have until April to fund last years IRAs I think it should still be doable to unwind contributions as well."
csdx,"Credit scores are supposed to be a measure of 'will you repay the money you owe', and if you have behavior that correlates with someone who doesn't your score reflects that, it can't know the reason why, just what happened. Even if you have the money for it you had more than a full billing cycle to notice you had any amount overdue it and correct, but didn't. So that could represent a risk to a potential creditor that you might not pay them back on time just by failing to notice or ignore their bill.

Do you have any checkings or savings accounts at the CU? If so going into a branch and trying to ask again might get you somewhere, but if you don't it's not like they're possibly losing a customer."
csdx,"Refund is just the amount you've overpaid the government, if you can, check what the actual taxes owed by each of you are. It may be about the same for both of you, and you just had less withheld from each paycheck over the year."
csdx,"Those trial deposits require someone to expect it and then to verify them, so it's not something that PayPal would just do. Could be as simple as someone fat fingered their own bank number but, I'd call your bank ASAP and try to get a hold on it, or at least move money off that account ideally from say checking to savings in the same bank so it's instant.

Edit: if you can't call, do they at least have a chat/message system you could use to alert them to the issue?"
csdx,"Have you gotten a pay stub yet? No withholding allowances means more tax is taken out that you likely need, whereas no withholding would mean no tax is taken out at all (not sure if they can do this easily), and likely could get you in tax trouble if you let it stay that way

But just go ask to talk to payroll/hr again if you're not sure what they meant. It can be a bit embarrassing, but it's their job to deal with these things."
csdx,"Trade in is usually less than you can get if you sell it yourself. If you can get at least enough to pay off the loan,  go that route and buy your new car separately. It would be the same net effect just you'll have more money overall if you can sell for more than the trade in offer."
csdx,"Well then you should give it a shot, nice thing is that worst case you can always just sell the house. However, make sure to get the right kind of home insurance once you do start renting it out.

My personal opinion is based on the fact that I'm not much into landlording so would rather just dump the money into the stock market."
csdx,"I'm confused, getting co-signers off a loan is only for their protection not the borrower who remains on the loan. So can't he just make the payment in full for the month. That way it's paid on time and then if she pays late it's just to him. I can see that she's more likely to just miss payments entirely, but after all, once she's off the loan he'd have to pay for the full thing himself either way.
"
csdx,Unless you want to fall into the rabbit hole that is /r/churning. I'd advise just finding a good 2% fee free cashback card and using it for everything. Citi Double Cash and Fidelity Cashback card are the ones that come to the top of my head.
GNYC11385,"People are going to start flying in telling you PMI will ruin your life. I’m trying to beat them to it. My mortgage is $2760 a month and my PMI is $89 of that $2760. I sure wish I didn’t have to pay it but it beats paying the $2450 a month in rent for the next 5 years so I could save up enough little by little to put 20% down and avoid the $89 a month. 

Everyone’s situation is different. You have to make sure you can afford the payments and the upkeep. Whether you put down 3% or 20% you will need a large amount of cash to close. I’d say in the $25k range just for down payments and closing. On top of that you do need an emergency fund. "
GNYC11385,"My mortgage is $2740 a month. My PMI is $89. The Reddit financial experts on these forums will say things like ""PMI will eat you alive"" ""you're dumb if you pay PMI"". I wish I didn't have to pay it but it's a small drop in the bucket for what I'm paying. If anything it's more drive to get to that 20% with extra monthly payments and bonuses when I can put it towards the principal. If you can avoid PMI then by all means avoid it. What's dumb is continuing to pay $2450 a month for rent for the next 8 years so I can avoid paying my $89 PMI portion of my mortgage each month. "
GNYC11385,"I wouldn’t get too excited. I’ve had customers come into the bank with old inherited stocks they thought would get them loads of money only to get something like $48. I would definitely recommend like they said, unclaimed property but I wouldn’t get too excited about it until you do more research or you potentially could be setting yourself up for a large let down "
GNYC11385,They are going to expect you to generate a very difficult amount of new money leads. If you can't do it they will let you go. Unless you are confident in your ability to self source leads I would not recommend it. 
GNYC11385,"My only advice is that my wife and i put in some offers on some houses needing lots of work for what we thought was fair. We got outbid every time and stuck to our price and didn’t get into a bidding war. Then we found a house that needed to work other than yard work (torn down fences, i level ground, dangerous trees, etc) and we are so glad we didn’t do the ones that needed work because it’s been hard to find time with jobs and a baby to do even the simplest yard work we wanted to do. It’s getting done but at a much slower rate than we expected. If you can live with the house in the condition it’s in for a while then consider doing it. If not then I’d say pass"
GNYC11385,"Do you have another line of credit open you can balance transfer to? This may be your bigger problem. I’m not sure if you can balance transfer from a closed card but I believe you can, I can’t think of any reason it would be stopped. I work in banking and as far as I know a customer has never told me they were doing this, so people may be doing it and I'm not aware. Still, if you are thinking of applying for a new card to balance transfer to then you may have a problem with a debt on another card. "
GNYC11385,"I got my graduate degree for less than 25k and my work reimbursed me half of it. However unless you have a solid plan it may not be worth it. I got an MBA, looks great on paper, I make lots of money but I’m the only one of my colleagues that has one. I definitely didn’t need it for what I’m doing. I would say unless you really have a need for it to qualify for jobs you can’t get then don’t waste your time. Looking back I feel like I would have been smarter entering the workforce professionally and having 2 more years of experience at this point (I’m 30) rather than an extra line on my resume."
GNYC11385,For the pre approval it’s simple. You can even lie and get pre approved. But I recommend you get pre qualified. For this you would want to shop around more and find the best rate. If it’s your offer vs someone else that’s pre qualified then the seller will likely take the pre qualification because it’s less risky that it will fall through/may close earlier.
GNYC11385,Your pending charges will show up on your next statement cycle. As long as you pay the statement balance each time before the due date you should not be charged interest. You’ll probably have until June 1st to pay the $50 in pending charges before you are charged interest
GNYC11385,"This. Just purchased a house and my wife doesn’t work. She isn’t considered a borrower, it sounds mean but she had nothing she could contribute neither financially nor credit wise to this one particular transaction so she was left off. "
GNYC11385,"I’d say extremely risky unless you are a financial institution or have some way to recoup the loss if the person you lending to decides they can’t pay it back. That rate is more than double the going rate here, not every country is the same but that sounds way too high for the borrower to be financially savvy."
GNYC11385,"I agree, balance transfers can definitely help you. But you'll need to find somewhere that will approve you for another credit card with a high enough limit to balance transfer to. Maybe shop around and speak to some local bankers to see if it's possible to balance transfer to their card and then decide if you want to apply for another card there. I really don't think it will be an issue coming from a closed card. But that debt affects your debt to income ratio and will impact your odds of getting approved or not. "
GNYC11385,"If he has an adjustable rate mortgage eventually yes it will affect him. It can be hard for some people paying high rent to save enough for a down payment. That's why someone would finance with little or no down payment. Its likely not to the buyers advantage to finance it 100% though. The more you can put down, the better normally. It's very expensvie to buy a house. I just went through it and had to pay about $26 out of pocket for closing costs and the down payment. "
GNYC11385,"I moved to NYC with a $30k car that was paid off that I absolutely loved. Realized it wasn't necessary, sold it, used the money for a down payment on a house, bought a $4,000 car for family stuff/trips. Insurance is $72 a month with no car payment and have a driveway now so it just sits 6 days a week because I take the train everywhere. Very happy with this decision. "
GNYC11385,I understand how the rabbit hole goes. I had a similar situation where I’m going to get some money and my mind has gone from a small amount of expectations to a mountain of expectations lol. I hope it works out for both of us. 
GNYC11385,Your mortgage payment is going to be way out of reach for you if the houses are 450-500k and you expect your mortgage payment to be below $1600. You may want to consider moving and continuing to work for a while rather than retiring if you want to purchase a home. Retire and get your pension but get another job and move to a cheaper cost of living area and it may work where you can buy and retire after a few years.
GNYC11385,"I’m not as familiar with investments outside of the USA but here there is no one offering even remotely close to a 12% guaranteed return so that’s pretty amazing if that’s truly what it is. Banks here offer .08% on savings account, a long way from 12%."
GNYC11385,"You could easily buy a cheaper Sedan for $2-3k. Then sell it when it’s time to move. That’s what I would do. I bought a beer up suv in nyc last year fro $3300, it is possibly as long as you just need a vehicle that gets you from here to there and don’t need luxury."
GNYC11385,"Sounds like you may be a little mixed up. I’ve never in my life heard of an FDIC guaranteed APY of 12%. 2-3% would be pretty high. You might be speaking up rate of return on an investment of 12%, which would not be guaranteed, but would still be a very high rate of return."
froguerogue,"Do you have records of your talks with amazon, like emails? If your dispute with the bank was successful there might be paperwork you can show them.

Isonium,"Should I ask for a payment plan on unexpected and large medical expenses instead of depleting our emergency fund? Or is this the emergency it’s for? We have a 1 month emergency fund.  Unfortunately my wife has unexpectedly needed a lot of medical procedures this year and we have a high deductible medical plan.  I could pay it all immediately but it would deplete our emergency fund.  We would be in serious trouble if something else happened as we have no credit cards or other resources fall back on.

I can pay it over the next 3 to 6 months without using the emergency fund from my regular income, but it feels strange asking for a payment plan when I could technically pay it.

We took a finance class last year and that’s why we even have an emergency fund at all.  While the class told us to work up to a 3 to 6 month emergency fund, it made no mention about actually using it vs not using it."
Isonium,"There is no advantage of your name being on an account with her name on it, if that’s what you mean?  Remember for a creditor to garnish a bank account, or income source, they must have a judgment against her.  Assuming there are judgements and there is substantial debt, no or little assets, and you are only trying to protect income then bankruptcy may be an option depending on the income and ongoing expenses.  

There are also trusts and certain types of accounts that are protected from creditors (although many of the accounts require earned income and/or have age limits which will likely be an issue.) You may want to look at all options.  It can get complicated unfortunately.  I have had to deal with something similar, but had more flexibility because it was disability and there was earned income from a private disability insurance company."
Isonium,"You could have a conversation with them, however keeping in mind that IF they are supporting you for more than 50% then they can, and probably should, claim you as a dependent.  Be open and honest about how you feel but also consider what they are providing you.  Hope it all works out."
Isonium,Is it a good plan for $650?  Do you expect to need insurance?  Can you handle a large deductible?  These are all things to consider when shopping for a lower premium.  You might be able to get a better deal elsewhere or even on the ACA marketplace depending on what you need and your constraints.
Isonium,"Depending on how much you are over on your AGI you can potentially lower your AGI using contributions that lower your AGI.  Do the math and determine if you max out any 401ks or other AGI reducing plans (if you haven’t already) and if you contributed the rest of your combined limit to traditional IRA(s), would it put you under the AGI for being able to contribute?  If not, how about an HSA (if you have high deductible health insurance)?  If none of that will work and you don’t have any other way to lower your AGI you will need to remove the money from your ROTH IRA that you contributed so far in 2019."
Isonium,I hadn’t really even thought about the interest part.  And you are absolutely correct.  I am earning 3.5% on the emergency fund at my credit union so a 0% loan essentially means we make money and keep our emergency fund intact.
Isonium,"Oh wow, I hadn’t even thought of that.  I will check and see.  I did recently settle some older medical debt with a collection agency for a discount, but it didn’t dawn on me that might work with a hospital directly.  Even a 10% discount would make it worth paying right away."
Isonium,"This is pretty normal for credit unions.  Mine is 4% APY on first $2k then 1.5% on next $3k and downhill from there.  I have a money market and a checking that both get that deal.  So I get 4% APY on $4k total.  It’s cash I would keep there anyway, so win-win for me."
Isonium,"You most certainly signed an agreement to pay and it should list the details.  While the fact is you didn’t receive the service you paid for, you will need to consider is waiting an hour reasonable under the circumstances.  If not, then a chargeback may be appropriate.  However before you do so, I would request a refund in writing.  Your card company requires you to attempt to resolve the dispute first.  In writing is best, but unless you are running out of time for a charge back, put your ducks in a row."
Isonium,"While it is true that you can pull your contributions out of a Roth tax free, you cannot just put them back later.

However if you move all or part of your Roth IRA to rollover Roth IRA you have 60 days to do so.  This is called an indirect rollover.  Unfortunately a rollover with a check being send to you will result in 20% withholding by the IRS.  You would need to return the money plus the 20% within 60 days to rollover Roth.

You might want to look into home bridge loans that are designed for this very purpose."
Isonium,"Sounds like tax evasion and/or money laundering.  You want nothing to do with it.

For the record my sister and I once purchased a house without a loan.  Even though it was considered cash purchase it still went through escrow.  We had to account for the source of the money.

Also, if you do this, you will be considered renting the property out even if not rent changes hands, tax law can get tricky depending on where you are.  Plus property tax, insurance, etc..,"
jetiger,"If you can't manage 4, then you should probably be looking at a cheaper car. You can get a 6 year old corolla that's very reliable for around $6k. Overspending on a car is a common American thing to do that will suck a lot of money out of you. Read this: https://www.moneyunder30.com/how-much-car-can-you-afford

6 isn't too crazy, but you could do better - especially if you have good credit. I'd shop around at a few different companies for a loan. Aim for low 5s. https://www.bankrate.com/loans/auto-loans/current-auto-loan-interest-rates/"
jetiger,"I'd look into Vanguard for their mutual funds then. I've never used that tax patent before, so I'd do a bit of research on it vs ETFs before you start.

Small taxes don't seem like much, but they add up a lot over time, so it's a big decision "
jetiger,"Personally, I have 90 percent stock and 10 percent in a savings account. Most of the stock is in a total market etf, but there's also a good chunk in some lower volatility stocks like VYM.

Youll probably want to keep some of that out of the market in a savings account for an emergency fund. For 6 years out, I'd put the rest in a total market fund.

If you can't afford to lose any of that money AT ALL, then don't use the market. That doesn't sound like where you're at though "
jetiger,"If your bf has the same amount saved, you're 2/3rds of the way to a down payment! I'd guess you could save a few thousand a month on 200k, so it should only take a year or two to get the rest of the way. "
jetiger,"Depends on the type of investing you'll be doing. Vanguard has a patent that makes mutual fund investing more tax efficient. At other places, you would want to stay away from mutual funds since they would be taxed worse, you would have to do ETFs instead.

I personally use TD Ameritrade since I like their thinkorswim platform. I do more than just buy and hold though, so that might not matter to you"
jetiger,"Half of a comparable salary is probably a bit on the low end for an intern, but not a bad guess. I'd probably go 2/3rds, depending on how good you are at your job. If you're really good, go higher obviously.

$70k hourly is around $35/hour. I'd probably ask for around $25/hour.

This is in a high COL city though, and I never did internships there. $25/hour seems a bit low for SFO. "
jetiger,"&gt; save more for retirement * I’d like to max out the 401k and to do that I would have to deduct about 36% of my paycheck each month. Is this advisable or even possible to do?

Yes definitely possible. It's a good idea.

Really it all comes down to what you want to do with that money? You said possibly buy a house in 6 years. Assuming that you'll be using all the money as a down payment on the house, I would personally open a taxable account and put it in a total stock market etf like VTI. As you get closer to wanting to purchase a house (a few years out), I'd start switching it over to less risky investments like tax-friendly bonds, lower volatility blue chip stocks, high yield bank accounts, CDs, etc.

As I said before, the first thing you need to do is have a purpose for the money. When you can answer that question, it would be easier to give advice."
jetiger,"6 years is too long for a car loan. Keep it to 4.

The used car will be cheaper in the end due to less depreciation. The new car will be nicer. Are you willing to pay a lot more money for a nicer car?"
jetiger,"My wife and I are in a very similar position to you. That is our plan.

We keep an emergency fund of around $20k in a checking account, and the rest of the money we are saving is in a few different somewhat conservative ETFs."
jetiger,"&gt; My old job had me as a 1099 employee. I do not know why

If you think you should have been an employee instead of a contractor, then you should dispute it. The only downside is that your old company will know that it is you disputing it, but if you don't work there any more then it's probably not a problem? Here is some more info: https://www.dol.gov/whd/workers/misclassification/

The government will launch an investigation and determine whether you should have been an employee or not."
jetiger,"A few things to add here

1) SP500 return is 10 percent annually on average since inception. Taking the number from two years ago seems kinda weird

2) remember you have to pay taxes on capital gains from the market. Reducing interest that you are paying does not get taxed (unless you are claiming it as a deduction?)

The math here doesn't really seem to add up
"
jetiger,"Everyone is telling you to sell the car, but that doesn't really make sense at all. If it costs $10k to finish the lease and $10k to buy it out and sell it, just keep the car. It's the same price to have a car instead of not have the car.

You could try swapping the lease with someone else though, there are a few websites for that. "
jetiger,"Lots of resources out there on cars, reliability, etc. You can try here: https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/b2hfqw/weekly_what_car_should_i_buy_megathread/

Japanese cars are know for their reliability, particularly corollas and civics. You can probably find a $5k 2010ish corolla with a little over 100k miles. That's what I would do if I needed the cheapest possible reliable transportation."
jetiger,"To give you some context, I'm a big car enthusiast. I've bought expensive cars, taken them to the track, etc.

To me, owning a car for 9 months and then not using it is a bad idea. It's going to depreciate a lot while it just sits there and you don't use it. You'll lose money over time. 

Instead, I would get a cheap car now for 9 months. Once I am able to use the car again, I would take the money I saved and get the car I really wanted. Not only will you have more money to spend, but you'll be able to get a newer car too.

Or let's look at it another way. Buy a cheaper car, and then take some of that leftover money to use for fun. Go to a racetrack and rent a 720s. Go to another and rent a 488. And another to rent a Huracan. You'll still come out ahead and have some amazing experiences you can look back on the rest of your life."
pkogrt,The root cause? My risk? Doesn't sound judgemental at all. I prefer Banks with zero fees for such items. I would expect a bank like Charles with many good reviews to at least offer this as an option. Nothing to do with my finances or risks of of overdrafting. Thanks for your unwanted contribution. 
pkogrt,It's a Kia optima. I have no idea why in hell my buddy decided to get a Kia. He says he wanted one because one of his buddies had one and looked cool. A case of a child wanting the same toy his child buddy has. I need to look over the warranty. 
pkogrt,"Damn, your response is awesome. Both these parents are still legally married but have a lot of personal drama. 45k would be happy with little to no amount due while 20k wants to pocket as much refund possible. What a headache. I wish they would just file MFJ same as 2017 tax year. "
pkogrt,"I just learned that Charles Schwab doesn't offer a decline option by default for insufficient funds I just opened an account and was heartbroken to see a $25 fee for an insufficient/overdraft. My NBKC account will just decline the transaction and I don't have to worry about fees because they don't have any. Oh well, was that hard pull worth it? Maybe for the unlimited ATM rebates and 0 foreign transaction and free unlimited free standard checks. I would expect this to be an option at least.

One made about 45k the other about 20k one dependent is over 16 (17) what's the best way to file taxes for 2018? Have 20k claim all 3 dependents? To maximize refund? Split dependents?

LoveThyFood,"It didn't give much detail. All it showed was the date and the associated address, which is our home address.

LoveThyFood,"Capital One social security number alert My mom is freaking out because she thinks that someone may have used her SSN. She got a SSN alert from Capital One, and it shows that the associated address is my home address, which we moved into about4 months ago. I don't know what exactly this alert means, but I am really worried.

When my mom and I moved into this unit, she opened electricity account and water account on her name, which required her to submit SSN for soft credit check. She has a great credit score. I don't think it was the apartment that did any kind of credit check on her because she never provided one to her since I am the lease holder and she is listed as a tenant.

UPDATE:  

Ok, so my mom, being an absolutely illiterate in technologies and website surfing, didn't click the button that showed why the alert came. It said:

\&gt;An additional address have been associated with your SSN. CreditWise monitors credit header data from multiple bureaus and checks the names and addresses that are being used with your SSN

LoveThyFood,"Pre-approved for auto loan but ended up not buying Long story short, my mom applied for auto loan at Chase, and she was approved immediately. She has around 700 credit score. 
 However, they told me that it would only be for the specific dealer, and that it is valid for 30 days. So we went to the car dealership but came back because the car we considered buying was smaller than expected. SO...here is the question. 
1) If she wants to go to other dealers, should she apply again? 

2) IF yes, will that affect her credit score badly? "

diditvd,You wont reach 100k with those raises unless you ask for a promotion. I would look for a new job and not take anything less then 100k. Use it as bargaining and not take position unless get exactly what you want. 
diditvd,BI-Weekly Pay and Budget Issues I have been doing great with my budget and in the postive but barely. However with Bi-weekly pay I am always cutting it super close on waiting on that next pay and then its going out toward bills. What does everyone do that is living paycheck to paycheck bi-weekly do?  I feel like i need to get a whole paycheck ahead to have a buffer. Thats very hard when only rolling over a little month to month. Any input. 
diditvd,"Ive been using an excel budget spreadsheet from the sidebar and it has been amazing. Obviously more work since i have to key everything i spend in but its super simple and been a huge help. Would have to check which one it was again. 
Edit: its called poormans budgeting spreadsheet "

rapacityinblue,"If anything you’re doing them a favor by creating a legal childcare tax credit with none of the tax burden! 

There are plenty of articles on this subject. Keep your eye on the source, of course, because some of them are from nanny payroll services that have a vested interest in enrolling you as a client. 

Number one tip I have for you: never undervalue yourself. Childcare is not the place for a family to be cheaping out!! 

Good luck! "
rapacityinblue,"Your math only works if you compare the money to the cost of one lease. Over 9 years, you’re paying $27k on three leases. MSRP on a 2019 Camry starts at $23,600 and change. Let’s assume $25k after negotiation, taxes, fees, and heck, we’ll throw in seat warmers. No major issues and free 2 year maintenance, call it $5k additional over 10 years. That’s definitely at the high end, but whatever. 

Now, using KBB, in my area, the lowest priced 2009 Camry (which, remember, our fake Camry isn’t) in good condition (the majority of cars) has a trade in value of $3-4 k, and private sales for similar Camrys are in the 5-8s. Assume I’m trading in at a Toyota dealership for a 2019 Camry; I think we can comfortably negotiate up to $5k toward my new car, and a subsequent reduction of taxes (almost 9% in Chicago, ouch.)

So yeah, over 10 years my Camry cost me around $24,500, and bonus, I’ve been payment free for 3-5 of those years.  But it’s not even that, because I’m comparing the msrp of a 2019 Camry to the sales of a 2019. A 2009 cost less and in 2029 a 2019 will sell for more, presumably, so the difference is even larger. You can argue that the difference is minor, even accounting for the extra year on my Camry. Fair enough. It’s nice having new things. But you are paying more for that luxury. "
rapacityinblue,"Your landlord has no need for your full bank account number. You are well within your rights to redact it, since with a bank account number and a public routing number, anyone could transfer money out of your account.

You can usually ask your bank to print information with the account number redacted, and most banks no longer show full account information on online statements. "
rapacityinblue,"Buying used can be rough depending on where you live. You’re probably better off not leasing, but if you want a decent car for your family to drive, you’ll have to weigh an inexpensive new car (think Honda Fit or similar) against a used car with possible mechanical issues. Decent used cars are selling for significantly more than they used to, and you might have better luck reselling a 2 year old car as the first owner than a 7 year old car as the second. "
rapacityinblue,"2 totaled cars in 1 year (at fault for neither) 
1st was 1 partial payment away from being paid off, second was the replacement car and underwater thanks to depreciation and being less than 1 year old. 

When you call to negotiate, you can use the Kelly bluebook value, but also: 
 - have your purchase agreement and every single expense for the car you can document. Any sort of extended warranty/protection plan? That’s value added. If you recently had work done, even an oil change, you can negotiate that up. “Extras” you may not consider, like a third party stereo or new/upgraded tires. And make sure every single feature is accounted for. On our second car they missed the winterization package. Only like a $3k “value,” but every penny counted. When insurance values your car they’re working mostly off the VIN and guesswork; they don’t know any added value you’ve put into it. 

- current sale prices in your area. On my first car they initially lowballed me (like $6k on $7-8.5k value car.) I compiled a spreadsheet of the same make and model, all 25-30 cars I could find within 20 miles of me, and I noted every difference (mileage vs my car, features these cars had that mine didn’t and vice versa, etc.) I was able to show that in my area I couldn’t get back into the same car period, and anything close to similar was selling for $8-10k. Eventually they upped their offer to $7.5k. 

No longer relevant paragraphs below:

[Get checked out by a doctor. I walked away from my first accident feeling grouchy but fine. Whiplash injuries appeared 2 months later and started getting worse. I didn’t realize that I had blacked out and was dealing with post concussion syndrome for almost 2 years. It sounds unthinkable, but trauma and stress are weird af. 

Also: if your vehicle insurance has medical coverage, don’t uses it. Your medical bills will eat into any personal injury settlement you get, but if they’re all from one insurer (aka your health insurer) you’ll have more luck arguing them down. In the words of my lawyer, “you pay for health insurance, use it.” ]

Consider getting a lawyer. We’re three years out from my first accident and it’s in settlement limbo because insurance companies will run out the timeline to get you to go away. They’ll lowball you at every turn. A reputable lawyer can counter their plays. 

Sorry this is happening to you. Good luck!

rapacityinblue,"Unfortunately the answer isn’t one you’re likely to want. Stop and assess what’s really important to you, and how much you’re realistically able to spend on it. The first thing is to make sure you and your fiancée are both investing in a retirement plan and paying down debt. You also need an emergency saving fund, 3-6 months of expenses, before rings or vacations enter the picture. 

It’s time to start asking what you really want to spend your money on. How necessary is an engagement ring? Can you shop around for a vintage ring or repurpose an heirloom instead of buying new? Where can you save expenses on your wedding? I’m not going to be one of those people who insists everyone can get married on $50 — in our case, my wife has a very large family and getting away with a small guest list just was not in the cards. But we DIY’d our invitations, we held our reception from 1-5 pm and notified all our guests in advance that we would not be serving a full meal, and we spent $350 on non-traditional wedding dresses (combined). We had a firm budget of $1k for our honeymoon at Universal, including flights and hotels, which meant staying in a time share. And we didn’t take a big vacation again for 3 years. 

The TL;DR version is set a budget and invest in retirement accounts. But the much longer answer is sit down now and have a heart to heart now about how you want to manage your financial life together. "
rapacityinblue,"Insurance, pto, benefits, etc. do have a monetary value. 

Insurance — what would you pay for private insurance or to be on a spouse’s plan? You need this much annually to account for loss of benefits. If your current insurance has low out of pocket costs, make sure you add that in — a low monthly payment can be countered by 30% coinsurance. 

PTO - how many paid days off do you get on your current schedule? You don’t get paid if you don’t work as a contractor (usually) so figure out how much you’d need to get your hourly rate for 80 hours of vacation. 

Various retirement accounts — how much employer matching do you have? What would it cost you to invest privately? Are the interest rates comparable or are you getting a better rate through your benefits? 

Do you have commuter benefits or an HSA? How much money are you putting in pre tax? Discounted rates on commuter benefits? 

Figure out the difference between what you get now and what it would cost you to have comparable benefits and do the math. "
rapacityinblue,"Can you? Yes. Should you? No. 

Nannies are among a class of household workers who qualify as employees. You can market yourself as a self employed contractor, but you will be responsible for your social security and Medicare withholding and have to pay in quarterly. It’s a lot more work for a lot less reward, and you lose out on the protections you’d be getting as an employee. You also need a significantly higher income to offset the loss of the employer contribution. 

I’ve been a nanny for over 10 years now and seen every payment arrangement under the sun. You deserve real pay. Don’t settle for less, even in a nanny share. "

medes24,"My parents and I have our finances ""somewhat"" entangled.   My dad and I co-own some property.

Collectively we have a very mature attitude about our finances and when I ask them or they ask me to ""untangle"" for a bit we can do so amicably.   Neither of us is supporting each other.

I consider myself blessed.   In my time participating on this sub, I have read some pretty horrific stories of people being entangled with their parents financially.   If they cannot have a mature attitude about the fact that you must take care of your finances, they need to be cut off financially.   By all means offer to help them around the house, even go to the grocery store for them but don't give them money if they can't understand that it is YOUR money."
medes24,"You need to figure out what your objective is before you add more funs.   

Total Stock/Total International/Total Bond is the standard 3 fund portfolio.   It's boring but it will make you money.   There is little reason to go beyond this setup unless you are just looking to play around.

That said, I quite like SPHD - it is a high yield dividend ETF paired to the S&amp;P 500.   It pays monthly and the yield is quite good vs the price.   You can hurt yourself long term if you divert to much from growth into dividend payment but it is nice having that extra bit of income roll in each month.

I also get my jollies from playing with the interest I earn on my emergency fund.   I roll it into CDs and I've bought securities from the US Treasury with it.

For individual stocks, I mostly invest in stuff that has a good dividend: Verizon, Walmart, Johnson &amp; Johnson, stuff like that.   Companies that are making tons of money selling us staples and are sharing that wealth with their shareholders."
medes24,"$200,000 in a bond fund could be producing $400/mo dividends.   I'm not saying you should put ALL of the $200,000 in a bond fund as it sounds like she has some other liabilities you must tend to but there are ways to make the balance work for her.   It wouldn't be enough to live on by itself but perhaps when combined with retirement, TRS, and anything from dad she'd have some decent money to live on.   

Once debts are settled it will be well worth your time to look into lower risk investments that are generating revenue.   $200,000 is not an insubstantial sum and should generate useful levels of interest annually.    Again, not enough to live on but certainly helpful when combined with other potential sources of money she is receiving."
medes24,"You can open a Roth IRA.   This account has a rather low annual contribution limit ($6,000 for 2019), however it will allow you to withdraw earnings tax free at retirement.   At your income level and with your savings, you should be able to max this account annually.   

A 401k's annual maximum right now is $19,000.   You'd have to contribute ~$1583 monthly to cap your 401k.   You should certainly up your contributions there as even without an employee match, the 401k is still a tax sheltered account.   You probably don't need to try capping it though you have enough liquid assets that if you did divert that much of your paycheck for a couple years, you'd probably be fine.   

For that $120k in savings - if you're planning to purchase a home, sit on it.   $100k would be amazing as a downpayment.   20k might be a little light for an emergency fund (you should project 6 months of expenses) but since you have another 12k at your physical bank, you are probably fine.  

If you decide to forego the purchase of a home, I'd look to put some of that $120k into a taxable brokerage account.   You will have to pay taxes on money in this account but it's not the worst thing in the world, you'll still grow wealth faster there than leaving it parked in your Ally account.  

I strongly recommend you read [Investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index#wiki_investing) from our sidebar."
medes24,"Maybe...that sounds like a gimmick

What you want to know is your account's APY.   If it's not very good the bank may not list it but any bank that is offering good APY will advertise it clearly.   

The big banks like Bank of America, Chase, etc. have very low APY, something like 0.04%.   The online banks, like Ally, have much higher APY, in the realm of 2.2%.   This is why banks like Ally advertise that they have High Yield Savings.   Don't take a bank's word for it though, always research the APY.

Now let me give you some basic math examples so you can see what I'm talking about

Uncle Lester leaves ItsFressh with $5,000 in old Confederate bills.  After trading these bills in at an antiquities dealer, ItsFresh ends up with $50 and a pack of bubble gum.

ItsFressh takes the $50 and puts it in BofA at 0.04%.   To see the earned interest we multiple the balance ($50) by the interest rate (.04%).  If you remember calculating from math class percentages are already a decimal because 100% = 1 so 1% = .01.   

At 0.04% APY we have 50 * .0004 = .02.   So with BofA after an entire year of having your $50 on deposit you gain two cents.

Now let's look at 2.2% APY with Ally

50 * .0220 = $1.1

So after a year of leaving your $50 on deposit with ally, you earn an additional $1.10 in interest.   

The big banks will try to hide the fact that their APY is so meager that you will not see any substantial returns.   So be cautious of marketing slogans and just watch for actual values that you can do math on.   

That's how you'll graduate from using Acorns as well :)"
medes24,"I do this.   All expenses to my cash back card, pay cash back card off in full each month.   

It is a great strategy and many people here advocate it if you use a cash back card.   I actually moved from a Rewards card to a cash back card after getting this very advice on this sub.   

The downfall is that if you are not disciplined with your credit you can cause problems for yourself.   Make sure to enable alerts so you do not spend more than you have."
medes24,"I don’t see the point of #3.  If I need backup checking I have card and check access on my brokerage account.  I also have card access on a portion of my emergency fund that is stored in a money market.  And my cash back credit card (which pays into brokerage)

I am sure there are reasons to have multiple checking (when my grandma was alive my mom held a joint account with her in addition to her own) but just to do it for backup purposes or something? Nah.  Why do high yield checking when you can just keep it in high yield savings and transfer as needed?"
medes24,"Do you expect to need to draw on it? 

That is a nice windfall and you could do a lot worse than putting it in a taxable account with the firm handling your IRA.   Just buy the same funds you use in your IRA or invest in a target date fund.   

If you plan to draw on it, I'd look at some long term CDs or savings bonds.  Both of those will protect the principle while earning you some nice returns."
medes24,"Yikes that is kind of a garbage match.

medes24,"A mortgage is not the worst thing in the world and a reality for most people who would purchase a home.   It seems to me a pretty clear objective would be to have a house payment at or less than $1050/mo.   

Consider splitting your car payment 80/20 with the 20 going into a house fund.   If this will cause the repay to go to slowly, pick some other amount.    

IMO if you make it a goal to keep paying what you are paying (or pay less) for housing, then adding a mortgage even if the other debts are not resolved is not a serious issue.   

If you've not built an emergency fund however you should do so.   You don't want to go into the obligation of a mortgage on your home and nothing in the tank if something bad happens to one of you. 

In regards to the wedding: for me personally I would rather have a small wedding and a down payment for a house but the financial aspect is something you obviously need to cover with your SO so you have a real good idea as to what kind of drag on your finances the wedding will be.   "
medes24,"you're not being dumb for wanting fluid assets but it is pretty dumb to take early withdrawals from a 401k and have to pay the 10% penalty on top of other tax obligations you have on that account.    

If your freelance work isn't providing enough income that you can build a satisfactory emergency fund, you need another corporate job.   If you blow up your retirement trying to stretch things out, you'll just end up broke.   You shouldn't be broke with the skill set you have."
medes24,"I'm not really sold on REITs and would rather draw income from a dividend ETF or a bond fund.   I invest in SPHD to bolster my monthly income.   It's tagged to the S&amp;P 500 so it's about as safe as any S&amp;P Index fund I suppose.   

Bonds don't pay as well as REITs or dividend funds but are a nice hedge against a market downturn.   If people don't have money to make rent, REITs can struggle but OTOH bonds tend to be more sought after in a downturn so you'll end up getting more favorable terms as auction prices are driven lower.

Everything begins with a budget.   You must have a budget with your monthly income, bills, and remaining surplus + how that is allocated to food/gas, recreation, and savings.   

Once you have an idea of how much you need to pay all necessities for a month, you can calculate what you would need in a six month emergency fund.   That's your initial savings goal.   

For retirement: participate in your employer's retirement program (if any, this is like a 401k or other employer plan based on your type of employment).   If your employer offers a contribution match, make sure to take that match.

Open an IRA.   Roth is generally preferable, since it gives you tax advantages on earnings, but depending on your situation a traditional might be more appropriate.   The IRA is the place to buy your initial assortment of market-based assets.   We generally recommend the purchase of mutual funds, which are collections of stocks, over individual stocks.   

Once you have built emergency savings and maxed out your retirement accounts, then you can consider opening a taxable brokerage account for yet further investing.   Not everyone makes enough income to get this far - and that's ok! Using your IRA and employer plan alone can help you to build a good retirement fund."
medes24,"I am not sure you should be thinking about credit at a time like this.   You've got to begin tackling the debt.    Review any letters and documentation you have for account information, contact information, etc.   It is not uncommon for your student debt to be transferred to a debt management agency like Mohela.   

Until the risk of wage garnishing is gone and you are consistently paying on your debt each month, you will have this hanging over you so you should resolve it promptly.    Obviously you wont get the whole 50k paid back overnight but you can at least manage it.   

Once you are on a good budget that includes paying on your debt each month and have done this for a few months, then you can think about opening a line of credit.   

As to point #2 - yes a high yield savings account is invaluable.   You need to think about building an emergency fund and a HYSA is a good place to park an emergency fund."
medes24,"With a 401k you are generally limited to the funds provider by your employer.    An IRA is an account you control so you can choose what to invest in it.    The IRA simply allows for more control over your retirement investments with the drawback that the annual contribution limit is much lower.    

You can use both accounts though so if you have enough extra money you can max contributions in each account.   

We generally recommend contributing to your 401k up to the company max, then maxing your Roth IRA, then finishing up your 401k. 

Roth vs Traditional is how its taxed.   A Roth 401k is taxed similarly to a Roth IRA but they are both very different accounts."
medes24,"Lots of firms have privately organized funds for their 401ks.   My 401k's index fund is a Blackrock fund pegged to the Russell 1000 but it isn't actually a fund that can be invested in publicly.   Try to see what plan material your company or the company handling your 401k has published on the funds available to you.   Although I know with my company the fund data is....less than desirable. 

A 401k and Roth IRA are both tax sheltered accounts so in the ideal situation you would be able to contribute to both of them and max each one out, taking full advantage of their special tax status.   

An Admiral Share is basically a marketing gimmick but I will explain.   For many of their funds, Vanguard actually has two versions of the fund set up.   The ""Investor Share"" fund which can be bought into at $1 and the ""Admiral Share"" fund which can be bought into at $3000.   Vanguard automatically moves you from the Investor fund to the Admiral fund when you invest with them and hit the $3000 threshold.   The Admiral funds have lower expense ratio and in general are better overall.   

If I had to guess, your 401k funds are plan-specific funds.   Those ERs are pretty good.   The Investor/Admiral terminology is likely meaningless for these funds.   "

The general advice of this sub is to not buy things with debt that you can avoid so we would prefer to see you pay for a car outright.  Now, this is the most prudent financial decision but it does not mean you cannot survive if you take on a car loan.    You should familiarize yourself with APR, how it is calculated, and what the interest implications of a potential loan are.    

You should create a budget to determine how much is going in and out every month.   With your income, I would hazard a guess that a 12k euro car purchase is incredibly feasible and that if you set a savings goal, you will be easily able to chip in more than 3-4k euros.   

You should look into any tax-advantaged retirement accounts that might be available in your country but barring that a standard investment account is not a bad idea.   While we may see an economic downturn in a couple of years, if you purchase safe investments and are able to hold these through the downturn, you will most likely see an inevitable rise in wealth.   Though please note I am not a financial professional and just some guy on the internet! 

It is possible to invest in a Total US Stock Market fund so even if the economy in your home country is questionable, you could still add to your portfolio a healthy selection of equities from the United States.

AUTIGERS2121,"First off, you need stop caring about your ~~credit~~ debt score. You mentioned your debt score several times in the OP trying to justify your overspending.  No one becomes wealthy off of credit card points or airline miles.

Second, start listening to Dave Ramsey's youtube channel and actually read his book Total Money Makeover and follow his advice to a T, no cutting corners. You will never get out of debt if you do not change your financial behavior. I'm 27 years old and I can tell you're acting erratically. Debt consolidation is not the answer, it's a mind numbing loophole to trick yourself into believing you're helping yourself when in fact you're delaying the inevitable. The answer is stop spending money on unnecessary expenditures. Create a budget. Dave Ramsey says YOU tell the budget what you can spend and then the budget tells YOU how to act. Dave's baby steps are financial principles in which you can follow and fall back on when you get stressed. Believe in it and follow it.

&amp;#x200B;

Baby Step 1: In this first step, your goal is to [save $1,000 as fast as you can.](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/save-1000-in-one-month) (And not just “fast.” We’re talking *as fast as you can*!) Your emergency fund will cover those unexpected life events you can't plan for. Without an emergency fund, most people feel like they have to go into debt to cover surprise expenses like a busted pipe or medical bills. But not you! You’re not doing debt anymore.

Keep your emergency fund in a separate checking account so you won’t spend it accidentally (or on purpose) on things that aren’t actually emergencies. You don’t want to dig a deeper hole while you’re trying to work your way out of debt! So, how do you start the process of saving up for your emergency fund? Step one of step one is to make a budget.

Baby Step 2: Now it’s time to pay off all that nasty debt you’re ready to get rid of. Start by listing all of your debts you owe on outside of your mortgage. The cars. The student loans. The credit cards. The store cards. The gas cards. (Yikes, that’s a lot—but don’t stop now!) Put them in order by balance from smallest to largest. Don't worry about interest rates unless two debts have similar balances—then you’ll list the debt with a higher interest rate first. This is called [the debt snowball method,](https://www.daveramsey.com/blog/how-the-debt-snowball-method-works) and you’ll use it to knock out your debts one by one.

Now it’s time to attack the first balance on your list. Pay as much as you can each month while making the minimum payments on your other debts. We mean go after it! Sell everything you can. Get a second job. Sell so much the kids think they’re next! You want to get rid of that payment quickly. When you’ve paid it off, add those payments to the monthly payment on your *next* debt and start attacking it.

It’s hard work, but this is what winning looks like! The small wins you make at the beginning will keep you motivated to dump all your debt. And before you know it, you’re debt-free! Millions of people have used our proven program, *Financial Peace University,* to learn how to never worry about money again.

15 years mortgage = $1,899 monthly payment equalling $341,762 over the course of the loan.

Second, utilize the Dave Ramsey baby step method:

“If you have a high credit-based insurance score, an excellent driving history, and zero claims on your record, you'll typically qualify for lower rates. Of course, your score is only one of many factors used to calculate your premium.

Anyhow, onto student loans. I have minor student loan debt (compared to most people). I went to school on the GI Bill, but I still have around $20k in loans. I had issues finding work for almost a year, I moved across the country, and I had to go to school for an extra semester beyond what my GI Bill paid for. Anyhow, those loans are in default and it’s affected my credit score. I’ll be honest, I don’t even know what that means. What does it mean when a loan goes into default?

Now, I am a veteran and I am a first responder currently. I know there are student loan forgiveness programs for first responders and I was wondering if there are for veterans. I know that for first responders I have to pay diligently for a few years before it’s forgiven. Okay, cool. I guess what I’m asking is before I contact the powers that be regarding paying my student loans, what should I know so I’m not paying an unnecessary amount?"
michaelscottspenis,"Well, that’s not likely to happen this month, though I have made a hefty payment recently. I had a minor accident a few months ago and I’m currently awaiting some money from the insurance company of the person responsible. That would pay it off in full and leave me some left over. 

So if I understand you correctly, get it paid off in full and use it for small purchases, but just pay off the total balance before the due date?"
michaelscottspenis,"Then I have no money and life carries on like it always has, I just don’t have my grandma with me anymore. I’m just asking for a simple yes or no answer. If my grandma were to pass before I get my loans out of default, can the IRS seize my inheritance?"
michaelscottspenis,"The point is, I have more going on in my life than these student loans. Yes, a portion of that will go towards my loans. Some will go into savings (nest egg), some will pay bills. Honestly, it all depends what’s going on in my life when the inevitable happens. But if the insinuation is that I’ll be irresponsible with it (party, frivolous purchases, etc), that’s not what’s going to happen. "
michaelscottspenis,"(US) How to refinance my car and build credit So, I just checked my credit score, it's 592. Not great, but not terrible. Felt like that needed mentioning.

Anyhow, I need to refinance my car. I don't know at what percentage it is at, but when I find out, I'll edit the post with that information.

So the car is under my wife's name, but it's my car. I did not have enough established credit at the time, so we put it under her name. That was 4 years ago.

Anyhow, I can afford to make the payments I've been making ($333.16 per month), but I want to refinance it for obvious reasons.

Anyhow, I also need to build my credit. I pay my bills on time, but my credit is so-so.

Can I get the car registered in my name and use it to build my credit? Is my wife's credit score improving because of the payments I'm making on it? Is my credit score even good enough to refinance my car?

I have it financed with Capital One. 

Yes, I'm pretty ignorant to all of this. So please, bear with me."
michaelscottspenis,"Okay, I think I understand what your saying. Use it often, but I don’t necessarily have to spend a lot by the time the bill is due from that billing period. The point is to use it often and pay it off on time. "
michaelscottspenis,"So if I have an available credit line of $750, how much should I use before I start paying it off. I typically have about half of it used at any given time, but make my payments on time. And I use it pretty sparingly. Like once or twice a month for things like gas or groceries. "
michaelscottspenis,"This does. Thanks. I think what my goal is going to be is to just pay off the remaining balance which I can do in about a month to six weeks depending on how frugally I live and if any unforeseen expenditures occur. My registration is due end of next month, I figure that’s something I want to put on my CC once I start being smarter about how I use my CC. "
michaelscottspenis,"This is so totally opposite what my father has told me, which by the way has not been working. And he has great credit, so I don’t know wtf he’s talking about. 

But are you suggesting I spend my entire credit line each month and pay it back when it’s due? I make good money at my job, more than triple my credit line. And I make a point to put away a little bit each pay check. My incoming and savings is on point, it’s just my credit that sucks. 

Also, does it make a difference if I pay it on time, early, or late? I know paying it late sounds stupid, but my father honestly told me to pay it back a little late saying to just trust him. "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"The goal is to retire a little early at 63.
The basic breakdown is:

10% SPY, 10% IJR, 10% VEU, 10% DLS, 5% DIA, 5% QQQ, 5% VWO, 3% DGS, and 3% FM. It's split about 50/50 Domestic and International ex-US, with a sizeable allocation to emerging markets and small caps. 

The rest is sector funds I've intentionally overweighted."
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Stock accounts or tax accounts... What?

It depends on your goals. If you're investing just to have some extra cash, I guess it doesn't really matter how much you save or how quickly. But if you're saving for retirement, you need to be aggressive. You're young. You have time on your side. Compound interest will reward you and the longer you invest for and the faster you do it, the longer it will be able to work for you. 

If you want a buffer, just add more large caps. MGC is a mega-cap ETF from Vanguard.

I own 50% international stock. I own to diversify and I also own it because I know that sometimes the US economy will outperform. Sometimes the rest of the world will outperform. Developed markets outside the US are highly correlated with our stock market, but when you get into things like emerging and frontier markets, that's not the case. You want investments will low or inverse correlations to each other. That way when fund in your portfolio is really down, another or a few others will be up or at the very least flat. Make sense?

International stocks are best owned in a tax-advantaged account, meaning an IRA. Otherwise you run into weird things around tax time since you own companies in other countries and they tax things differently..."
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"If you contributed to a qualified retirement plan through your employer  in 2018 you are eligible for the credit. However, the camp most assuredly did not offer such a thing. Even if it had, you were never ""self-employed"". You worked for the company that ran the camp. I'd leave that part blank."
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"I can tell you're a boglehead! Nothing wrong with that. But I like to slice and dice. Perhaps a little too much, admittedly. I own DIA and QQQ because in my mind they make up a large part of the US economy. I own half as much of each of those as I do of SPY so that the S&amp;P 500 is still the predominant index being tracked and I'm overweight small caps because they tend to outperform. That's why I own IJR and DLS. I'm also placing bets on emerging markets and different sectors and subsectors. Like I said... I like to slice and dice. I'm being good and investing cash when I could be blowing it. I have fun keeping all my funds balanced throughout the years, so... Yes. I'm probably not investing the ""right"" or the ""best"" way. But I feel like I own a large enough amount of broad index funds to keep things relatively stable and smooth out some volatility while also investing in some riskier assets. "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Oh, I'm not arrogant enough to believe I've got the ""secret sauce"". I just invest in what I like and in what I can see being huge in the future. It might work out for me... And it might not. But I also feel like these sectors are obvious plays for anyone who is paying attention and who wants to concentrate a little more, like I do. "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Yeah... QQQ is NOT diversified. I'd open a Roth IRA and do 40% VOO, 40% VEU, 10% IJR, and 10% DLS. Throw in some VWO if you're young and like living life on the edge. There's a lot of good advice on the  boglehead.org forum as well. Check it out."
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"It's always good to be on the lookout for deals, no doubt. But if you're only investing when the market is down you're leaving a lot of money on the table. The best thing you can do I'd to continually, consistently add cash with every paycheck. Or at least every month. Trust me.

I took a look at ODVIX. I'd ditch it. You don't need to be paying 0.87% per year when you be paying like... 0.1% for VWO from Vanguard. IUSG looked good. I also own IJR so I approve of that :P Don't own VIG, but I'm not a big dividend guy. I owned VSS for a bit. It wasn't performing so I ditched it for another international small cap fund from WisdomTree, DLS. That pays good dividends. Finally, I would ditch VOT. Mid-caps are boring and aren't small enough to grow fast or large enough to add stability to your portfolio. 

You also own a ton of international stock! That's what's in VSS, IEFA, and ODVIX. IEFA is similar to Vanguard's VEU, which I own. "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Wow. An extra 3% annually would double my return at the end of my 36 year time horizon.

The sectors I'm in are tech (things like AI, robotics, cybersecurity, chips, IoT), healthcare/biotech (CRISPR, immuno-oncology, etc.), e-commerce, and natural resources/basic materials. "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"I agree. Meeting with a financial planner would probably cost you 25% of that. It's not worth it. I'd suggest you put $7,500-8,000 toward paying off any unsubsidized student loans (they're the ones charge interest while you're still in school). If you don't have unsubsidized loans, open a Roth IRA and put $3,000 in a total stock market ETF and $3,000 in an all world ex-US ETF. Vanguard is good. I recommend VTI and VXUS. Put $2,500 in a savings account for a rainy day and have fun with the $1,500 left over."
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"So you only lost $400? That's nothing. At one point I was down more than $2,000. And at the time that was about 16% of my portfolio. I held and kept buying. I'm a few hundred bucks away from breaking even. 

Don't try to time the market! Always put new money in. What's most important is not rate of return (although that is obviously a factor) but savings rate. Meaning... How much are you investing on a regular basis?

You said you're pretty aggressive. Do you international stocks outside the US? Small caps? Emerging markets?"
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"I'm self taught. They don't teach this in school and I decided I wanted to take control of my financial future. So... I learn all I can on the internet. I spent hours reading about trusts and Medicaid Estate Recovery the other day. Really fascinating stuff. I want to be a CFP, so I would love to talk with you more and answer any questions you have and help you learn. I'm not a pro by any means (yet) so I can't offer professional investment advice. But we can still talk."
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Contribution limits only apply to principal. You can invest up to $6,000 this year between a traditional and Roth IRA, if you have both. That doesn't mean $6,000 each, just to be clear! It means that the.maximum you could put in each is $3,000. Or just $6,000 in one.

Earnings and dividends grow tax free in a Roth as opposed, so I'd recommend that.over a traditional if you're in a low tax bracket/meet the income limitations."
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"$19K Invested - Is it Enough? Hi, everyone. I'm 26, turning 27 in May, and I have $13,700 between a Roth and Traditional IRA and a brokerage account with TD Ameritrade. I'm between jobs right now, but I'm rolling over $3,500 from my old 401(k) and Roth 401(k) and will be contributing my full tax refund as well ($1,807). That will put me right at $19,000 total portfolio value and once I get a new job I plan to start contributing as much as I can, which should be between $500 and $600 per month. Is this adequate for someone my age? "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Also, please don't think I'm being nasty. I totally get where you're coming from. I understand the idea that simplicity is best in investing, especially since it lowers costs. But I think my weighted ER is only something like 0.4% or something. Not especially low, but something I can definitely handle. I will always re-evaluate my strategy and will make changes as necessary. "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Have you put any more money in since this time last year? I highly recommend dollar cost averaging, even when the market is dropping. It lowers your cost basis and it causes your portfolio to shoot right back up off the bottom because there's so much more invested in it. You have to buy when the market is down. It feels wrong but that's how you make money. Investing is all psychology. Can you buy something and watch it go down 10% before moving up again? How about 20%? 30%? 50%? Can you buy something and hold it for five years? Ten? Twenty? Longer? 

Can I ask what ETFs you're invested in?"
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"VTI is definitely the fund to get if you're looking for exposure to the whole US economy. However, it holds all market caps. For someone who slices and dices like me and as someone who owns IJR, I don't want or need even more exposure to small caps than I already have. Although... I do own both VEU and VWO and there's a little bit of overlap there. "
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"Awesome! Thanks. I should definitely be on track for that, then. Although my goal is to have more! I want to retire with a higher standard of living, so I need to invest like I'm already there. I'm only making $25,000-30,000 per year before taxes but I want to retire with enough to have $75,000 per year after inflation. So I need to hustle!"
Just-A-Random-Guy-92,"OK, so... I've done the math. Assuming you don't have a qualified retirement plan you'll be contributing to and no health benefits, just straight income and tax, your effective tax rate should be about 10.1%. Assuming you work 30 hours per week every week your net income should be about $1,090 per month, or $545 per paycheck.

As for what to do with it... Open a Roth IRA and invest in a total stock market ETF. I recommend VTI. Invest 80%. Save 10%. Spend 10%."
f3vr3,"Keep making payments on time. Keep credit utilization low. Pay off your balance each month.   That’s it. It will improve. 

Do not seek out debt that you don’t need in an attempt to “improve your credit”. Just keep doing what you’re doing. 

Do you still have outstanding debts that are in collections?  Are you sure these missed payments didn’t get sent to collections?  If these debts are still outstanding, are you in a position to pay them off?"
f3vr3,"This is not a realistic planning tool for physicians. Most either do not know what specialty they will go into when they start med school, or they change their desired specialty when in school. There is way too much variability based on what field is chosen. Primary care docs might make $150k where subspecialty surgeons can easily be over $750k"
f3vr3,"How would he have that knowledge? Unless he went to business school, most education paths to make that salary early (tech, medical, etc.) contain very little financial education. It’s all self taught... and well... that’s what the op is here trying to do. Everyone starts somewhere. "
f3vr3,"First off, congratulations, you are crushing it so far. Can you increase your retirement savings further?  15% is great but if you have excess you can go as high as $19k/yr.  Have you made a ROTH IRA contribution for this year?

As for saving for the home downpayment, your HYSA is probably your best bet right now for modest returns and low risk. You could look into other low risk/relatively short term options as well (t-bills, cd, etc). You could also start a taxable investment account with vanguard and put it all in VTSAX, but that is more risky over the short term. "
f3vr3,"If it is not bringing you enough joy now to justify the payment, then think of how you will feel 5 years from now when that warranty runs out, you have a 6 year old car, and your payment is still the same $359.  I say return it and be done with it. 

You set a budget for yourself and in the heat of the moment they were able to convince you to far exceed that budget, but you have been given the opportunity to “go back in time” with that return policy. "
f3vr3,"If OP is really able to save $1200 a month, then the debate of high yield savings first vs Roth IRA  first is sort of irrelevant, at least after a few months. Let’s say he wants $5000 in emergency funds. He already has a little over $1000, so he should be able to get the rest in 3-4 months. 

By the end of the year he should have BOTH a cash nest-egg and a maxed out Roth IRA assuming no catastrophes. How he gets there in terms of which he does first matters very little. 
"
f3vr3,"Even taking into account your spouses resident salary, your rePAYE minimum would likely be lower then IBR. It’s worth investigating, the interest forgiven can be substantial. When I was a resident in a dual resident household, my payment on rePAYE was incredibly low and did not cover barely any of the interest, so therefore nearly half my interest was forgiven, taking my effective interest rate down to about 3% or so. "
f3vr3,"What repayment plan are you on?  With PAYE and rePAYE, if your minimum payment does not cover interest accrued, then 50% of the remaining interest is immediately forgiven by the government. If you can get your minimum payment really low then this can really reduce your effective interest rate and make it make more sense to put your extra $$$ elsewhere (house, retirement account, investment account, etc)"
f3vr3,"No way this actually works out unless she is heavily subsidized by your income. By the time you add in interest accrued, that $450k will be equal to the post tax income of a primary care doctor over 5 years. "
PeeB4uGoToBed,"Forgot that i was getting a 1099-R and i already filed Title says it all. I took out of my 401k a couple years ago to help with the down payment on my house and completely forgot about the fee I would have to pay through my taxes, I should just be able to go to their website and pay the fee from there when my return hits my bank account, right?"
PeeB4uGoToBed,"How do i apply for EBT/SNAP? So after my ex moved out of my house I've been somewhat struggling with finances, I make about $1,250 after taxes a month, it's just enough to cover mortgage and bills and to make things worse, the roommate that was supposed to be moving in soon said she won't be able to for a little bit longer. I can't seem to find the legit website for eligibility and other information, they all look like 3rd party sites.

I've resorted to only eating at work and they let me take some of the leftover bagels and loaves of bread before they throw them out for my nights off so I have something to eat."
PeeB4uGoToBed,"I'm trying to ammend my tax return but turbotax wont let me saying ""form 1040x will be ready 02/08/2019"". Its now the 11th... Title says it all.

I forgot to add my 1099-r and it said to wait until the 8th, this was on the 5th or so and it's now the 11th and it still says to wait until the 8th"

goldenlife14,"Legally, no, they don't ""have"" to be dual agents. They are legally required to disclose agency options to you, and provide you with the Minnesota Agency Relationships in Real Estate Transactions Disclosure, which defines dual agency, sellers broker, buyers broker, and facilitator relationships. Anyone who showed you a home without showing you that form (which is not a contract) was breaking the rules.

What it seems you want is for them to represent the Seller, and facilitate for you (work with you on the transaction but not represent you). This is totally legal, and done all the time for buyers without agents. It may be their company policy not to do this, but I'm not sure why they'd do that. Sounds like they've cost their Sellers a potential sale.

As far as not being represented... it's your call. Online home searches like Zillow are typically about 24 hours behind, and in a frenzied spring market, that can make a difference. That said, this spring market isn't nearly as crazy (yet) as last year's was. I personally believe the value of hiring an agent to represent you is more than the $400-500 you would pay them in terms of negotiating power, navigating the intricacies of inspections and title work, understanding purchase agreement paperwork, establishing whether a home is actually worth what the Seller wants for it, and so on."
goldenlife14,"Private tutoring is a great gig. I am not a teacher but I have a master's degree in math plus experience teaching in college and have tutored for 10 years. In my area (a fairly affluent suburb of Minnesota) I charge $50/hour for my current students, and $60/hour for new students starting after this school year. I do go to students' homes, and I only take on students close to me to minimize my driving time.

Most of my students do take a break in the summer from tutoring, but I'm sure there are plenty others who would tutor in the summer to catch up. Usually I stick with long term students but I've done a lot of ACT prep that is usually only for the few months leading up to the test. Could be a great way to just get some work in the summer, as the first two ACT's of the year are usually in September and October."
goldenlife14,"As for the legal question, I'm not sure. Would recommend posting to r/legaladvice or consulting with an attorney. As for the rest of it, and some additional numbers:

Yes, it would cause a hit on your credit, as the loan application would show up as a hard inquiry for 2 years.

No, it shouldn't be a hit on your end of year taxes, because you're only taxed on property sales if you profit from it. If you sell for what you purchased for, there's no profit to tax.

Are you keeping closing costs in mind? Depends on your area and loan program, but in my area, even if no real estate agents are involved, it still costs a Seller about 1% of the sale price in closing costs (just to pay for the paperwork to be processed and recorded), and a Buyer about 3% of the sale price in closing costs (paperwork processing and recording, plus all the costs to get the loan). So when you purchase from your mom, those would apply. When you sell back to her, if she's able to pay cash, it would be more like 1% to each of you since there's no loan. So just in closing costs, that's a $7,000 bill to your mom and $14,000 to you.

You also won't be able to turn around and sell it truly instantly, there's processing time. You'll be on the hook for mortgage interest for that time, though if it's for less than a month, it's not as significant of a hit than the closing costs.

As others are saying, it should be a lot simpler for your father to just sign over his stake in the home to your mother. If there's still any way to try to do that, I'd do it."
goldenlife14,"Technically, I would think you could, but it wouldn't be worth the taxes IMO (plus 10% penalty) just to consolidate funds. Plus then it would be counted towards your annual contributions, as it wouldn't be a rollover anymore.

I had a similar situation: my husband and I both had HSAs before we got married, and after we were married we started making all contributions to his. I kept mine, just stopped contributions, and whenever we need to pay medical expenses I use mine. Eventually mine will be depleted and then we will only have the one account."
goldenlife14,"I did this math with an Excel sheet when I did my recent refinance. Here's what my numbers were based on the loan options I had:

SCENARIO 1: 15-year mortgage at 3.525%. After 15 years, invest the full amount for another 15 years.

SCENARIO 2: 30-year mortgage at 4.3%. For the duration, invest the difference between the 15-year and 30-year monthly payments.

So, same monthly outflow for the full 30 years in both scenarios.

By my math, the ""break-even"" point was investment earnings of about 5.4% after taxes (assuming 15% capital gains tax, about 6.4% before tax). So mathematically, if I could get an investment return of at least 6.4%, Scenario 2 was better. If not, Scenario 1 was better.

I chose the 15-year, because the satisfaction and security of being mortgage-free by the time I'm in my early 40's is incredibly appealing to me, and worth more than the investment risk.

Edit: Worth noting, since you will have PMI, PMI will drop faster on a 15-year than a 30-year, so your numbers should skew a little more in favor of the 15-year than mine did."
goldenlife14,"As well as depending on the bank, it may also depend on the loan term. When I recently refinanced, my score was 750 but my husband's was 710. With our local bank, if we were getting a 20 or 30 year term, we could have saved 0.15% on the rate if my husband's score was over 740. However, for the 15 year term we did get, we were able to get the lowest rate. It's all risk management to the bank; shorter term is lower risk so the score threshold for the best rate was lower."
goldenlife14,"There is such a thing as a ""gift of equity"" that is what I believe you have been describing. Would require additional documentation and a lender that would allow it, but it can be done.

Once you are selling to a friend or family it's no longer an ""arms-length transation,"" so the rules for what the home is worth based on sale price go out the window. "
goldenlife14,"I dropped my escrow account through my mortgage and keep a separate high yield savings account for this purpose. I still make monthly payments as if I were doing escrow, but just as transfers into this savings account. I've got three good reasons for doing so:

1. Escrow accounts need to keep a buffer in them. If I manage this myself, I can put in there exactly what I need. If the mortgage servicer doesn't take enough they can start charging suddenly to make up the deficit, and if they take too much, it takes months to get refunded. I like having the control.
2. By keeping the funds in a high yield savings account, I gain interest. For mine it's about $50 a year which isn't a crazy amount, but why not take it?
3. I can pay my home insurance with a credit card, and get 2% cash back on it. Another $40 a year that I wouldn't have otherwise. Technically I could also pay my property taxes with a credit card, but my county has a 2.45% fee to do so so not worth it. YMMV.

So yes, there are financial benefits. They're small, but worth it to me. The main benefit for me is just having control over it, not worrying about escrow shortages, or waiting on refunds, and not needing to give them an extra buffer in the account (which is basically a free loan to them)."
goldenlife14,"From my understanding, investment account is better:

Say you get that extra $3,500 into your 401k as loan interest paid back to yourself. You do not get to deduct it on your taxes. Upon withdrawal, the entire thing is taxed at your regular income tax rate, both the original $3,500 and its earnings over the years. Plus, while you are in the process of paying back the 401k loan, you miss out on the investment growth during that time.

Or you put it in a regular investment account. When you cash it out, you pay only capital gains tax, and only on the earnings, not the original $3,500."
goldenlife14,"Assuming this is a conventional loan:

When you first get your mortgage, you pay PMI if your down payment is less than 20% of the purchase price. In your example of the Sellers being generous and selling for less than market value, it doesn't matter, because if they sell to you for $80k instead of $100k, the bank then sees the value as $80k.

When PMI is dropped as you make payments is a little weird, it's based on your amortization schedule. As soon as you are scheduled to have paid your loan down to, oddly, 78% of the original purchase price, not 80%, the PMI goes away. Federal law built in a little bit of buffer.

However, if you make extra payments, or if you believe the home has risen enough in value that you now owe less than 80% of what it is actually worth, you can ask the bank to do a new appraisal of the home (which usually costs $400-$500). If you do in fact owe less than 80% of the actual appraised value (over 20% equity position) you can get the PMI removed manually. How soon you are able to do this after purchase may depend on the bank.

For FHA loans, the rules are entirely different. As long as your down payment is at least 10% of the purchase price, you can get the mortgage insurance removed... after 11 years. You still have mortgage insurance if you put down 20%. And if you put down less than 10%, you're stuck with it until the loan is paid off."
goldenlife14,"Yes, the ratio is re-calculated every month of the loan. The amortization schedule you get at the beginning of a mortgage gives the numbers under the assumption you make no extra payments, but it will change if you do. However, it is only the ratio that changes; the total monthly payment is the same."
goldenlife14,"You can roll it over from one provider to the other and not worry about contribution limits, but you can't switch account holders, so there's no way to take HSA funds in your name and put them under your spouse's name. Same as for IRAs, they are individual accounts, not joint; you can spend the funds on each other but you can't merge them."
goldenlife14,"If whatever you are seeing a chiropractor for is not severe enough to see a doctor/PT instead, I'd consider chiropractor appointments to be a luxury. Therefore, if you can comfortably go twice a month, go twice a month. I wouldn't recommend straining yourself financially for this.

Personally, I used to see a chiropractor in high school, for mild back pain. I'd consider the one I saw to be as reputable as chiropractors come; commenters and OP, feel free to interpret that how you will. While I felt better after each appointment, I could only afford to go every three weeks or so, and I didn't feel like I was benefiting long-term, so I stopped going. I've since learned to manage my pain (which has persisted for 10+ years) with stretching and exercise. I don't regret giving it a try, but it wasn't for me. YMMV"
goldenlife14,"I think that, similar to employer 401k contributions, loan interest HAS to be traditional, not Roth. You can borrow from Roth but the interest paid back would be put in a traditional bucket. 

I'm not positive though, I just know that's what my husband's 401k rules are, and was pretty sure that was the standard."
goldenlife14,"It's not mandatory for all loans. Not sure the terms of yours. I am in the middle of a refinance right now, conventional 15-year term and 80% LTV, and I am able to not escrow. The bank is charging me a $150 ""escrow waiver"" fee as part of the closing costs (I believe that's a Fannie Mae thing) but that's worth it."
goldenlife14,"As others have said, yes capital gains will apply if you've only lived there a year. However, capital gains tax will only apply to actual profits, minus any expenses in acquiring the home and selling it and costs to improve the home. Take the sale price of the home minus your purchase price, but then you also get to subtract all of the closing costs you paid when you bought it, your closing costs when you sell it, realtor commissions on selling it, and any improvements you made while you owned it (note: actual improvements to the home, like upgrading countertops or putting in a pool, not maintenance items like getting a new water heater)."
goldenlife14,"Because if you just bought it for $80k, the appraiser will take that into account when establishing value. In real estate, market value is what a Seller is willing to sell for, a Buyer is willing to buy for, and a bank is willing to lend for. If all three of those were just established at $80k, a new appraisal isn't going to come in at $100k, unless you've made improvements to the property to justify an increase in value."
goldenlife14,"Both effects should happen simultaneously. When you toss in that extra $5,000 on top of your regular payment, you should specify that it goes towards the principal of the loan. For future payments, then, the interest is lower (since it is calculated on a lower total principal amount), so the portion of the payment that goes towards principal is higher. Since you pay off more principal with each payment, the loan is paid off faster."
carjiga,"If you're not on the lease just make sure you are covered from a legal standpoint. Some places if i recall correctly have laws in place that declare people staying with others over a certain amount of time a legal resident and you dont want to deal with anything im sure. 

These ""friends"" dont seem very considerate of you and i would suggest giving them the slip respectfully. Best to cut ties with them now since they are already moving to a different state from what you have said they wont be around to be your friend after their gone. I would leave for the new apartment and try to find a new job asap. I also would not give them another months rent since youll be needing it much more in the coming months. 

Good luck"
jaybird9428,I wanna do a Roth to have the growth be tax free and I’m not in a really high tax bracket at the moment however I was gunna ask would it make a difference if I paid the taxes using the funds I’ll be moving or pay the taxes with outside money?
jaybird9428,"Negotiating salary I messed up big time. So I had a job interview yesterday and they asked during the interview what my salary requirements are. I said X and they jotted it down. They had a range between X-Y. Anyways they offered me the job right then and there. I said yes but today I got the paper work and the offer letter which I have to sign. My question is, is it possible to negotiate with them one last time before I start and actually sign the offer agreement? They are in need of filling in this and one other position it’s a law firm. Any help would be great.  "
jaybird9428,"Need help with Roth IRA Hello everyone! 

I am about to start a new job that doesn’t offer a 401(k) or retirement plan. My current job I’m in a 401(k) through fidelity. I’m 25 and understand the importance of investing into a retirement account so I was thinking about rolling over my money to a Roth IRA however I don’t know if I should go with fidelity or with another institution? Any advice would be awesome! "
jaybird9428,"I thought that with a traditional once you pull the money out at retirement, the lump some is tax which would include the capital gains of the investment? So it wouldn’t matter how I paid for the tax when rolling over the money to an Ira? Also how could I calculate the tax amount?"
jaybird9428,"I agree maybe it’s best to not negotiate after I already verbally agreed. They have a three month probation period where I get paid hourly and then transition to salary. Do you suggest at that time, after showing that I can provide value and do the work efficiently that I negotiate with them ?"
jaybird9428,"Refund what to do with it? Hello everyone! 

I am getting about $900 in refund from taxes this year. I have about $16k worth of student loan debt and like $50 on my cc. What would you guys recommend I do, use it all on my debt or some or half? I feel like I want to use some of it for personal stuff but I do want to get this debt out of my life. 

Thank you! "
lolo0128,"There's a few free resume reviews online. But your best bet is to show it to your friends and let them see it and get feedback. You want to point out any goals you achieved, items that connect with whatever it is that you're applying for. One thing for sure, never give up when rejected. Make it clean and simple. 2 pages max."
lolo0128,"I mean, if you're exempt I belief you're salary? It's all based on what you're negotiating was when hired as far as what would happen on weekends. That's why it is sometimes better to join non exempt workforce, get paid for every minute of your time."
lolo0128,"I've done the same, but the minute I think about leaving my job, I have already processed many applications for my next interview. Rejections never bother me because I always ace the interview when it happens. Anyways, just make sure you're not going to be broke while you take a break. Think of your other half also."
lolo0128,"I did that few times, I think I hopped for about a year until I found what I needed. I felt sure of myself because of my experience and my good experience with interviews. I just kept putting more and more apps on jobs that fitted my skill and looked for most that would put me near my salary requirements. I always got offers, but I'll never do it again. On thing for sure is that I'll.mever be loyal to any company anymore, specially when they can take your job elsewhere at any time. I go in and work for what I want, I love my job, I make my own paycheck.

If you got networking friends, take advantage of that also. Good luck."
lolo0128,"Well, we have 3 kids, oldest is about to turn 11 so she'll need her own room. Maybe a 3 bedroom house might he good. Anyways, around here in Chicago and surrounding areas, you're looking at about 150k to 200k in decent areas. Anywhere else cheaper and you're giving up safety and I'm it giving that up, especially growing up in not the best neighborhoods around here. So yeah.

"
lolo0128,"Paying or not my debt to Fix credit I have been planning for a while to call my creditors and make a payment arrangement with a proposal to delete from credit, but if they don't agree I'll be out of luck. So what's the best way? I have like 6 old accounts about 1-5yrs old. My latest is a credit card that I had to overuse after my living situation changed and I had to care for my family. 

Secured Card $2k account closed ($200 limit)  (1yr old)- no payment made

Currently authorized user on my wife's credit $553($500 limit) (6 months old) $53 over. ( Minimum payment made $50)

I have some account that went into collection like a cellphone service, a past instant loan. A bunch of older accounts still sit there, and one account is being reporter by 2 debtors even after sending them to revise it.

I wonder if I just continue to pay off the top 2 accounts up there will my score be affected better since it went up and down quicker with those two based on usage and payment history.






"
lolo0128,"Yeah I look around specially since it varies a lot around here. I currently pay 1800 for rent, nice place to live in, enough room for the kids to grow, I dont feel poor every check and were able to save at the same time. I just been looking and thinking about a house because I want my kids to have their own backyard, able to do our own custom work on our house and such which obviously can't be done on a lease.

If I can pay 1800 comfortably, why can't i pay that for a house monthly payment?"
lolo0128,"Rent is going up 1.4% for lease renewal. Anyways, itll be 25 more dollar per month on top of what I pay already. I'll be sticking for it for 1 more year and I plan on fixing my credit.  I dont want to hope to much but trying is game. My credit is around 530s, passed delinquencies I think my total is about 18k maybe. 

The question here is, is 1.5 years enough to bump my credit to at least 640? My wife and I only have one credit card for 500 limit we pay it off every month. Is it doable? At the same time we will be saving as much as we can monthly to put it down whenever the time comes to buy a house. Maybe 2 years. 

We are living within our means. So any overtime pay will be for saving and some for personal leisure.

Thanks in advance.

Tldr. Is it possible to bump credit to 640 from 530 in 1.5 years?"
lolo0128,"Well I mean, after a year of buying and selling. I haven't lost one bit. I'm not going to put all my cash on it obviously. I'm just saying I bought $200 worth of it and got it back with almost another 100 on top."
lolo0128,"I'm confused now about getting a house one day So I make about 45k a year before taxes base pay. The reason I say base pay is because we get overtime about 80% of the time. I'm not going to say 100% of the time because it all depends on the day and how much work comes in. Anyways, last year I worked 10 months out of the year at starting pay and brought home about 65k. This year I got a raise in Feb and getting another in July, about 8% total for the year. 

I always thought about getting a nice house, but now I'm really researching that I'll probably only afford about 150k to 175k. I'm planning on saving for emergency and then making a savings account for a house down payment,  but without an idea of how much I can really afford, I lose interest.

I have no debts

Current utilities: 125
Fuel for truck: 140
Groceries: 300-400
Needs: 100
Cable/Home alarm/Internet: 145

Income: 4500 - 5000 per month "
lolo0128,"Becoming obsessed and Good feeling about saving About four years ago we were about to buy a house. Job left to MX and I had worked my way up to a good salary. I couldn't find a job that pay as well starting and lost all my savings, my new car and all the luxury we could afford. Credit went down hill.

Now, I'm back on my feet, been on my job for about a year blessed. Got 2 raises so far and have like 3 more. I quit buying coffee and giving all my money to the wife since she doesn't spend on anything unless we go to the store. For needs. Some casual spending here and there but nothing crazy.

I've become obsessed with saving this way, I plan on fixing my credit this year and hopefully by 2021 I can buy a house that we want and need. I'm just pushing this out there for people struggling that are making good money.

Cut out the bs spending and buy a coffee maker, learn how to cook good food, and try to read or play games when the urge to spend rises. 

I have my goals setup, I have read many books about life, money, and family. Habits. Habits are a big thing in success. Check out Atomic habits. It's a great book.

Anyways. I'll update this post once I reach more goals. This time I'm saving to be happy. Not buying to make the temporary feeling feel happy."
lolo0128,"Yep. I look at it like an adventure. They can replace you in hot second, you should be able to do the same. Look at the big picture. How much growth there really is, talk to employees that have been there a while, same with new peeps. I've done it all lol. From sweatshops to currently railroad."
lolo0128,"I dont mind the PMI. Saving that much would probably take me a while, but I can save 10k maybe less than a year. The thing is, last night I was playing with those calculators, they stated I could afford a 200k house which I know might be pushing it with taxes and house maintenance  and stuff. So right now, I'm feeling more better even just renting a house for what I pay rent for my current condo. I'm not in a rush to buy, but its always a good idea."
lolo0128,"Buying company stock for long term savings My company is a very good company. Is own by one of the smartest money guys. Anyways, I know we all take a risk, but it's been Secured for a while and I see only ups on the history, even a stable low return I don't mind. I was planning on putting like 5-7% every paycheck on it. It will be my long term savings since my company doesn't match on 401k. I'll be starting a 401k soon, but this stock got my interest. It would help me save for small things like, furniture, a future car, I have an emergency savings already. The 401k would also be used obviously for retirement but I'm guaranteed a good railroad pension also. Anyways,

Anyone else done this before? I have been putting money in there since I started and was able to buy them, so far I have gotten good returns on it. Nothing lost yet. And even if lost I'll keep it in there until it recovered."
lolo0128,"Planning to buy house summer/winter 2020 Any input is appreciated.

Currently savings for emergency fund of 3 months =$10k
Current salary = $90-100k /year
Expect to save some for a house down payment
$275-300k house

No debts currently
Family of 5

Currently pay $1800 in rent comfortably so a mortgage around there would not too bad, but with house maintenance savings plan and stuff I know it'll be a bit more. So I see that.

I just plan on saving and saving, I have changed my habits of pleasure spending and being broke. I eat more at home, cook good food, drink coffee and home and list all our expenses.

Have cash on hand for now needs ( grocery item, medicine, anything that is really needed) everything else is online away from me in my wife's account.

I plan on putting it all on a savings account with 2% interest. I don't want to haggle that money on stocks as during the time I will need it, the market might dip. So any interest is good.

I'm really excited for this, I'm pumped up, Everytime I give my money to my wife I feel good. Anytime I need to buy something we need and we are missing, I'm happy to have the funds to pay for it."
lolo0128,"I quit looking I quit looking at my money and only track what I have and what I can see. I gave access to my wife to keep an eye on my savings for any suspicious or wrong activity. Ever since I started doing this, I think less about money and I track everything, I budget for everything we need. I have an emergency fund and also a future house down payment fund.

Anyways, just thought I'd share this for you guys who are trying hard to save. If you can't see it, you can't spend it. Plus it's gaining 2.5% interest. Free money. Good luck!"

truedouche,What you find odd I find incredibly liberating. If I need marriage to make not as easy to separate then I really doubt I need marriage at all. I don't think having children is something I want anymore there is too many children out there in other countries that desperately need help. 
truedouche,All good questions if it came down to really wanting it I could pay the cash for it. I just emailed a realtor about looking at this vary house and I would have to have it inspected before putting in an offer.
truedouche,"Am I crazy for wanting a 40k house? Hello all! from reading this subreddit I found out I can afford a 120k house which is great! However, I have zero desire to own something like that at this point in my life. I have zero debt and about 15k for a downpayment as of right now. The location amazing but isn't terrible I've been doing house shopping for awhile now I come from a semi rich family (doctors) and they cringe at my selections. My girlfriend is also trying to get me to get a 100k house which I don't care for. Ill be charging her cheap rent. My plan was to have a close friend who is a contractor look through the house with me and see if any potential problems will arise. I am 30 years old soon to be 31. Thanks all. "
truedouche,Interesting well I am not in any debt at the moment. Do you think the 25% take home pay on a 15 year mortgage is stupid? I thought it was smart? I know a lot of people some friends have bought way too much house and I don't want that.
truedouche,"Buying a home below means? Am I being stupid? Hello,  I am going to be 31 years old soon. House prices aren't bad in my area luckily. I have been house shopping for awhile now.  At first my budget was around 80k which equates to around 25% of my take home after taxes on a 15 year mortgage. I can afford this and these are wonderful homes that have all the bells and whistles, more than I need really. I've also noticed a few  houses that are very low priced about 34k that needs a little work done 10k and it would be in great shape,  that I could buy and be happy with since I don't feel I need much. There are downsides of course like being outdated, not having much of a yard and the location etc. My issue is my girlfriend of several years will be living with me and she keeps emailing me houses that are 80-100k and I really don't think I want to live in a nice house like this, yet anyway. I want to be able to buy it with cash in the years to come.  I am very happy living in a small unappealing house that I can pay off in 2-3 years. (If I am being honest probably faster) My down payment would be around 50%. I have no debts and a down payment saved up. One of the problems I could see is it being hard to sell later on though and me being stuck paying property taxes on it for a couple years. What do you guys/gals think? 

&amp;#x200B;

Tdlr; I want to live in a 35k house pay it off in 2 years while I save for a nicer house to buy with cash. Bad idea?"
truedouche,"Thanks for your feedback. I am with you! I love, love, love not having a car payment but I am uneasy that the transmission might go out etc and I will be stuck with this or the fact that I might save more money down the line getting something reliable and cheaper that gets much better MPG. The fact is I've needed AWD 1 day in the year and a half I've had it its not worth the trade off of the money I am losing in gas."
truedouche,Hiya Justme\_au. Well the bad part is we currently have the Highest property taxes state wise. I come from listening to Dave Ramsey and his method is 25% of a 15yr mortgage so you don't become house poor like many people are and fall into debt. Plus 15 yr's lowers your interest rate which is nice.
truedouche,"Claypigeon99  thanks for your story I am glad things are working out for you and your wife. I am not aware of the prices in your area but I assume 57,500 is cheap? Were there any repairs that the home inspector missed that you had to invest into?"
truedouche,I think on 15 years it would be considerably more and that's over 25% of my income. It probably wouldn't be if I counted my GF contributing toward the mortgage since she's living here. I can't say for certain we will be together forever so I don't include her helping with the bills but the interest and payoff are what hurt me.
truedouche,"Yes, the location is not great but not terrible. I have been to the area and inspected the home from the outside and the yard sucks but the siding/roof looked fine I am not qualified to be a home inspector. The location could be better of course but it's not that bad."
truedouche,That's a great question I personally haven't got to look inside so I am not confident how much work needs to be done it looks decent from pictures but they can be highly misleading. Your second question is something I was planning to do. I don't see many rental properties in the area that are vacant so it should rent but probably not terribly high but If I could get value out of it down the road that's what I am looking for.
skiIlionaire,"Credit cards got us through medical school together while raising a daughter. No student loans for medical school. 

She works for state - so work gives 5% put into a pension that we cant touch. And she's been setting aside 5% into 403b and 5% into 457. 

"
skiIlionaire,"I get that - but just finished medical school &amp; residency and no student loan debt. 

Your last paragraph though - can you add on that. Thats basically the concept i tell my wife but I cant get it through to her. She believes the 15k she puts into savings outweighs paying off the credit card because taxed 15k is like 11k basically. "
skiIlionaire,"Putting into savings (saving on tax) vs paying off credit card debt My SO and I are debating again about this issue. I want to stop contributing into funds until our credit card debt is paid off (50k) she wants to keep putting into retirement regardless.

Her reasoning is - we will lose more by paying taxes vs the interest rate on credit card. Is this a true statement? Is there math to back up either side? She makes 240k annually. Credit card apr is 15%. Shes setting aside 7% of each paycheck. 

Ive just transferred 30k into a low interest balance transfer (2% first year 8%thereafter - no fees) 

Leaving us with $20k usd at 15% apr. Anyone go through a similar situation? And anyone with math skills to back up either side?

Thank you!"
skiIlionaire,"Debating with wife about taking out loan from 403b So my wife is the bread winner in fam. We currently have 50k in credit card debt. Ive just balance transferred 30k of that debt into a 2%apr 1st 12mo than 8% thereafter- no balance transfer fee. 

But the remaining 20k is through 2 cards (6k@18%)(14k@12%)

She has been setting aside 9% of income into retirement funds. I want to take out a 20k loan at 6.5% from her retirement and basically stop all contributions until debt is paid off. Than start putting back into retirement funds. 

We are mid 30s. Shes a physician that just started practicing last year. "
skiIlionaire,"Thank you for reply. She doesn't get matching but she get's automatic pension set at 5% her salary.  So she's putting some into a 403(b) and a 457 but also gets 1k a month into a 401(a) automatically. Your explanation is perfect though. She's theoretically saving money on taxes NOW but she WILL pay taxes for it when she withdraws the funds. Therefore paying off credit card debt is the smartest thing to do. Right? (And I know we'll eventually pay if off, but now - this was just a debate between me and her and I could not rationalize with her. Its why Im seeking help here) 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand 240k sounds a lot - but we JUST started making that money. To get to this point we were averaging 40k a year and medical school before that while raising 2 children.  But we aren't perfect. And that exactly the reason why I ask for help on here. We always try to learn to make better choices. I understand how credit card is ruining us financially and we're digging our way out now!

intuitiveG,"I have looked into it... it takes 10 years of qualifying payments to be forgiven.  I don’t see your point...

intuitiveG,"If your credit cards are maxed out anyway, do yourself a favor and cut them.  

Next ask to see if you can convert the PT to FT job and start living below your means.  Work on paying a little more towards a single credit card and make minimum payments on the other two until you can eliminate the balance.  Then rinse and repeat for the remaining two (not a fast process but very effective)."
intuitiveG,"In general anything high-risk, high-return is about a 50% probability of gains or losses.  That is the risk you take for those types of investments.  If you’re worried then low-risk investments are for you.

Sun_Bearzerker,"Should I send another tax return? I did my taxes on TurboTax and sent them in around mid-March. I haven't even heard anything back on if it's been received or not (I forgot to send it certified). Should I print out another one and send it via certified mail?

Sun_Bearzerker,"Yup. I hit a rut similar to OP's in my undergrad and one of my professors pulled me aside (she was also my advisor) and told me to come with her the next day to talk to the department chair. She went on to tell me that most departments have grant money to help students, allotted they meet certain criteria and have the minimum academic standing. 

The chair was glad to help out and told me a similar thing to ynotdoc0614's comment. They aren't supposed to give it out freely and even after I got it I was supposed to stay hush hush about it and just recommend to friends or classmates who were struggling that they go talk to the chair."

Sister and their husband are very secure in their jobs. Also, their mortgage payment is 1600 a month so it'd take me a hefty time to save that up for 6 months lol. 

By the end of October, my savings should be back up to 4k, and my credit cards paid off. While that's not as high as I'd like it, it's about all I can afford to stick in savings by then - assuming I want to give myself gas and occasional food money. Rent to sister and car payment to grandpa can be delayed in emergencies, but even then 4k is still enough to cover my fixed expenses (250 rent, 150 car, 120 phone, 150 insurance, 50 subscriptions, and 100 gas) of 820 for about nearly 5 months.

Sun_Bearzerker,"Any advice to better my budget? ## Any advice to better my budget?

📷

Hey  guys, looking to get some advice on if there is any way to better by  budget here. Attaching a PDF of my numbers sheet. Made a recent large  life change and move across country, so have some interesting  situations.

Explanations of where some things stand:

\-  Employed full time at 14.00 an hour in Alaska. It's not what I'd look  at as a permanent gig, but unless a job opens up in my field  (Occupational Safety/HSE) then I'll probably ride this out until I move.

\- Living with my sister as of right now. I pay $250/month towards utilities and groceries, no rent payment.

\-  Savings was exhausted during my move. I'm rebuilding it and want to hit  at least 3.5k prior to this winter. Intending to move up to city with  boyfriend - better empl0yement opportunities (as opposed to the small  town where I'm at now) and would close the gap there, which is a bonus.  If/when I move, we'd be living together - I would be paying part of the  expenses

\- Car was financed through BoA,  at $300 a month, but when I moved my grandfather paid it off and I now  finance through him at income driven payments and a low/non-existent  interest rate (I didn't ask him for this, but God am I grateful). I  currently owe him about 23k. As per my numbers sheet, I've spoken with  him and we're planning on income driven payments. He wants me to rebuild  my savings and pay off high interest credit cards, so I'm going to auto  deduct 150 from my account to his each month on the 15th.

\-  I have two credit cards. One through discover with a $500 limit, with a  $300 balance and a 24% interest rate (this will get paid off this  month). The other is Capital One and is a 21% interest rate with a $3000  limit and $2000 - I had to use it to pay for my car to be shipped :(  I'll pay this off with big payments over the next 3-4 months. I have my  phone bill auto pay set to Capital One, which I plan on paying off as  soon as the payment processes each month once the card is 0 balance, and  my insurance is auto payed from my discover account - same plan.

\-  Car insurance is 150/mo for full coverage. I still have a 6 year  warranty and gap coverage that I purchased through Ford as well. (23 y.o  male so this number still fucking amazes me lol)

\-  My only expenses after everything is paid is gas to/from work and  boyfriend's place and money to eat out if/when I eat out (usually only  with bf, and he generally pays, so not a common expense)

\-Currently  sitting at $500 in savings. The last page of the PDF shows how much of  leftover expenses each month I plan on adding to it.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried making a PDF, but it wouldn't let me upload a link - so I did a very poorly executed thing and made imgur links... please excuse the confusion on that, and thank you to those who take the time to help out.

I plan on trying to consolidate these under one loan once I get 6 months employment history and my credit back up. My savings account is through a local credit union that I plan on working with for this."

College isn't for me (at least not now) and my family, who is very intent on me staying in college, has threatened to kick me out once. I have no job or license but I live on campus. I don't know how I'll go about any of this. Any advice would help"
ALoneLucario,"I'll keep that in mind. The only remaining irl friends I have all live with their families and I don't know them well enough to live with them. 
 
As for work, pretty much anything that only requires an associate's and isn't too physically demanding (e.g. construction)"
ALoneLucario,I completely understand there not being a quick fix. I just wanted to know my options. Thank you for replying. Would it be worth it to finish school if I'm only collecting loans with no real direction? I know paths that I don't want and jobs that I don't want; I'm just not sure which careers I *do* want
SillyRecover,yah it has some mechanical issues that I don't want to get fixed but its probably still cheaper than getting a new car. I'm just going to save my money maybe look into investing or something. I'm young and dumb I want to be able to buy my dream car but maybe now isn't the time. 
SillyRecover,"Help with getting out of car loan? Hello, I'm a 22-year-old male looking to get a new car this year. Thing is I have a 2008 ford mustang with 130k miles on it with a current loan of $8k. When I first bought the car in 2017 it was my first auto loan so it was financed for 16 percent interest with a total loan of $10k with all fee's. Within the first year, I was able to refinance the car down to 8% interest. I now have a credit score of 730 and would like to get a new car.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelly blue book says the car is worth maybe $3k-4k. I make about $33-36k a year and right now have $6k saved up. I plan to buy a new car in the $17-25k range once I have at least $8k saved. I would like to buy the new car with as little negative equity as possible. I wouldn't mind moving over say maybe $1-2k from the previous loan. I now have my own financing and was told by my bank that my interest would be around 3-5% for a newer car.

&amp;#x200B;

Why question is what the best route to get what I want ?. Should I say pay $3k towards the loan and try to trade with $5k downpayment on new car ?."
SillyRecover,"okay, ill do that... the thing is I don't know what I'm really saving for...I don't know how to use my extra money. You can't take it with you when you die so I want to use it in a productive way. I don't want to be one of those people to just save money for no reason I need a drive."
SillyRecover,So basically you can't buy a better car until you make double the amount of the car you want to purchase ?. I understand the reasoning but life is short...could take a while to get there...I don't think a 25k car is expense but idk maybe ill just wait.
SillyRecover,"Lease to buy , buy , or lease ? Hello.

I want help on a certain financial situation. So say I have a 730 credit score and 6k of money to play with. I want a nice car but noting crazy. I don't want to keep the car longer then 3 years , I need to have about 20k miles of leeway a year , and I don't plan to really modify the car. I also don't want to spend over $27k and I am shopping for the car year of 2015-2020.

&amp;#x200B;

1. lease to buy - I could lease to buy at a low mileage rate making my payments lower. If I go over the mileage limit I wont care because I would just then finance the car. Thing is I would be financing a 3 year old car for more then its worth unless they reevaluate the vehicles price for what its worth at the end of the lease.

&amp;#x200B;

2. I could just finance a car new or used, but then I would run into the issue of not wanting the car in 4 years....But I wouldn't have to worry about mileage limit or condition.

&amp;#x200B;

3. I could also lease but then I would have to deal with a mileage limit and keeping the car in good condition.....But I would have free cleaning , oil changes , warranty , etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I know that the best financial option is to just buy I used car that's under 10k and pay in cash. I understand that but thats just not how I want to live my life. I'm in good enough of a financial situation where I can buy a nice car. I understand that this sub doesn't look at cars as luxuries but if we can please think outside of the box I would greatly appreciate it.

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone tell me which of these 3 options would work for me ?. Im asking this question for general information and knowledge.

## "
SillyRecover,if I lease to buy at the end of the lease do the change the cars value to what it would be at the end of the lease ?. I could buy a used car for 17k but by time I actually pay the car off it will be worthless unless you actually make extra payments to pay it off early. I don't look at mass produced cars to keep value so I don't see them as a source of income. I just want a nice car for as cheap as possible
SillyRecover,"okay yah that makes sense I know that a lot of people don't like leasing because you dont have nothing to sell at the end...but unless you have a car in the class of a Lamborghini , Ferrari , etc the car will rarely keep value.

I don't look at cars as a way to make income so I want a nice car for the cheapest route possible. "
Nahgloshi,"&gt;She will go on the title and gain ownership.

That would be the document giving her half your shit when you break up. 

To draw up a legal document you need to see a lawyer, not random internet people. I could be 12 for all you know. "
Nahgloshi,"If you want a kid, rent a 2 bedroom apartment while you buckle down and pay off the debt. My wife and I, making 150k combined paid out 80k off in 14 months. We moved out of our loft and into a 2b 1bath apartment for the same rent and are trying for a kid and saving for a 20% down payment on a house plus putting 15% twards retirement. Gotta sacrifice and grind it out. "
Nahgloshi,"43,900 in credit card debt? Is that what you mean by cards? If so, write a check to pay off the full amount and then cut up your credit cards and probably close your credit accounts because credit score be damned it's more dangerous to have the option to use credit for you both."
Nahgloshi,"Think you're financials display a red flag almost as startling as lending someone a credit card in your name. 

You make 54k and you'll only be paying 240 dollars a month on 100,000 in student loans. That would be the bare bones minimum and you'd incur MORE than that a month in interest. All this because you have the hope that you'll get federal forgiveness. This is a VERY bad plan that will guarantee you a life of poverty. 99% of people that applied for loan forgiveness were rejected. Also you're betting on being at this non-profit for 10 years which is just wishful thinking and very restricting. So 10 years down the line, when your application is rejected you'll owe 100,000 and THEN some.

As for the credit card, why did they not open their own card? Bad credit? Well now they've given you the gift of bad credit as well. Sofi won't lend to someone with a debt burden like you. Balance transfer cards up to 14k are also out of your reach.

Here's what you should do. Come to the realization you're in a bad financial state. You should be scared. It needs to hit you like a bolt of lightning. Action is required.

Step 1: Sell the car and buy a beater for cash. Put the remainder of the sale towards this credit card debt. Former car payment + 1k from you + 1K of parent goes towards CC. This will have you out of CC debt in about 6-8 months if you're disciplined.

Step 2: Find a job that pays more. You spent 100k on school, a return on investment should get you a job making at least 10-20k more than that in the private sector. You NEED a higher income to afford the payments you're required to make in the future. The debt burden you've taken on has limited your options, no more limited employment until debt is gone.

Step 3: When you're done with the CC pay off student debt aggressively. Don't wait for money interest to accumulate in deferment. 1500 a month minimum (on your current salary, more when you get a higher paying job) and whatever you can spare and maybe you'll be out of debt in 7-8 years and then be able to begin not being poor. I know this sounds harsh but you should start thinking this way if you don't want to be stressed out of your mind barely making ends meet for the rest of your life. You'll work until your 70 and have literally nothing to show for it at this pace.

Hope this helps."
Nahgloshi,"I'm conservative and anti-debt so keep that in mind. A general rule of thumb is you shouldn't own more than half your annual income in vehicles. That's 17ish thousand for you.

Don't buy brand new unless you're wealthy, otherwise it's like lighting a few thousand dollars on fire the instant you drive it off the lot. 

So buy a nice used car, year or two old for 17k or less cash with your savings. Financing is agreeing to pay more than the sticker price, over time, for a depreciating asset. 

Half this sub will agree with me, half with disagree. I'm just sharing one perspective. Hope this helps."
Nahgloshi,Pay off your student loans first. You can totally crush those student loans by the end of the year! Paying off student loans is a 100% guarantee return on investment. Debt free at 24... already putting towards retirement. You're in a fantastic spot. Once the debt is gone open up that IRA. I'm 31 and will finally be debt free in June. They destroyed my ability to build wealth over the past decade. Get rid of them ASAP and prosper. 
Nahgloshi,"Same dudes attempted it on me. The reason I knew it was pure bullshit after a bit was their thick Indian accents. One guy was like ""You need to talk to the special agent in charge, one moment. Then a guy that sounded straight Punjabi picked up the transfer and said ""This is special agent Robert Johnson, we're going to need to confirm your bank account numbers."" Hung up."
kingrobot3rd,"Fraudulent $500 charge “pending” in my account. Can’t formally dispute until it clears later today. Can I zero the account and let it draw into the $500 negative? TD Bank hasn’t been very helpful. Can I just empty the account? Let it draw negative? My concern is that this is similar to what I’ve read actual fraudsters do with P2P apps, such as Zelle (the unauthorized charge on my account is Zelle) which oddly enough I am the victim of. "
kingrobot3rd,"If you are willing to pay the entirety of the loan in the event of default, then your credit will be fine. If she defaults and you can’t pay the loan, your credit will be affected. How much is the loan? If it’s 10k, i think that’s manageable. If it’s more, you are exposing yourself.  The return on expensive bachelors degrees is proving to be bad value. What’s her major? Is she biochem with the work ethic and vision to go on to get a masters, PhD? Is she in the humanities? If so, the chances of her attaining sustainable income any time soon to support her payments is considerably diminished.  If I were you, I’d have her explore community college and reevaluate after a semester or two. Also, the value of the first two years or so of a 4 year bachelors liberal arts program is questionable at best. If you’re going to stick your neck out for her (which I would seriously consider for my kid sister) I would insist that she demonstrate her ability to succeed. Start low risk, see how it plays out, and go from there. Stating that you should NOT DO IT is a reductionist assessment that fails to acknowledge that we take risks for family and loved ones and that’s okay. Just do everything you can to mitigate your initial exposure and insist that your sister adhere to your terms if you are going to commit to more risk. "
kingrobot3rd,"Because I don’t intend to bank with TD after this fiasco.  And no one has even acknowledged provisional credits when I have brought it up. “Sorry we can’t do anything until the dispute has been reviewed and an assessment has been made after 10 days.” Not to mention many testimonials I’ve read say banks (including TD) do not consider P2P payments to be their liability. So I risk waiting 10 days to possibly be told “sorry your money is gone, you should be more careful in the future?” "
kingrobot3rd,"Did you read your contract with the creditor? It’s a giant pain but take a gander. The credit company may also be holding the funds until their liability is determined by their legal counsel. I work with creditors all day for a living and they take for-fucking-ever when your case is still at the call center. Low level phone jockeys don’t know anything and ultimately can’t do anything. Regarding what recourse is available, I’d say keep it cordial, ensure that everything is in writing but if you are forced into a call, if they record the call, so do you, get names and employee numbers, and continually insist that you will not pay for a service that was not rendered. Threatening to sue is no good as it’s an empty threat 99% of the time and they hear it all the time. “let me speak to your manager” rarely goes well. If you are going to take them to small claims, only let them know when you are locked and loaded and ready to go, saying you would rather just sort it out internally but you’ve read your rights and have a strong case. "
kingrobot3rd,"Haven’t been in the exact situation but my thought would be to wait for the offers. And be honest. Leverage doesn’t have to be secretive or antagonistic. I don’t know what the job is, but how you approach it can be indicative of how you’ll conduct yourself in your work. See it as an opportunity to exhibit your skill set in direct, clear communication and awareness. If you’ve already interviewed, take some time to evaluate how your interviewers communicated with you. What questions did they ask? What kind of responses did they give you? What might those two fact patterns tell you about company values and individuals conducting the interview?

kingrobot3rd,"Fraudulent Zelle charge on my TD Bank account for $500. Neither Zelle nor TD will assume any responsibility. What are my options? $500 charge is from Zelle with some dudes name attached. Transaction is pending, so TD says the best they they can do is wait til it clears on Tuesday. There is no activity on my Zelle account. Talked to someone on the phone from TD, told I have to call Zelle. Zelle takes 40 minutes (30 on hold with various managers and such) only told that because there is no transaction on my Zelle account they can’t do anything. I go to my local branch and they repeat the same lines, nothing they can do. When I insist on closing my account they say they can’t until all charges cleared. When I ask to cancel my card, they say they’ll chop it up, to which I say I can do that. The person who charged my account doesn’t have my card, if anything they have the number most likely. I ask for a statement from the bank that says they’ve cancelled the card. To which I’m told that can’t happen. 

What are my options here? This is infuriating and everyone just points to someone else. I’d rather not lose my cool on another clerk who can’t do anything. "
kingrobot3rd,"I’d be careful as a colleague just paid off all her credit cards at once, and her credit took a hit. Paying them down considerably might be safer. But open lines of credit, number of credit accounts, and credit availability all play a role in your score. If you pay and dissolve 2-3 active credit accounts at once, and you only have 1-2 active accounts, you may take a hit. From my understanding a credit score is not only for creditors to see if you’ll pay it back, but to see if they can make money off of you. Are you actively contributing the credit industry as a whole? Also something that just came to mind. If you pay down a debt early, the lender, while likely charging you for early pay down, is still not generating as much interest as the debt was scheduled to make. It says to other creditors that you’ll pay down a debt any chance you get and the interest they had planned to charge you over say 10 years is not reliable. "
kingrobot3rd,"Owing 300k to family is not the same as owing to a traditional lender. The repercussions of default are contingent on her grandparents taking action against her. Have they executed a contract with a personal guarantee?Are they the type to sue their grandkids? To report her to the credit bureaus? 

At a certain point, the size of the debt becomes intangible. At 300k, you’re going to be paying forever anyway. And I’m not necessarily opposed to the bet many younger people are taking in that a lot of student debt may be forgiven in the future. 

Making “poor” financial choices in your early 20’s in fairly common. I didn’t get my shit together financially until my early 30’s. I’m still paying college loans that directly subsidized my garbage coke habit in college. But I’m doing okay now. Manageable budget, no coke habit, and even putting money towards retirement. 

If the whole financial irresponsibility is a deal breaker for you, it’s something you two need to talk about honestly. Some differences between partners reveal themselves to inconsequential, others a non starter. I’ve learned over my few years of domestic life (getting married in August) that people are people, were all fucked up, and learning to accommodate or accept someone’s shortcomings is just in invitation for them to do the same. No one will have perfect stats. Say you end up dating a more responsible person in the future, maybe they’ll be a terrible fucking bore and you’ll only ever have sex on Saturday’s after date night with the lights off. 

It’s not your debt, you’re not married. Far I see it, tell her what you think, move on, and enjoy your 20’s.

kingrobot3rd,"First and foremost, consult any number of financial advisors until you find the right fit. Bring someone you trust to help you ask the tough questions. In the meantime, treat yourself to a fancy meal, some professional attire, and stash the rest in savings until you have acquired an adequate advisor. 

Be meticulous in choosing a financial advisor. It’s very easy for them to take advantage of people. Not saying they’ll empty your account and book it for Cabo. But you never know how a trained professional might find a way to rip you off. Don’t be afraid to drop them if it seems suspect. That being said, the right advisor will provide immeasurable value to someone in your situation. 

Look up horror stories of lottery winners in the states. A large sum of cash that drastically changes your financial situation is an invitation for trouble.  "
kingrobot3rd,"If you have Microsoft Excel, they have some great personal budget templates available online. Just google Excel Budget Template. 

I would start there. 

Figure out how much you need for essential living expenses every month. Metro Pass ($120ish a month last I checked) food, rent, school supplies, utilities, phone bill, etc. Be realistic. Include all fixed expenses and add a little cushion. From there you will know roughly how much you need monthly to simply survive. 

Extrapolate from that number. How much do you need, bare minimum, to live for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months? 

Open at least one checking account. I prefer two. And a savings account. 

I draft all essential essential living expenses from one checking account. Everything I can autodraft or prepay comes from that account. I do not purchase non-essential things from that account. Most of my paycheck goes in here. 


The second account is essentially pocket money. Give yourself a limit. Night out. Concert. New TV. Late night amazon purchases. It puts a reliable cap on how much I can foolishly spend on lifestyle nonsense. 

I use my savings as overdraft protection and... saving. I take a portion of my pay and have it directly deposited into my savings. It gains better interest and remains largely untouched outside of emergencies and preplanned larger expenses ie unexpected medical expenses, down payment on a vehicle or home and so on. 

Hope this helps. "
kingrobot3rd,"Keep in mind that a family member that can come out of pocket for 300k is likely very wealthy. If there isn’t already a contract with a personal guarantee, her grandparents aren’t exactly securing themselves. I question whether or not they really expect her to pay back in full. Keeping it “hidden” implies it’s like some lifelong skeleton in The closet. They’re college kids. She owes grandparents. Their concerns are not the same as being 36 with kids and shared expenses beyond rent and Netflix. "
kingrobot3rd,"If you’re gonna drop out of school with no support and need to pay mom’s back 5k, you’re gonna have to work more than 30 hours a week. With no job history you’re options for employment are limited to entry level, likely minimum wage jobs. And there’s a fair chance you’ll wear out your welcome at your buddy’s place sooner than you think if you’re not paying rent/utilities. Resentment, even among best friends, builds pretty quick. With no credit your housing options are also severely limited. I don’t know what the urgency is for dropping out, but you need a job or two ASAP. Don’t take on shitty credit products. Credit cards without sustainable income to sustain payments can fuck you up right quick. If you have housing now with the school, and not in immediate danger of being kicked out, just spend all your time job hunting. Best of luck.  "

For comparison I’m pretty strict on myself and we bought a home several years ago when the market hadn’t rebounded yet. Our mortgage is cheaper than an economy apartment was, even then. Compared to nowadays it’s probably 50% cheaper than rent would be. 

If I eat out I try to eat fast food for lunch or skip lunch (literally $4-7, budget is $8 or less). Then if I’m eating out for dinner it’s super cheap also, but i usually make something at home. 

I give myself $160 between checks for lunches, gas, entertainment. And I commute 50 miles a day so fuel is probably $50-75 biweekly. Of course sometimes I go over if I want to splurge. but I make it up the next paycheck. 

I’ve been living on $160 for about 5 years now. it sounded impossible at first. But now I find it fun to see how LITTLE i can spend between paychecks lol.

I would recommend that, if you REALLY want to be a landlord, don't settle for less than 3 units to start. That is, unless you find a 2-unit with at least 3-bedrooms a unit. The other advantage to 3 or more units is a lower vacancy rate when you have turn-over. I've been doing this by myself in all aspects for 10 years now, and there is always something to keep me busy.

If someone was to live off the severance for the next 2 years (along with part-time employment), what would be the best way to manage the retirement money?

I'm currently enrolled in school, using my GI Bill, and will graduate this May.  I'm concurrently enrolled in Grad School and expect to be finished late summer 2020.

Vehicle $28,951 @ 4.34% for 72 months

HVAC systems $12,810 @ 9.99% for another 9.5 years

I'm considering not continuing the schooling once the May graduation is done.  This will put my SLs into repayment come November.  The plan--whether I'm done this year or next--is to move in with a friend (she has a very large house with room for me and my two kitties AND her family lol) in the Midwest (I'm on the East coast) and sell the house.  That would get rid of the mortgage but no other debt.  While at her place, I'd be living rent-free but would pay her ~$500.

The new blended retirement is handy if you don't stay until 20 but it's not all that much, all considered.  If you do stay until 20, your retirement will be 50% of your base pay.  I retired as an E6 and that translated into $1637 AFTER taxes.  I had a mortgage, utilities, all the regular stuff but, thank goodness, no car payment.

To live, on your own, it costs about $2000 in a mid-COL area.  For every family member in your family, I'd add another $500 to that.  Start looking at saving for relocation expenses--the military pays for your last move but they don't pay for your rent when you're going.  Also, when you get out, now you have to pay for health insurance (Tricare Prime is $300/yr for a single); dental (varies but mine is $25/mo for single); and any medical appointments now have $30 copays (cheaper than almost any other insurance but they still add up).

Invest in the TSP and then transfer it to a Traditional IRA when you get out.

Oh, and this info isn't taught in the military at the present time.  Not consistently anyway.  Which reminds me: start building your network on LinkedIn.  You'll need it when you get out.  There are a number of folks who help plan for transition YEARS in advance.  Let them help you.

Thanks for the tip, I’ll look for another card for now and then one to pick up in 5 mo.

Out of curiosity, what is the reason for the 5 months? "
MPA_Dad,"If you have a 401k and not a pension, then vesting would refer to the time required to take the employer match with you should you leave the company. This is to keep people from jumping ship after just a couple of years. Leave before vesting, and you’ll only be entitled to the contributions you made to your 401k and the interest generated."
allynics492,"I just don’t know if we could get $13k I mean that would be a good deal for the car it is but I’m not sure. That’s a good option, thank you! What else could I add to the story? 

Edit-He currently has a truck that he can drive so at least he doesn’t have that worry which is why he just wants to get rid of it. "
allynics492,"Coming from another 24 y/o making half of that base, WHERE do you work?? As in, what line of business. I know this is your throwaway account. But my gosh, you go man, make that money! And also props to you for being so smart with it, investing and saving, I do as well but not nearly as much as you. It will definitely help us in the future! "
allynics492,"Without opening the whole can, it just seems we aren’t right for each other and there is someone better for both of us. It’s been a hard realization, but I’m ready to work on myself and spend some time alone for a while and begin a fresh start. I was very upset the day it happened, I’ll probably be more upset later, but right now I’m okay. We still have to live together for another month until our lease is up and we are both down sizing. It’s a little awkward right now lol. "
allynics492,"The truck he’s had since he was in his early 20s, it’s been paid off for a long time, we just use it for off-roading and winter weather. 

I really appreciate your feedback, I never even thought to just sell it. Any tips with that? Thank you!"
allynics492,"How to “give up” our new car? My boyfriend and I bought an used car back in July 2018 (I know, mistake). I am the primary on the loan even though the car is for him because I have way better credit (another mistake). 

We recently broke up after a 3 year relationship in which we thought we were going to get married, which is why I was fine with getting the car. Well now he cannot afford his lifestyle on his own, since we currently split all bills 50/50 (except the car payment and ins he pays for in full), he says he wants to get rid of it.

I don’t know what to do and I am terrified it is going to tank my credit which is currently at 760, and I’m so proud of myself for getting it up so high. His is 690. I have already talked to our bank and they said we could refinance the car, and I let him know of the option but he still does not want to do that because he can’t afford it. After looking at his budget, he may be able to if the car payment was much lower, currently $266. It was bought for 16k and still owe 13k. I’m not for sure the loan term if it’s 72 or 60, but probably 72 to get a cheaper rate.

Any ideas? Opinions? Suggestions? Anything is welcome. Thank you!!

Edit: Thank you to everyone that has recommended we sell it privately to pay off the loan. But, if we are unable to sell it, what is the next best option? Again, thank you! "
wild_b_cat,"Writing has never been an easy way to make a living. I'm not an expert in how content farming works these days but I suspect you're right.

I think you should seriously look at a change of vocation. Something that can use your skills but be a career. Marketing, advertising, technical documentation, copyediting, etc. Open the want ads and start looking and sending out resumes."
wild_b_cat,"The short answer to your question is that there is no short answer - it may depend on how the trust is structured and earns income. Is it buying pumps and selling actual product? Buying land and selling rights? Trading futures? The recent TCJA made some of these investments very complicated, tax-wise. Some of the income could even qualify as ""pass-through.""

However - as someone with some minimal exposure to an investment sorta like this, I will say: more than likely this sort of asset will involve more taxes than a regular stock/bond investment will."
wild_b_cat,"What and where are you trying to file? Do you need *physical* copies of your W-2? If you use TurboTax or something, then as long as you can put in the relevant numbers, you're set. And those numbers might be something you could copy from a transcript.

&amp;#x200B;"
wild_b_cat,"If you can afford it and still save money, it's not necessarily bad. But it's an *expensive* idea.

I wouldn't blame anyone for wanting to move out of their parents place in their 20s. But when you live in an area with very high rents, and you don't make a high salary for that area, it's usually wise to compensate by moving in with roommates instead of spending half your net on your own place."
wild_b_cat,"Frankly, you have enough money to sit down with a good financial planner and sort this out. There are just too many variables here for this to be boiled down to a simple question.

But, not knowing anything else, I don't see why you would be stressing about the down payment. You have a *massive* cash pile to draw on, more than enough to put a 20% down payment on any house in your target range without breaking a sweat. The more important question for you will be just figuring out how much house to buy in total, and whether you buy existing, buy new, or build your own.

(Though as a general rule I would never suggest starting homeownership by building your own.)"
wild_b_cat,"Once you stop working you can roll it over to a regular Roth IRA, and then (I believe) you can withdraw your contributions (if not your earnings). In the meantime, if you really have overfunded your retirement (which would be impressive in your 30s, considering the annual limits), you can just start putting that money in a post-tax account.

Or if you planned to buy a house to support your FI, you could take a 401(k) loan to do so."
wild_b_cat,"You should go back to the 2nd company and clarify that their estimate covers labor. e.g. that the service charge would have paid for the same size crew for the same amount of time. Perhaps they'll revise it upwards.

The air filters, though - you'd need to make a real clear explanation as to why those were needed."
wild_b_cat,"Older cars are more likely to have trouble, but no used car is immune. Even a 10k car could have major problems. That's why it would be wise to keep a cash cushion for any car you do buy.

Just buy something with a good reliability record and low repair costs (e.g. a Honda or Toyota) and get it inspected by a mechanic you trust before you buy it."
wild_b_cat,"Is a probate lawyer helping you with the process? If not, they would be a good resource to help navigate this stuff.

I mean no judgment if that's what you truly want, but there's a shit ton more in life that's also worth spending money on: travel, independence, education, etc. What do you want out of life?"
wild_b_cat,"If the first accident didn't make your rates go up, the 2nd one is very likely to. Whether it's worth it depends on your age and other factors that contribute to insurance rates; if you were male and under 30 I'd be very worried indeed.

Get the car assessed first. Make sure they look at the underside. And get two quotes: one to fix everything, and one to fix what absolutely needs it. Then make your decision from there."
wild_b_cat,"Correct. Over time your balance decreases, so you incur less interest, so more of each payment goes to paying down principal.

You can use an amortization calculator to see how this plays out. Since you're paying biweekly rather than monthly, you'll need one that specifically accounts for that, such as:

[https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/bi-weekly-mortgage-calculator.aspx](https://www.bankrate.com/calculators/mortgages/bi-weekly-mortgage-calculator.aspx)

However, I should note that your numbers look ... odd? I can't replicate them by plugging them into the calculator. It looks like your mortgage has an unusual structure."
wild_b_cat,"&gt;I looked on redfin and the tax record for 2017 said $5126. Is that the entire property tax for the year? If so it's less than $500 a month and I think I can swing that.

Yes. That amount will go up every year by a small percentage, so it could be higher by then, but if you got the house today you'd be paying about that per month.

For insurance. it depends on the size and nature of the house, and the local risk factors. $200 is pretty high unless we're talking about a McMansion."
wild_b_cat,"Every company is different, but if they haven't asked you what your expectations are, they're not looking to negotiate, at least not directly.

You should ask for a salary commensurate with your duties, performance, and potential. What that means isn't something we can say without knowing your situation."
wild_b_cat,"It's mostly a smart move. The only real risk is that you're swapping unsecured debt for secured debt. If you lost your job, hit a crisis, and had to sell your house, you could walk away with $120k cash and $25k in debt that you could seek to defer. Or you could walk away with $95k cash and zero debt. Swapping secured debt for unsecured carries that fundamental risk.

But student loans are hard to walk away from *anyway,* and you'd still have a cushion of house equity, so it's not the end of the world.

I'd pull the trigger."
wild_b_cat,"Just go with a joint account and only use it for specified expenses. You have no reason to keep more than a month’s worth at any time. Make an agreement now that if either of you want to terminate the account, you’ll split whatever is in their fairly.

If you’re seriously worried about losing a K or two and think that’s a possibility, then I’d wonder about your relationship."
wild_b_cat,"1. The estate is responsible for paying her debts. This applies only to assets that were only in her name. The administrator of her estate should pay those debts out of those assets. Any unpaid debt will remain unpaid.

But first you should send them the death certificate. Sometimes they’ll just forgive the debt. 

2. Depends on how committed the CC company is to collecting. Theoretically they could claw back any assets that were supposed to pay the debts. In practice this is unlikely.

3. Get a copy of her credit report. You may need a court to sign off on your father being the administrator of the estate.

4. Can’t hurt."
wild_b_cat,"/r/legaladvice would be better.

AFAIK landlords are responsible for solving the problem, but if the infestation were caused by the tenant's actions then the landlord can pass the bill along to them.

Did you contact your landlord before calling the service?"
wild_b_cat,"In many states (California, Florida, Washington) the 'franchise tax' is based on net corporate income.

In some states, yes, there are alternate bases for calculating a franchise tax. Like New York State, where you may pay based on your net assets ... but assets and 'worth' are separate things.

The closest thing to being taxed on 'worth' is valuing businesses for part of the estate tax."
wild_b_cat,"You don’t need a reasonable way to argue this. You want it, period. It’s fair to ask for it if you think you’ve earned it or will be worth it. 

Now, is that a good idea? I’d say no - they just gave you a fat raise, and asking for more even after they’ve said ‘no’ could make you look like an ungrateful whiner. Or it could make you look like a self-confident go-getter and impress them! It all depends on how valued you really are and what your relationship with your management is like. "
Rourk,"That’s true, but you can get a nice car for 6k. You spent more than what you had for no other reason than something nice. The car itself is fine but out of your budget. And with no credit, it’s definitely out of budget. 

"
Rourk,"I wouldn’t at this point. I also don’t have an Hr so I wouldn’t know what to expect from them. But he hasn’t done anything wrong yet(this time) and it’s just you worried. 

I also have a feeling there’s more to the story as well. "
Rourk,"3 months. Paid off most of my debt and working on last car before moving on to the next step. Shit has come up in my life and it’s been SOOO much less stressful being debt free. 

I make over 130k a year and every month had a balance of 50 left over after paying everything off. It’s a shitty way to live. 

I wanna be a millionaire not in debt. "
Rourk,"I get it. 

I just searched Honda civics for 6k and under. 

2008-84 k miles

2004 73k miles for 3600. Leaving money extra in savings for other emergencies. Car related or not. Age/mileage isn’t a great indicator anymore for vehicles. Consumers have kore to be aware about and more information available to them. 

I’m saying this not to be a dick, but to help you take emotional aspect out of it. Would have saved you some money and energy here. 

"
Rourk,"You’re your best investment. Do 2 years at a community school. That takes care of half. Working the entire time at a state school it’s possible to pay off at a good school. 

Look for employers who can take you in and help pay for school. Apply for hundreds if not s couple thousand scholarships. "
Rourk,"I meant gross income for salary for you. But 177/mo is cheap so good and smart thinking with that. Average car payment is 500+ now 

I know it’s easier in my shoes, not claiming bankruptcy before, but you should stop relying on a credit score so much. All it really means is you’ll give your money timely to creditors.  Debt free is the way to be. "
Rourk,"Nice and good job. I got fed up with debt and found Dave Ramsey. A lot of people like him, we not so much. But what he says is working for me. Has free podcasts to listen too as well"
Rourk,"Thanks:

Get rid of the pet insurance. It’s 99.9% of the time a ploy and they never really cover anything. Get rid of Spotify premium and use the free version. 

Pay off all your debt first. It isn’t much but your income is low and taking a chunk away from it. Youre going to need a second/better paying job to really start putting money away. Any stupid/unneeded spending cut. Like eating out. Brown bag everything and go beans and rice for awhile. "
Rourk,"Never trade in. Sell it on the street. Just saved myself 5k and everyone told me it would impossible to sell a 20k+ car on the street. 

Hell I’d buy your car in a heart beat. Toyotas are good cars "
Rourk,"Hey. Nows a good time to start learning about finances. Check out a Dave Ramsey podcast or two. They’re easy listening and can learn a lot. 

At 18 you’re at a unique point in life. I wouldn’t start off by getting a credit card. Maybe get your phone in your name or get prepaid credit cards. That’ll help build your credit. At 18 even with a card you’ll have shit credit. 

Don’t fall into debt just for a credit score. It makes no sense. Pay cash for things and if you can’t afford them either save up or realize you can’t afford it. 

You’ll save yourself a ton of money and headaches throughout the years "
Rourk,"You can still put money into a Roth and max it out for the year. 

If you’re self employed you can get a SEPP(self employed pension plan). 

Pay off all debts 100%. Start saving for a house to pay cash. Once you buy a house you put the money in mutual funds stocks and go for dividends. 

Make passive income.  Retire early "
Rourk,"This is what you do. 

Save the cash to get the car paid off on top of your savings. 

Pay off credit card debt. 
Attack car payment. 

That’s a lot of miles you put on. And for a finance that’s crazy. You’re at a huge risk of more mechanical issues on a low income with a car you don’t fully own. It’s asking for trouble. "
Rourk,"You shouldn’t need to feel like this at work. I think if I were you I wouldn’t care all that much. Do your job. Call him on his bs if you need to. And if you get fired or laid off for it, so be it. It’s better then keeping your job and being fearful all the time. "
uadmirin,"FA wants your convert my term life to whole life. I'm unsure if this is a a good idea? My wife and I each have a $1 million term life policy that is 3 years old. We have $1k per month for savings/investing. Our FA wants me to convert $400k of mine to whole life and put $500 a month towards the whole life. He suggests taking the other $500 and putting in savings for emergency fund. After we have an emergency fund built, he suggests taking the $500 into a non-qualified joint investment account? 

Don you guys have any thoughts? I'm having trouble finding info on converting term to whole.


Edit: incase this changes anything....he was the one who set us up with the term life in the first place. "
Deodorized,"If you act quick, you can open up a Roth IRA and contribute to the 2018 year, and then moving forward you can contribute to 2019.

Once you have your Roth IRA set up, you can set up a target-date retirement fund which will do everything for you, or you can invest in things like index funds.

There is a yearly limit on what you can contribute to an IRA, last year with 5500 and 2019 moving forward is 6000.

I would also look into if your employer offers a 401k, especially if they have a company match on that 401k. You definitely want to chill give at least a company match.

If you wait until after April 15th for the IRA, you will be unable to contribute for 2018.

Roth IRAs have a huge advantage over normal brokerage accounts in the fact that any gains you make in a Roth IRA are not taxed when you take them out. A regular brokerage account has a capital gains tax on the interest you make.

Some popular Ira providers are Vanguard and fidelity."
Deodorized,"This is entirely dependant on the interest rate of the loan.

If the interest is above 5%, I would say paying off the debt is a solid, safe plan.

However, if the interest rate is &lt;5%, sticking to scheduled payments and investing savings is generally the better plan.

In OP's case, his interest rates are 6-7%, he would be smart to pay off his student loans faster, as a guaranteed 7% roi on his money, give or take.

But the common ""pay off all debt no matter what beforw investing"" mantra has *got* to go the way of the dodo."
Deodorized,"If he was driving, I would agree with you. But riding a train?, no, that's a different story.

Deodorized,"Even still, they cover a large range of topics including mutual funds, index funds, individual stocks, how to save effectively, how to create and live on a budget, Etc.

Granted, not all of it would be useful to OP, but they still offer enough good information to get OP in the right mindset."
Deodorized,"I'm with this guy.

Max that HSA every year and never look back.

You contribute pre-tax dollars, you can invest and grow it, and then use it for medical expenses tax free prior to retirement, or if you never use it, you can roll it over to a Roth IRA and never pay taxes on it.

It is the only way to have tax free income from beginning to end. "
Deodorized,"I would definitely recommend the Listen Money Matters podcast.

They have a great range of topics, from beginner things like 401ks and IRAs, to the differences between llc's and S Corps.

If you are looking for somewhere to start, one of their best episodes in my opinion is the ""personal finance blueprint 2.0"" episode. It gives a really nice baseline of what your finance goals should be, and what you need to work towards.

I don't see them mentioned too much on Personal Finance subreddit, but they are definitely worth a listen.

Beyond that, I'm a fan of the BiggerPockets podcast, and radical personal finance."
Deodorized,"If you are wanting a set and forget sort of retirement fund, I would look into target-date funds that has a low expense ratio, anything .45% or lower is decent.

That said, 100% into vtsax at a  young age is not a bad idea. You can diversify a little bit by going into the international version, but personally I wouldn't go into bonds until 35ish deoending on risk tolerance."
Deodorized,"You can also roll over a Traditional 401k into a Traditional IRA, which can then be rolled over into a Roth IRA, essentially bypassing the Roth IRA contribution limits.

You still pay income tax on the funds doing that transfer, though."
Deodorized,"If you're wanting maximum efficiency, make the minimum payment on the 0% interest card, and then throw the rest of your leftover money at the card that has been charging interest.

That being said, with such low numbers it's not really going to be that much of a difference."
Deodorized,"The earlier you open and contribute to a Roth, the longer it has to compound interest tax-free before you have to withdraw it, which makes Roth more powerful the younger you are. However with traditinal 401ks, those gains will be taxed after it's grown for 40 years (assuming 20yo).

The general rule of thumb is that 401ks are more effective &lt;20 years, and Roth is more effective for durations of &gt;20 years.

~~What's worth more, 6k in a Roth IRA at 20, or 6k at 45?~~

Edit: Misread your comment, this is irrelevant.

I didnt know about TSP having Roth IRA options, though."
Deodorized,"This isn't something you get into overnight and quit your job the next day over.

While quitting your day job is definitely a possibility, it's going to take you a bit of time to get there.

Yes, there are people out there putting 3% down on rental properties, and being successful while doing it, but those people also have significant maintenance funds set aside for when something inevitably goes wrong.

I would recommend listening to the BiggerPockets and the BiggerPockets real estate podcasts if you are actually wanting to get into real estate and Rental investing."
Deodorized,"Then educate yourself on them. They are extremely valuable tools that open up many doors for you down the road, provided you are responsible and pay off the card balance every month.

Deodorized,"Max the 401K that your company provides, Max a Roth IRA. Both yearly. Depending on your age and risk tolerance, you could either do a target-date retirement fund, or some into bonds and most into index funds.

Get a 9 month emergency fund going and put it in a robo advisor like betterment with a ratio of 60% index funds and 40% index bonds, whenever that amount goes over what's needed for a 12 month emergency fund, take 3 months worth and put it 100% into index funds.

Once your emergency fund is at 9 months and your IRA is maxed, I would take 30% of the leftover money per month and put it into index funds in a brokerage account and I would take 10% and put it in a high-yield savings account as an opportunity fund.

People on this subreddit tend to be a lot more conservative than they need to be you might want to post this in r/financialindependance as well.

I'm a similar situation, but a little less income.

I would absolutely recommend listening to the Listen Money Matters podcast.

Picking individual stocks to hold is not a good idea, index funds are almost always going to get you a better yield, and they are much safer as well."
Deodorized,"Quick rule of thumb,

If you check your 401k or IRA balances amd they show 0 at any time in your life, don't panic at first. 

Go to your window and look outside. Are there dumpsters and buildings on fire? Are there riots? Is there looting? Is CNN showing city centers in ruin?

dadoo0,"Estimated Payments for 2019 Return? Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I have been filing my taxes with TurboTax for the past decade, and have never owed taxes any year.  This year, I got a $3,000 refund but I noticed on the TurboTax printout (the records PDF with cover sheet, e-filing instructions/etc) that there is a section called ""Estimated Payments to Make for Next Year's Return,"" which says that if I expect to owe more than $1,000 in 2019, I may incur an underpayment penalty if I don't make certain estimated tax payments (4 payments of $293).  I am a little surprised by this.  Does this mean that TurboTax estimates that I will underpay in 2019?  That seems strange given that I've never owed, and my wife and I (married filing jointly) both put 0 allowances and married but withhold at higher single rate under our W4s.  Why would the software all of a sudden think I may start owing?  If anything, this year I plan to bump up my 401k contributions (from 6% to 12%) and my wife has started contributing towards a 401k for the first time (maxing out), which should significantly drop our taxable income, no?  I'm a little worried because I've never run into this issue before.  Any advice?"
dadoo0,"Great, thanks!  If I end up changing numbers on W4 after running calculator to withhold additional amounts on paycheck, is this effectively the same thing as making estimated payments? Presumably, I'm covering my taxes to the feds either route I choose to go?"
dadoo0,"I see. I actually just ran a paycheck calculator and the Fed tax withholding numbers matched up perfectly when I tick off the Single/3 in the calculator.  I remember what happened now: the first year after purchasing our house, our accountant told us that since we'll now be itemizing, we should change my wife's W4 (higher earner at the time) from Single/0 to Single/3 so the Feds wouldn't get an interest-free loan on our money.  Since then, we've still had refunds each year but it significantly went down this year due to the cap on SALT.  However, another big change this year is that my wife is now maxing out the 401k contribution (\~$19k) and I'll be doubling my 401k contribution (from \~7k to 14k).  I would prefer if we're both at Single/0, but with our greater combined 401k contributions, is there a need to make changes to her W4 given the lower taxable income?"
dadoo0,"Ok, what is this cost typically called so I can speak intelligently?  I tried googling but I'm not sure.  Is this a ""trade commission,"" a ""sales load"" or something else?  What is a reasonable amount to pay for each time you purchase an investment?  Is it typically a fixed amount?  A percent of what you purchase?  

&amp;#x200B;

The way I see it, I could just open up a Vanguard account and purchase S&amp;P funds for cheap (expense ratio only?)  If so, what is the benefit to contributing towards an expensive 401k plan?  The only benefit I can see is that the money I contribute is tax deferred to lower my taxable income each year."
dadoo0,That's strange given that I make less than $100 in un-withheld income (via 1099-INT).  Is there something changing next year with the tax rates (going up?) that I should know about and maybe withhold additional amounts each paycheck (via a change in W4)?
dadoo0,"This is great, thank you so much for this info.  I always like to understand the mathematics of it all, so I have two follow-ups:

(1) where are getting the formula for the exact withholding numbers so I can run some of my own calculations;

(2) is there any difference or strategy with respect to which spouse claims the allowances. From what I recall, my accountant told my wife to do Single/3 on her W4 and me to do Single/0 since she was the higher earner(?), making it seem like this would give us the best situation but i cannot for the life of me figure out why or if he was mistaken."
dadoo0,"I just checked my wife's employer's online payroll, and I was actually wrong.  It turns out that her employer has this  listed:

&amp;#x200B;

Marital Status: Single (Fed); Single (State)

Dependencies: 3 (Fed); 3 (State)

Extra Withholding: $0.00 (Fed); $0.00 (State)

&amp;#x200B;

I've never seen the term ""dependencies"" as it relates to W4 info.  Is this simply what we must have put down as ""allowances"" under her last W4?"
dadoo0,"Ok, thanks.  My employer doesn't have a match for the 401k account.  However, there are two separate accounts where the employer puts money aside for me (for free).  The first is a profit share account (the amount changes every year) and the other is a safe-harbor 401 (equal to 3% of my salary).  Those two accounts are entirely funded by my employer.  This optional 401k account that is the subject of my post is a separate account that I can choose to contribute to."
dadoo0,"Great, thanks!  If I end up changing numbers on W4 after running calculator to withhold additional amounts on paycheck, is this effectively the same thing as making estimated payments? Presumably, I'm covering my taxes to the feds either route I choose to go?"
dadoo0,"Wells Fargo Advisors 401k question Hi all,

I work for a small employer who just started offering a 401k plan.  The money I defer each paycheck will be held by Wells Fargo.  I spoke with the financial advisor responsible for our account to talk about investment strategy, fees, etc.  I was told that Wells Fargo isn't charging anything to manage the account as this is more of a courtesy for our employer.  

&amp;#x200B;

When talking about how to invest my money, I was told he recommends going with S&amp;P 500 funds.  He said that he would wait for several payroll contributions (to let my account build up with $) before purchasing investments (and would wait again in between each new purchase) because it will cost a fixed amount of money (approx $70, if i remember correctly) each time I purchase shares, regardless of how many I'm buying, so that it makes sense to wait in between purchases?  

&amp;#x200B;

I am very new to investment/retirement accounts but this sounds odd to me.  Are you typically charged by your 401k plan for each time you buy more shares of an investment fund?  With my previous employer, I simply picked a target date fund and each payroll deduction, Charles Schwab (old plan) would buy X amount of shares of that target date fund with my entire biweekly payroll contribution, and I don't remember being charged for each purchase.  I want to call Wells Fargo back to find out more details about the fees, etc., to make sure I'm not being overcharged.  What should I be asking?  I thought you could typically buy ETFs or index funds with low expenses ratios (e.g., Vangurad) for free, making the overall cost of the investment just the expense ratio.  "
dadoo0,"Thanks!  Could you kindly comment on my last post above regarding my wife's W4?  I think we actually may have claimed 3 ""allowances"" on my wife's W4 several years ago (due to huge refunds) and simply forgot about it now that our incomes have risen."
dadoo0,"I understand that each ETF or mutual fund will have an expense ratio.  That is a fixed % based on the amount you ""own"" of that fund/ETF, right?  This doesnt go to Wells Fargo.  So Wells Fargo only makes money each time I buy more shares of the ETF/fund?  What is a reasonable amount for these transaction fees?  Fixed amount or percentage customary? "
_Raspootin_,"Clearing up my wife's credit first? So long story short..both of us had employment issues back in '15 and used our cards to cover bills, due to not having an emergency fund. I owe about $7500 and she only owes around $900. I am trying to build my credit and have been paying my as well as her's balances. I would like to eventually get a ""name brand"" card like an Amex or something where I could run my usual bills and such and pay off before the cutoff date to reap rewards and not pay interest. I was wondering if it would be better to clear my wife's name first and re-establish credit in her name, and then add my name to her cards (thus helping my credit too). Any advice?  "
_Raspootin_,"Comenity Bank won't put me in a hardship program. So I received another rude phone call today from another crappy subprime company. The Williams Sonoma CC issued by Comenity Bank. I called them back since I am 3 payments behind and asked about a settlement or a payment plan. They laughed at me and said they can't do ANYTHING to my account unless it was current. They spouted off they can't do anything ""due to a federal program designed by Obama"". I asked for a supervisor and was promptly hung up on. "

_Raspootin_,Buying GiftCards online..is it safe? So I hate credit cards and recently discovered Walmart gift cards work at Sam's club. I have a free membership there and have seen a few sites online where you can buy WM giftcards for around 2.75-3% off. Are these sites legit? I would rather save 3% on a GC instead of getting 3% back with a CC. 
_Raspootin_,"Anyone have any tips for unsecuring the Capital One Secured Card? I've had this card 3 years and they only upped my CL to $500 from my $250 deposit.

_Raspootin_,"Same here. I just spent $20 on a single pair of socks and my fiance thought I was insane. However they have a lifetime no questions asked warranty. They get holes in them?

_Raspootin_,"I think budgeting is entirely stupid. I have never understood the concept of budgeting, or it must be for people who have no concept of money.

&amp;#x200B;

You can either increase your income, or decrease your expenses. That is all there is too it.

&amp;#x200B;

Budgeting is too confining, and assumes humans are an equation with no variables. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say you ""budget"" $50 for clothes. So in 3 months, you actually put aside $150 not going into a IRA or other earning account. Let's say maybe you have a closet full of clothes, and spend $20. That's $130 you tied up for no reason.

Or you budget $200 for food. Do people eat the same kind and same amount of food? Of course not. 

You can get a job, a 2nd job, or a 3rd job, or go back to college and get a better job. That increases your income. You can quit eating out so much, pay on your credit cards so the interest doesn't kill you, buy clothes at a 2nd hand store, move into a cheaper apartment, etc. All that decreases your expenses. 

This whole categorizing your money thing is a moronic concept. Make more money and stop wasting money. All there is too it.

_Raspootin_,"Why I hate credit cards and here is why. So I'm probably going to get a lot of hate for this, but please hear me out. 

I've had credit cards on and off for 10 years. I'm working on becoming CC debt free. I still have my car loan and student loans, but I plan on having all my CC debt wiped out by the end of this year.

Everyone who I know who got a credit card has always uttered these 3 words to me: I'll be careful. 

Well not everyone is careful, and it should not come as a surprise that the US owes over 400 billion dollars on credit cards, which each household having close to $7,000 in CC debt. This is revolving debt too, so it excludes the ""pay in full"" crowd.

Even if you are overly careful, meticulous in fact, you can't prevent fate. People get sick, loved ones die, their car gets totaled, etc. As a result of some tragic accident, thousands of people wind up not being able to pay their credit card bill.

So no, end result is you can't be careful. You can listen to one of Dave Ramsey's shows and see this daily. I don't agree with DR on some stuff, but a lot of people on his show have been an eyeopener. 

With that out of the way, credit card companies charge interest, with the average being around 19%. For the privilege of lending you money, some pay cash rewards or airline miles. Some as little as one percent. 

My debit card costs me nothing. No annual fee. In fact it earns me 1% cash back (PayPal).

This is a great website. You look up a car you are thinking of getting and it will tell you what the most common problems are. Ex, engine problems, transmission, lighting, etc. It also gives cars a rating anywhere from ""avoid like the plague"" to ""amazingly reliable"""
Roarkyuubi1,If you want to you can but the bank won't cancel the card themselves. You have to call and get it closed. You can of course leave it open and your credit report won't suffer. You just might have to pay the yearly fee for non-use (look at the fine print to see if your specific card has this fee)

Roarkyuubi1,Usually more debt(or potential for debt) equals a higher credit score. It might go down a few points initially because they will do a hard pull on your credit score. But it will definitely shoot up once you use it a bit
piercena15,"Absolutely. I think you helped me settle this best. No matter what, I'll have the 1260 to cover the 630 i owe on the CC and the 630 I would put in the roth. but better to get rid of the debt considering the timeframe works out equally and there is no considerable benefit to investing that money now. Thank you :D "
piercena15,"Yea, I see what you're saying. I have been reading rich dad poor dad and i think my mind is in that place 'how do i get my money working for me NOW, rather than later'. Maybe that caused me to be a little short sighted on the fact that either way, that 630 would go in my roth by the 2018 cutoff date."
piercena15,"Right. I’m not discounting that used cars can be good. Just that I got this on a trade deal (dodge for a dodge) and reliability was my number 1 concern with the vehicle because I do the driving to ski on the weekends and I always have friends with me. In all reality, this car won’t take that long to pay off if I just stick to my budget and use my bonuses wisely throughout the year and my side hustle money goes to it as well. Was more so trying to decipher the flowchart and I appreciate all the help from everyone so far! I don’t want to dismiss options.. but having just bought the car I don’t see myself getting rid of it for at least 2-3 years. "
piercena15,"I could lose in the 6 weeks, but also, I can never invest that 630 again because of the 2018 cutoff date. So in the long run that could end up making me a small chunk of money over the course of my lifetime. I’m only 27 so even a 3% return for almost 40 years is not bad. I only have 500 in the Roth for the 2018 year right now. So even at 3% (super low rate to be safe) a year for 40 years, that ends making me 1100, but starting at $1130 and using the same interest rate I end up at roughly 3600. So that extra 600 could change an 1100 earning to 2500, if I’m doing my math right. Maybe I’m not though. Still new to this stuff. "
piercena15,"If I am budgeting and can afford to push it off a month, why not put the extra 630 in a Roth IRA? Especially when I haven't maxed it out for 2018 and I can't get that investment back after mid april? Seems like I'm just... giving away money. "
piercena15,"Pay down CC early or save? I have just under 700 on a CC card but only about 70 is due on this current statement. I have enough to pay off the card at the time the next payment is due but I""m wondering if I should move that extra 630 into savings/my roth IRA and just not touch it and then pay off the CC when it is due?

No penalty if I don't pay it, so thinking that investing is probably a better bang for buck. Thank you in advance if you offer any thoughts :)

piercena15,"Invest in company stock with a company subsidy, or just pull the money out and put in a Roth/Pay off bills Currently have:

  \- 500 in CC Debt

  \- 18k in car loan

  \- 2k in monthly expenses

  \- 92k gross income

&amp;#x200B;

My company offers a program that allows me to purchase shares with an investment shield contributed by the company. I can contribute up to 10% of my gross pay on each paycheck. My company will match 40% of whatever I contribute PLUS an extra 20 euro stipend per month. It is a EU company so everything will eventually get converted back to USD eventually, FWIW. The company contribution is subject to income tax and social contributions and will be taken out by payroll. The dividends, net of EU tax, are reinvested in (fractional) shares. They may be taxable, too. Lastly, there are blackout periods for legal reasons, but I can cash out my stock whenever I'd like to.

What I was considering was putting in my monthly contribution, getting the 40% match + 20 euros, and then when it becomes available (by the 9th of every month), immediately sell my shares. That way the stock price has changed very minimally hopefully, and I could take the match &amp; stipend and just pay taxes on those.. and obviously on the gains/losses. Essentially, I could contribute 766.67 per month and get roughly 329.17 in match &amp; contribution from my company, each month. I am already contributing to my 401k and getting the maximum of the employer match so I'm thinking this may be a better option to try to make some more money, and then each month when I cash out my shares, dump the money into my Roth IRA until it is maxed out. "
piercena15,Completely agree. The math is sound on that one. But the interest doesn’t occur until April 11th. I’m saving about 1600-2000 a month now anyways so making sure that I have 630 to pay it off isn’t really an issue in my eyes. 
piercena15,"You'd think for tech addicted millenial I wouldn't be so gun shy :P 

I went ahead and opened the account and put some money in. I'll just have to monitor it like I do everything else but it sounds like its very safe!"
piercena15,From what I’ve read the biggest reason to not would be if your time horizon is low. Or you’re 80 or 90 and your assets won’t go to a beneficiary if you pass and there are assets to pass along. If you can find something better with a higher return and benefits you tax wise then it’s worth it. I don’t know what those options are though. I’m not in your position yet but think I could be in 5-10 years anyways so I’ll keep following here to see what people say. Either way.. I think it’s just beneficial to invest it in the Roth and let it grow there since you can always take out what you put in tax free and move it somewhere else if you want. 
piercena15,"So my current statement has $70 on it. But my balance is at $700. So on march 11th, i would pay the 70 and the next statement would be generated for 630. No interest on that because that 630 is not on my current balance. 
"
piercena15,"No. its like 16%, but i don't pay any interest until.... april 11th IF i don't pay off the card then. So essentially, the 630 in the IRA becomes money that is working for me, where as paying off the CC early is just getting the card of my back mentally but it is costing me nothing in the shorter term. "
piercena15,"That debt isn't hurting you, but its debt. If I were you I'd assess the situation and do 1 of 2 things:

1) Pay off the debt. Get the monkey off your back and get back to focusing on growing your wealth. 

2) Take all the money you would use too pay off the debt and invest it in an index funds or something. Put your money to use. Then if you need some of that in august to pay it off, then you will most likely have it all anyways, plus some interest as well!

Either way, you want to grow your wealth through freedom from work and money. Thats the end goal here. Whatever gets you going in that direction and is easiest for you, do that. :)

piercena15,"Ally Online Savings Account, whats the deal? Is there no catch with this account? I understand I can only withdraw 6 times a month (which is 6 times more than I touch my saving per month anyways) but the only thing that I'm worried about is just the fact that its all online. I'm used to going into a bank and talking to someone and having them help me set up an account. Is there no real catch on this? I just ""open account"" through the website and then once its open I transfer my money in and thats it? For some reason, I feel like I should be skeptical of this because they have the highest APY and it seems so simple. Its just a savings through Ally? No credit inquiries or anything on their part? No hidden fees? Nothing?"
piercena15,"Interest is like 16%. Only thing is.. i won't have any trouble paying that off in April when it is actually due, so I won't incur any interest on the bill itself. Thats why I am thinking the Roth is a smarter financial move, because the money will work for me in my roth, but paying off the CC earlier than the money is due just gets the card mentally off my back.

With that said, I only have $1000 in my emergency fund at the moment and about 18k left to pay off in 71 months on a car ($310/month payment). Should I be saving say 15-20% per paycheck to add to the emergency fund and then whatever is left over I put towards the car payment? I can very easily make my monthly payments right now but I'm just not sure how much should go to paying off the loan and how much I should still be saving for myself. I get the feeling I should be doing both because the emergency fund won't even last me a month at this point. That said if I were to get in deep I'd have a credit limit of about 75k to lean on if stuff got really bad. I'd prefer not to obviously, but just putting that out there.

JohnniRobbi,"Little into a 401k if semi-early retirement is being planned for age 40? Hello,   


Currently 21 with salary of 57k. This will go up to 63k in May, and will end up being roughly 67-68 K a year after bonuses.   


Each year I will get a 1-3% raise. Call it what you want, but I am calling it a raise. I know it is to match/beat inflation, but most of you don't get this so I don't know why you wouldn't call it a raise.   


I have 22K Saved, and no debt.   


No expenses until this fall as I still live with my parents. Car is paid off, no student loans, etc.   


The only money that goes out is the money I spend on food and other items, video games etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been very active in financial markets for 4 years, and have achieved okay yearly returns 8-13%

  
I want to start working part time (for insurance) around the age of 40. I would like to have around 1M in savings by then or earlier, and live off of the interest mixed with the part time income.   


My ultimate question is, if this is my plan, doesn't it make sense to NOT max my 401K and other age restricted retirement accounts? I am currently only contributing enough to receive my company match highest % and no more. 

All of my spare money (22K) is in the market currently, and each paycheck I just add it in. I understand there are ups and downs but my math says 1k saved a month at 10% a year for 19 years is 1M.   


I understand I will have expenses that are recurring, rent, food, gas, etc.  and saving 1k a month is my MINIMUM. Wouldn't it make sense to put it in something I can retrieve at 40 and not be forced to wait till 59+?  


Thanks. "
JohnniRobbi,"Really? That’s bizarre. 

What ticks me off is at a company like this everyone is just another cog in the machine. Giving someone the 3% raise they earned based off of their merit two months prior to graduating on their new salary wouldn’t be a big deal to me. 


Appreciate the comments. "
JohnniRobbi,"I can and do expect 10% returns. Not being cocky or naive but it’s possible and I am doing it. So.. 

Someone having their money just sit sure. Somebody who has a background in statistics and markets in general can beat that 6% you are talking about relatively easy. 

"
JohnniRobbi,"I understand it has been a bull market etc. 

By active I meant looking at portfolio daily and making changes. 

I wouldn't call it investing even..

Regardless.... 


Appreciate the help. I need to read more on how to get money out of those accounts penalty free. 
"
JohnniRobbi,"Agreed, 

I do not see the point of a 401K if you are planning to retire early. Maxing that out to take a 10% fee of early withdrawal does not make sense for withdrawing 15 years early. 

If I have an investment account of 1M by age 40, begin siphoning interest as income, while working part time. Seems doable. And more logical. "
JohnniRobbi,"21 Y/O renting or buying? I am 21 Y/O and will be graduating in 2 weeks. I currently live with my parents and was planning to live with them till the end of the year to save money for a down payment.   


I currently have 28K in cash. and 1.7K in a 401K. Currently contributing 12% and getting a 4% match so 16% going into 401K total.   


I am salaried at $58,700, and after 401K contribution my take home is $1505 bi-weekly. I am expecting my salary to increase to somewhere around 62-62K in two weeks, and take home to increase to around 1600, keeping current 401K contribution the same.   


By the end of the year I have projected to have 53K ish saved by the end of the year cash. No debt.   


Homes I am looking at are in the 150K range. If I put 40K down on a home, mortgage/property tax/utilities should be around 1k - 1.1k a month on 15 year fixed. Is this affordable? I know it shouldn't be more than 20% of take home, but I live in MCOL area and expenses other then mortgage are not too great.   


Should I be looking at renting instead? Renting would be 600-800, and would roughly the same cost as a mortgage alone. When would be a good time to buy over rent?"
JohnniRobbi,"I agree with what you said. I do agree that time in the market beats trying to time the market. My personal opinion though is that it is foolish for someone in my scenario to invest into the longest bull run in history with my spare cash. I can afford to wait with that cash. 

As far as 401k etc. I couldn't care any less. 
"
JohnniRobbi,"I’m at a large F500 company. While it is large, it is lesser known because it’s not the name brand it’s what the name brand is made of. So no subs dedicated. 


Regardless of this raise or not, regardless of my history at the company, etc. I’d be starting at 63k. 

Don’t understand why asking for merit raise would be seen as unfair to be carried over by HR. 


I will ask a supervisor what they think, and dependent on that answer I’ll ask for it or not. "
JohnniRobbi,"I am not chasing money right now, if the time ever comes I can work 80 hours a week and double my income. I am happy working 40 hours right now and 4 days a week so I can do other things on Friday."
JohnniRobbi,"I appreciate the detailed response. 

Here is what I need clarification on: 
I understand you can withdraw your contribution tax and penalty free, but you could also do that via a taxable investment account? You may be paying more taxes per year but when you go to pay taxes on withdrawn gains from a 401K will it not add up to be the same amount of taxes?

I suppose I need to understand how taxes work on 401k better first. "
JohnniRobbi,"Funny you say, 

I play xbox because for me, the $ per entertainment value is unbeatable anywhere else, and it stops me from spending money elsewhere. 

Does looking to have a semi-retirement at 45 mean I have to sacrifice an occasional cruise or vacation every year or two? The answer to this will answer my overall question. "
JohnniRobbi,Well I mean it all depends on what retiring early means for you. I want to semi-retire at 40-45 and do part time police work to supplement income. I don’t want to fully retire till later. But I also want to stay the course and not let dumb financial decisions set me back either. I have also mentioned that I am trying to figure stuff out. I graduate college in 2 weeks and have never had a feeling of being able to do anything I want really before. Not held down etc. so asking questions and trying to figure it all out is what I am doing right now.
JohnniRobbi,"My ultimate goal is to start taking life easy around 40-45. I think I am set up for this right now, I just don't know how much I can spend on fun and still be able to achieve this goal. "
JohnniRobbi,"I feel like any money I spend will set me back in some way, which I think is the problem. The only goal I have is to buy a house, and spending 50 here or there will be 50 less I can put down."
NotYouTu,"Depends on your salary, and how much you put into that 401k (traditional) once you're able to do so.

The 74k limit is NOT your salary, it's Modified AGI (MAGI).  Many things adjust that number, one of them is traditional 401k contributions.  If you're able to put enough into your 401k that your MAGI goes below 74k, then you're good to go.

If your salary is well above the 74k limit, you should still be eligible for roth IRA contributions, so go for that."
NotYouTu,"Depends on a lot of factors, but one would be family.  If you're single, take it.  Have kids... probably want to stick with the more stable offer.

If you have enough in savings and investments to survive a lay off, high paying job might be the right choice.

If you have kids in school and taking the job means moving, stick with stable so you don't run the risk of screwing with thier schooling too much (if you were to get fired)."
NotYouTu,"I have a family of 3 and spend 500-600/mo for groceries... that's a MASSIVE bill.  I try to aim for about 30/wk per person, but I won't eat crap processed food so not always easy to get down that low."
NotYouTu,"Dues are dues, either they're a set amount (like 20/wk) or a percentage of pay.

As a new employee you should have gotten some sort of packet of information and paperwork to sign, benefits should be listed in there.  If you're unsure, just ask for your union rep or officer and have them explain it all to you... you are paying for him/her to do that."
NotYouTu,"&gt; I would make sure you are actually supposed to be a 1099 contractor as well, does the job meet the IRS guidelines for a contractor vs an employee or is the employer just trying to skirt the tax laws and screw you?

In my experience, it's always option B."
NotYouTu,"Yes, I do 65/20/15, CSI and maybe once a year rebalance if needed.

Lifecycle is an option if you want simpler, but they get too conservative too fast IMO, so I would pick one with a much later date than you actually plan to retire."
NotYouTu,"That car loan APR is too high, kill that as quickly as possible.

After that, increase that emergency fund a little bit more (assume you weren't living at home, how much would you need x6 is your goal), then taxable investments."
NotYouTu,"IRA is nearly always the better option.  You have more control, and fees are much lower.  If you don't have an IRA already, open one at Vanguard and then do a rollover to that new account.  Lots of good fund options, for simple use VTSAX.

The main exception to this is if your new job is with the federal government, TSP is their version of a 401k and in general has lower fees than any other option."
NotYouTu,"20k in a personal account needs to be moved to something interest bearing, either a high yield savings account or money market account.  Keep about 6 months worth of expenses in it.

Then max out your IRA, then max out your 401k.

At 12% you'll have to work for about 50 years (not counting any pension/ss/etc) before you have enough to safely retire on, at 15% that drops to 43 years.  Currently I save about 43% of my incomenearly all of that into retirement accounts (max both tsp/401k and ira each year for me, wife just started part-time work so we haven't started her accounts yet).

Everything you can put into tax advantaged accounts (401k/ira/etc) the better.  Only look at taxable accounts if you have a specific reason (such as maxing out those accounts, or saving for a specific goal like a house).

Cut out those individual stocks, unless you really like gambling.  Index funds, if you want to focus on divided bearing there are funds specifically for that."
NotYouTu,"Yeah, if you have TSP max that before IRA, C, S, and maybe I is all you need.

Check out vanguard funds, fees there are generally cheaper.

You want to take advantage of the tax benefits, there are ways to get the money out later without penalties so you shouldn't worry too much about that."
NotYouTu,"Sounds like a shitty plan, ever one I've had allows it.

Either way, your giving up possible gains on the off chance that sometime in the future you are making enough money that you need to backdoor a roth, your 401k plan at that point in time does not allow rollovers from IRAs, AND that you're maxing out your 401k already."
NotYouTu,"VTSAX is the total stock market, that's probably what you want.  You can do 100% that and be just fine.

Some like to add in international exposure (more than VTSAX already has due to the multi-national nature of most US companies) and VTIAX covers that.

If you want bonds go for it, but don't go more than 10%.  Most studies show 100% stock or 90/10 stock/bonds performs about the same in the long run, in some cases 90/10 can even win out (slightly).

Since you only have 5500 in there (you said you maxed out 2018) I would suggest just staying in VTSAX for right now.  Most of their funds have a 3k minimum, so if you want to have said 20% of your
funds in international then once you have 15k in your account you can move 3k over to VTIAX and have an 80/20 split.  You could use ETFs to get the split earlier, but I prefer simple.



Only time you want to increase bonds is in the few years before retirement, and then you draw then down over the first decade  of retirement.  It's called a bond tent and is used to reduce the risk in the first decade (which is when the risk of failure due to market collapse is the highest)."
NotYouTu,"Welcome to adulting.  You're going to pay that 15% taxes with or without the union.  The union has gotten you more than minimum wage for your area, take it as a win.

Since you said part time, I'll assume 20 hours (also makes math easier).  At 20 hours/wk the union is taking 1/hr from you, leaving you with 11/hr.  That's about 25% higher than minimum wage for your area.  If I could give a group 1/hr out of my pay to get a 25% increase in salary I'd do that in a heartbeat."
NotYouTu,"&gt; All this starts to make me panic, and yada yada yada long story short I was conned into paying money at the local grocery store for google play gift cards as payment.

Long story needs details... how in the hell did he convince you that the correct procedure to pay a court fine was with google play gift cards?"
NotYouTu,"As many others have said, I doubt serpate accounts is going to fix things for you.  That said, I'll explain how we do things.

My wife is a spender, I prefer to plan and only buy what I really need or want (I went 3 years before I made a major purchase I wanted, and so far regret the purchase as I don't think I've touched it since the day I got it).

My wife's pay (1/4 of what I make) goes into a joint account, as soon as that happens I transfer it to an account she doesn't have access to.  I took over the finances 1-2 years into the relationship (we've now been married over 10) when I realized how terrible she is with money.

I budget EVERYTHING, all of it, our budget has over 20 line items (we also have a kid, so things like music tutor is it's own line item).

Each of us has a monthly, rolling, personal fund.  Hers is 3x as big as mine.  We also both have a lunch budget (again, her's bigger than mine) that we can use flexibly (work snacks, taking a friend out to lunch, etc).  Most of the time we don't use up our whole lunch budgets as we bring in food, but it's there (and does not roll over month to month).

So, what is a personal expense?  Oh, we've had a few fights over it, but simply put anything that is for one person and isn't a need.  New clothes for work, that's shared shopping budget.  New clothes because this shirt was so pretty and on sale, that's a personal purchase.  Beer (my wife doesn't drink) well... that's most of my personal budget (and my books/video games, that's pretty much my whole entertainment package right there).

Anything work related is shared budget, for me (IT) that means certification stuff and my wife works in fitness so she also has monthly/yearly certifications to maintain.  My wife is starting to work on finishing her BA (finally), so that is also shared budget.

Gifts come from a shared budget that rolls over (we're currently over on that one, stupid family getting married).

If one of us stops working (most likely my wife) then their personal budget will drop (but they will still have some personal spending).

It's not perfect, my wife is almost always over budget but compared to what we did before it's a major improvement.  We went from nearly pay check to paycheck to having a savings rate of 43.6% in a year (and I took a signifigant pay cut in that time, which was how I was able to get a tighter budget put in place)."
NotYouTu,"I'll exapnd for you, they are completely wrong.  You should max 401k, IRA and HSA (if you have one) before going taxable 95% of the time.

As others have told you, there are ways to access that money earlier without penalty, there is almost no reason to give up on the tax advantages.

Some exceptions are if you're saving for a specific long term goal, such as a house.  Even then, depending on how far off that is might still keep going 401k/ira."
NotYouTu,"You'd pay taxes now at your current rate (and it would be on top of your current salary).  Better to do that later when you aren't working any more.

Also, the math says at the end of the day there isn't a major difference between traditional and roth if your tax rate today is the same as when you retire.  Some of the FIRE blogs explain it better than I could."
NotYouTu,"&gt; Yes. Pay them off. Start with the car loans as those are depreciating assets.

That's backwards, car loans have extremely low interest rates and should be paid off last (or even not accelerated at all and paid off on time, so more can be sent to investments).

Only reason to pay off a car loan first is if it's not a car loan but really a signature loan used to buy a car."
NotYouTu,"I've been using mealime for about a month, averaging 90/wk for a family of 3 with some leftovers for lunches.  Most meals have been ok, a few really good and only one we didn't really like at all (still edible, just not really enjoyable).

One note, some of them have a TON of veggies, we've had a little bit of waste because of it."
NotYouTu,"Check the fine print, often they say something along the lines of ""average balance of..."" which means if you ever actually need that emergency money you lose the interest rate until you refill it.

Only keep 3-6 months worth of bills in cash, put the rest in an index fund."
NotYouTu,"&gt; my father told us never to spend more than we had, but my mother never was good with money. 

Sounds like my wife and I.  She doesn't understand all those little impulse purchases add up, always the same thing ""It's not like I'm buying gucci or prada, it's just X"".  She actually complains that looking at a budget and tracking spending causes her too much stress... All she has to do is give me the reciepts and once a week I go over with her how much we've spent in what categories."

01123581321AhFuckIt,"[US] Help me understand how much I would be taxed in this scenario... # ALL MY QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ANSWERED AND I HAVE LEARNED NEW THINGS. THANKS FOR THE EDUCATION.

*I have left my post intact below for posterity's sake.*  

***

So I will be working on an hourly wage of 20 dollars. I usually work anywhere between 10-20 hrs overtime per week at 1.5 times my normal hourly wage all hours after 40 hours. I haven't been employed since before I filed my 2018 taxes. I'll start this new job in May.

From my understanding, for the 2019 tax year, I will be taxed 12% federally if I earn $39,475 or less this year. With overtime, over a 1 year period, I will most definitely exceed that, but given that I started in the middle of the year, I won't get past $39,475 by tax season so I will remain in the 12% bracket for the 2019 tax year rather than being bumped up to the 22% tax bracket. Is my line of reasoning correct?

Given that I live with my mother and she's the head of household and I'm filing as single, would it behoove me to move out in 2020 to my own place and become head of household to extend the 12% tax bracket to a maximum of $52,850 (assuming I cap my overtime to make sure I don't exceed that)? If so, does it matter when I become head of household in 2020 for tax purposes? Suppose for the 2020 tax year, I still lived with my mother up until the month before tax season in 2021 for the 2020 tax year, would I be able to file as head of household still or would have to file as single since I spent most of the year living with my mother?

[Here's the source I used for tax brackets for 2019 tax year.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/taxes/federal-income-tax-brackets/)

Clarification questions are welcome if it means you getting to give me a more accurate answer."
01123581321AhFuckIt,"Would there be a problem if I contributed to my father's Roth IRA directly? Long story short: My father is a naturalized US citizen with a low-income job (less than 30K a year) and doesn't have a retirement account at the age of 48. I want to open a Roth IRA for him and contribute the maximum 6K a year for him. I have a high-income job and can afford to do this. We live in NYC if that helps. 

My only concern is if contributing money into a Roth IRA with money not from your own personal income (so if my dad's IRA money is literally coming from my bank account) break any rules? Does it reduce any deductions or credits my father normally claims as a single adult with no dependents and nothing but a checking and savings account? Does the IRS question the source of money contributed into an IRA? Thank you!"
01123581321AhFuckIt,"24, Looking for retirement investment advice... Hi guys, 

I have a Schwab Roth IRA account and plan to invest money in SWYNX, but I find it quite conservative. I'd like to invest in a fund that is heavier in the Information Technology and Consumer Discretionary (or just higher growth/risk) at least till I'm ready to go more conservative. I've been looking at SWTSX and SCHG. I was also interested in FTEC but it's not one of the commission-free ones in Schwab. 

Should I invest 50/50 in SWYNX (Target Retirement Index Fund 2060) and some other fund or ETF like the one mentioned above? Or should I go all on the nontarget retirement ones until I am ready to be more conservative?"
panion87,"I think we only had a car loan at the time 12k and no cc debt. Our interest is under 4% I don't remember exactly. Mortgage itself  is 850ish. We also have ""excellent"" credit and my wife didn't work at time time so it was all my income information."
panion87,"If you can pay it in full, they may just delete it from your history. That's the best route. If not, it'll stay on your report for years but your score should go up if you make steady payments. If you can, pay them both off with one payment. You can haggle a little too so try that. 
I was in a similar situation. I paid them both off and maintained my finances. Now my score is pushing 800. It takes work though. Good luck. "
panion87,"AD AF here. Bought my house 3 years ago through the VA. It cost about 4k when all said and done. Cost of the house was 130k it's now worth 160k and I have tenants that pay my mortgage for me. I make 15k a year extra from my tenants and that pays my property manager too. I did but at a good time though. 

Where are you stationed now? 120k will be about 800 a month so bah should cover it all. 

I like tangible investments myself. And I can move back into my house when I retire so win win.."
lucianbelew,"Compiling resources for a senior family member Hey, y'all. 

My mother in law (lives in Michigan) is in her mid 70s, and was just let go from her professional employment (social worker) because she's no longer able to perform the essential functions of her job. She's been terrible with money, and at this point has, to her name, a lease on a subsidized apartment, enough furniture to fill it, her social security, enough savings to bridge the gap between ss and basic expenses for a half year or so, and a cat. 

We're all she has family-wise, so while she hasn't yet explicitly asked for help, we know it's coming. My partner's relationship with her is extremely strained, and having her move in with us is currently a non-starter, but we're not going to let her starve. So, we're preparing to redirect some of our monthly investment in our own future to the MIL not starving fund. Most likely this will take the form of us assuming her cell phone bill or whatnot, and me setting up a checking account where I deposit a few hundred dollars a month, and she has the debit card. 

When this comes to pass, we're planning on, at the very least, ensuring that she is also taking full advantage of whatever government support she can. I've lived a fortunate life, such that I have no exposure to any welfare or food stamp programs, so I'm a little lost here. I know SNAP exists, and she'll qualify for something there. Is there more out there? 

Along with that, are there subs that might also be helpful with this?

Thanks for any perspective or advice you can give."
lucianbelew,"&gt;You can't get a Roth, and not pay any more taxes on anything that generates, right? ie Take the hit on taxes up front, and then you're free forever on what that generates?

That's literally the point of a Roth account. "
lucianbelew,"How we handled a similar situation - large house with great commons space, 4-5 rooms.  Total rent was split in half.  One half for the common space, the other half then split evenly for each room.  Everyone in the house owes an equal share of the common space half.  Each room comes up with its share of the rent however that shakes out.  

I'm sure there are ways to optimize the allocation a little further, but everyone was satisfied with the arrangement and the bills got paid."
lucianbelew,"It's just really unusual for anyone to care about visa vs mastercard. No I know why you do.

You'll probably have to apply for a different card, from a different bank, that only deals in MC to make this happen. "
524whatDoesThisMean,"Your post is really confusing, so I’m not sure I understand everything. But with some balance transfers you can just deposit the money directly into a checking account. You should just call the number on the back of the card and have them explain it to you. All companies have different terms and conditions. "
524whatDoesThisMean,"He means that the IRS doesn’t recognize crypto to crypto as an exchange as of 2018. There used to be a “tax loophole” where crypto-crypto qualifies under a LKE (like kind exchange). As far as the IRS is concerned, a crypto-crypto “exchange” is a sale for gain/loss"
524whatDoesThisMean,"Generally, it won't hurt to ask. There's always a possibility that your offer is rescinded, but that's unlikely. Just tell them about the value that you bring to the company.

iluvcats17,I would leave it in a savings account until you figure out your life.  You could use it for trade school or college.  If you invest it you could lose your money if the market goes down and then you would not have it when you need it.  I would not invest it until you know that you won’t need it for at least five years and you are not in that situation now.
iluvcats17,"If they knew it would be paid they would of waited on payment to be paid.  They had you pay first so that if it was not paid that you would have to chase after the insurance to get anything reimbursed instead of them.

In the future I would not pay for a procedure.  Insist that they bill the insurance.  If the dentist refuses then you know something is fishy and go elsewhere.

Now that you went anyways I would see what coverage you have for out of network providers.  It should be something.  Then you will have to submit the claim as an out of network provider and hope for some kind of reimbursement.  You are responsible for paying whatever you can’t get the insurance to reimburse you for.  I would cut back on other expenses to get the credit card paid off."
iluvcats17,I use credit karma.  I check the app once a month.  Once a year sounds like too long to me because a lot can happen in a year.  I also check my bank account online a few times a week.
iluvcats17,If you have any debts I would pay them off first.  Then out at least 15 percent into your work’s retirement plan.  And create a budget for the rest of your income so that you have control over your money.  Perhaps open a regular savings account to save for a downpayment for a house but continue to contribute 15 percent to retirement.
iluvcats17,"You need to get on a budget ASAP and not act so powerless over your debt.  Why is it that you can’t change your habits now before you graduate?

Then after you graduate hopefully you will land the job that you are expecting.  I would live like a broke college student and throw every dollar that you can at the student loans debts until they are gone."
iluvcats17,I would get a job ASAP and start making payments. Or take a semester off and work two jobs and save as much money as you can to pay for your next semester and to have extra in savings for books and other incidentals.  Make sure that you get grief counseling too so that you can be successful when you return to school.
iluvcats17,"I would save up for their college expenses and teach them budgeting and how to be independent.  You should not be paying for more then college or trade school once they graduate.  Otherwise you are hurting them rather than helping them if they do not learn how to support themselves.

Also make sure you are saving for your retirement so that you are not poor when you retire and become a financial burden to your children one day."
iluvcats17,"I would save up for a replacement and for now just get it repaired.  If it can’t be repaired buying a window AC unit for your bedroom and living room and use that until you can afford to replace the whole system.

I would get multiple quotes too to make sure that you are not getting ripped off and you will see a big difference in quotes.  Do not finance it."
iluvcats17,I would not co sign for anyone.  It will be a disaster for the co signer if she can’t make the payments because of a change in circumstances later.  It will also tarnish the family relationship.  Let her buy a cheap used car in cash for a few thousand and then save up for a better car.
iluvcats17,"Not everyone in the household has their name on the electric bill.  Perhaps you could see what else could be a proof of residency and see if there is a way for him to get it.

Or find a job for yourself which includes health insurance and since he is a student and under 26 get him on your insurance.  Or go to whatever is considered the poor person medical clinic in your area where the rates will be lower than the private surgeons you are using now.  You may have some tough choices ahead."
iluvcats17,Unfortunately $20 will not even make a dent in credit card interest. If more hours are not possible then work hard to find a second job for the summer.  It will make your last semester easier to not have money stress.  Best of luck to you!
iluvcats17,"I would use an insurance broker and buy term life insurance unless you have cancer or another condition which makes you uninsurable now.  You will find that it is much cheaper than whole life insurance.  I used Zander insurance to find my 20 year term insurance for much less than you are paying.  I just recently paid my annual premium of 251.00 for my term policy.  You are almost paying that per month.

Meal planning is the best way to cut back on eating out.  If you plan out your meals before going to the grocery store and do meal prep at home, it will save you from grabbing convenience foods.

Also what is with the jewelry purchase? If you can’t afford to buy it upfront then you really should save up for it or do without it in the future.  Especially for jewelry which is not needed. That is a luxury and you should only buy luxuries when you can afford them.  That money could be better spent in a 529 for your children’s future college education."
iluvcats17,Pay off the debts today and stop using the cards.  Only charge what you can afford to pay off when the statement comes.  Paying the minims does not count.  If you can’t pay off the entire balance the same month that the statement comes in then cut up the cards and cancel them to keep yourself from going back into debt all over again.
iluvcats17,"Not paying your rent on time is going to be a bigger deal than the low credit score.  Honestly that was super dumb of you.  I am a landlord and I would personally never accept anyone whom has a history of late payments to a landlord.  I do not care about the reason.

You will probably just have to take an apartment in the less desirable section of your town where they may be less selective.  Make sure that you pay your rent on time every month so that when you have your next landlord check you pass it.  You may need to live there two years because your next new landlord may check with your previous two landlords if you are only living somewhere one year."
iluvcats17,They can’t retire now. They both need to find a job and live as cheaply as they can. Perhaps even sell their house and move to a house or apartment which they can buy with the equity in their current home.  Surviving retirement is more doable if they do not have a house payment to worry about.
iluvcats17,I would just take anything that is sentimental and leave the rest behind.  The new furniture may not fit in your new place and it is a lot of expense and hassle to move a great distance with a lot of stuff.  Even moving locally is a huge hassle.
iluvcats17,"I would keen driving whatever you are driving until you have saved up the money for the truck.  If you do not have anything to drive then Uber.  If that is not an option then buy a vehicle with the 2000 grand that you have and keep saving until you can buy the truck you actually want.  Then sell the $2,000 vehicle and combine it with your savings to buy what you prefer to drive.  I would not take a loan on a truck if you want to have money.  Paying on a car loans limits your wealth possibilities."
iluvcats17,"I would forget about the fence and the grading until you have an emergency fund saved.  10000 is the minimum I would save.

I had a privacy fence installed where I am and it cost about 6 grand.  It was worth the cost but I had 30,000 to 40,000 in the bank at the time (I forget exactly how much now).  I would of waited a long time for the fence though if I only had 3 grand in an emergency fund.  So save up a good emergency fund plus the cost of the upgrades that you want before doing any upgrades.

You need the emergency fund for more emergency issues such as job loss, sick kid, car repair, broken water heater, etc.  Don’t squander it on non-emergencies.  If you want upgrades bad enough you will need to find out a way to increase your income with a second job or a better paying job.

Also to add if your mother in law works then she needs to contribute more than a light bill.  I would negotiate a higher amount of money unless your wife is going to work.  If your wife wants to stay home to take care of he kids then you will need income from somewhere.  Perhaps your wife could also babysit other kids In your home such as after school care or looking after a baby for a working mom for extra money."
iluvcats17,"You mentioned having good credit so I would take out a loan to cover the difference between what you owe on it and what you can sell it for and sell it ASAP.  If you let them repo it, it will damage your credit a lot and you will be responsible for the cost after they sell it and they will sell it for a big loss so you will then owe a lot more money and you will have it on your credit report.

You could also offer a lot of money to a friend or a friend of a friend to store it in their driveway for 30 days to give you more time to do this.  But don’t wait the entire 30 days and try to get this sorted out in the next two weeks.  You mentioned that others backed out so perhaps you did not make it worth the hassle.  Money usually fixes that. Perhaps double whatever you were offering to pay and if you did not offer money ask them what they think a driveway storage fee would be and pay them that.  Maybe you have a friend whom is broke or wants to pay for their kids graduation photos and could use some extra money. Or perhaps a friend knows someone in that situation.

Edit:  look up your car’s value on Kelly blue book."
iluvcats17,"I would live your life as if you will never get an inheritance.  The way your mother is secretive about things and seems to have had financial problems in the past leads me to believe that you will get nothing or very little.  All of their debts will have to be paid from their estate before your brother can divy up their money or any proceeds from a house sale.  Even if they have some money now, it could also be spent on health care expenses which often happens if either of your parents end up with a chronic condition.

Figure out how to get your own financial house in order.  If you do end up getting something later it will be like an unexpected surprise at that point.  I would not bring it up with them."
iluvcats17,"What did they charge?  There is a big difference between charging a vacation, new clothes, furniture versus medical bills.  I would hesitate to get involved unless they have dementia or were victims of fraud.  They need to live with the consequences of their choice to charge up 10 grand.  I would not risk their house by taking out a heloc or a second mortgage.

If they can’t afford all of their expenses because they did not save enough for retirement, perhaps they can sell their house, buy a small house or apartment, use the proceeds to pay off their debts and put the rest away for the future.  That money could supplement their savings.  They may have to make hard choices if they can’t work and do not have enough saved to support themselves.

Also to add, help them to pull both of their credit reports to see if 10 grand is truly all of the debts that they have.  One or both of them may not be truthful about the amount of debt due to feeling shame around it."
iluvcats17,Your gf is a slow learner.  She got into her current mess by buying a new car and now she would not mind another new car?  She needs to cut non essential expenses and pay down her car loan.  Continue getting the car fixed when something breaks.  Then either drive it until the engine dies or save up for a used vehicle and after she buys the used vehicle and has her current loan paid down to the value of the vehicle then she can sell it and get rid of the loan all together.
iluvcats17,"Your debt is doable.  Then you can work on funding more in your retirement account.  If you can continue to avoid debt you should be fine in retirement.  It is excellent that you do not have a car loan or student loans since you will be able to get out of debt fast.

The only other thing I would think about is saving a downpayment to buy an apartment or a house.  That way in retirement you can have a paid for home and just need to cover taxes and other life expenses."
iluvcats17,"If you are buying a house I may reconsider going back to school now. I would think you would need to work a lot to be able to pay for the new house and another degree is going to slow you down with being able to work a lot.  Also you already have one degree that you have not paid for.  

Have you figured out what career you want long term and spoken to someone in that field to get their advice?  I have known people whom go
To school For many years, almost like a professional college student, and when they finally finish they are working a 50,000 a year job but have hundreds of thousands of Debt.  They are now broke because just paying the minimums of their debts takes up most of their income.

Considering that you already have debts from one degree and are building a house I would really evaluate if going to school for another degree is the best use of your money and time?  And you will need to pay up whatever payments you owe for the last few months to get yourself out of default status."
iluvcats17,I would refinance since the balance is so high and get on a plan to pay it off much faster than you are.  Perhaps you can live off a lot less money and throw a lot of your income or your wife’s income towards the student loans.  You want to get these paid off so that you do not have them until retirement.
iluvcats17,"I would not do this.  It will be complicated to share it especially if you break up.  If you want a car save up and buy one.  He can also do the same.  This is especially true since you used to love together and no longer do, especially since you live close enough that you would think of sharing a car. To me that demonstrates relationship problems to take a step back so I would not get more tire to him by co owning a car."
iluvcats17,"Is there a way you can find a higher paying job since you are limited with your work hours because of your visa?  Or lower your housing costs.  Perhaps share a room with someone else to save on costs?

Also you can’t afford to send money home if you can’t pay for school.  Unless you can come up with the money from working or from relatives it seems to me that you will be forced to return home.  Is there such a concept as scholarships for foreign students?"
Eag1e11,"What else besides VTSAX in Vanguard? And other clarifications. I have no debt and been reading up on what to do with my savings. I'm late to the party (28) and decided on a Roth IRA account with Vanguard since my employer doesn't offer 401k matching. If I understand correctly, Target retirement is okay but not the first recommendation because of fees and not being as growth orientated as a custom portfolio; ETF's are good if you don't have a lot to invest initially; Mutual funds are best if you are able to get admiral status despite the small fees associated with it and there is some ""managing"" going on in mutual funds. So based on that I have the funds for mutual funds so I will be going with VTSAX. I have read something about 3 fund portfolios and diversifying, but can't seem to find what people would recommend besides VTSAX, so what else is there? If I put the full 5,500 into VTSAX will I be easily able to reallocate some funds from there to a different mutual fund or ETF if I want to diversify my portfolio in the future? Lastly, is there anything tax related I need to fill out since I'm just in the process of opening this account? My total Gross income in 2018 was 5833 since I started my job mid year, and I didn't get another paycheck until Jan 2019, I'm just worried that I may have put too much in my Roth IRA for the 2018 year. I will gladly answer any other questions and will take any other financial advice I may be overlooking. Tried to make it as to the point as possible."
Eag1e11,"I'm not sure, that would be an important question to ask them though. Say you always paid off your card on time and that gave you a nice credit history. From what I understand, if you close that credit account that history will be lost with it. Due to this, I would think that they would probably just change your account to a normal credit line or whatever you choose when the time came."
Eag1e11,"Sorry I am new to all this but are total us, international, and bond stock market index ETFs or Mutual Funds, and what are their abbreviations? I read that VTSAX has some presence in the international stock so it would be a bit redundant to have both of these. And bonds have less growth. So would 90 VTSAX 10 Bonds be a good ratio for now? I'm sure I could contribute the other 6k in a couple of months, so I could avoid the target date fees and still be able to diversify."
Eag1e11,"I know what you mean. My weakness is food, like, I don't need to eat out, but food is so good haha I would save so much money if I wasn't so lazy to cook, or learned how to cook more variety of dishes. I still manage to make more than I spend though, so there's that."
Eag1e11,"An alternative plan if the new job really will give you 6 figures, then you shouldn't have a problem. Make minimal payments on the debt and save up money for public transportation into the city, or a moving truck. With your savings you could use uber/lift/taxi (or public transportation to really save money, or maybe you're able to carpool after a few weeks of working your new job) of your choice temporarily until your income starts rolling in. Once it does you shouldn't have any problem paying off your debt aggressively, and using taxi services. Once debt is paid off, saving for a used car. And then saving for a new car if that's what you really want. If you are frugal, your first plan you mentioned is a good one."
Eag1e11,"Nice, thanks for all this info. And here I was this whole time thinking indexes were a whole different thing. So index is a broad term used for both ETFs and Mutual funds? I think my risk level is moderate to high since I am 28 years old, just never put thought into when I want to retire. Sounds like 80 US 20 International should probably be where to start? Only going heavily into VTSAX because that's the highest recommendation I've seen by far on PF. I'm sure I have the discipline to not do anything crazy if things go bad. Although I wouldn't know if things were going bad or not haha plan is to just leave everything in there for as long as possible to get that average 6 or 7 percentage growth and compounding interests."
Eag1e11,"I was gonna recommend the Discover It Secured Card, but you may want to look at the student versions instead. Looking at the website I don't know if the student cards have any annual fees, but I know the Secured card doesn't have any fees, and it offers 2% cash back at restaurants and on gas, and 1% on everything else. If you don't get approved for a Student Card, you shouldn't have any problems getting approved for a secured card instead. Heck, you might even want to try getting both because the student card seems to only do 5% in one category for while and then it changes to a different category. Then when the category is different from your needs, you just use the secured card. What ever you choose, I would recommend starting off with a card that has no annual fees. Look up Graham Stephan on youtube."
Eag1e11,"It depends on how much you make. You seem to be in quite a pinch. Ally has an okay savings APY if you need a place to put money for a bit while you do more research on savings accounts later on. Definitely make extra payments on the 40k to pay it off asap. At least keep 3 months worth of expenses set aside for a time of need to give you time to get back on your feet if something were to ever come up. Once the 40k is paid off you can look to saving for retirement with 401k if your employer offers matching. If they don't offer matching you can then research a Roth IRA account instead. With all this said, work to increase your income so you'll have an easier time saving up for the 90k when the time comes that you are ready to have your child. This is the bare minimum to saving for retirement that I know of, do your research for your other options and a HSA might also be something for you to look into."
Eag1e11,"So did you open up an account with them? I was gonna go with  Marcus by Goldman Sachs and try out their 2.35% no penalty CD, but then I saw that you get an Actual Card with All America Bank. Seems especially good as a place to put EF knowing that you will be able to access funds with their card."
Eag1e11,"You are totally right about DR's methodology, it IS for people who have a real problem with money. If you have the discipline to stick to a plan and come out ahead with more money, then by all means execute it. I use to have the same mindset about credit cards and I stayed away from them for the longest time because of DR. After doing some reading on different opinions and such, I recently started a credit line because I also didn't think I was someone that needed to go to such extremes. His method is effective because it keeps people focused and less likely to derail. 

I wasn't sure how your bonus worked so I just did 70k/12 which is just below 6k, so that's how I got that. 

If you really want to keep the car then yeah, it's doable. I would just make sure I paid off the CC before interest starts on that, so that would be 400 a month to that to pay off by Feb. Throw everything extra at the car and just do minimum payments on the student loan. Lastly throw everything at the student loan when car and cc are paid off, best to focus on one at a time.

I think postponing retirement for a year isn't so bad. That's just the cost to have peace of mind sooner rather than later. It's more about increasing morale so that when you throw extra money at the debts you can see progress being made and are more likely to continue with your plan. Keeping the car and continuing to add to your retirement are both doable and if you want to you could do it. The only drawback is that you'll be in a lock longer than if you were to switch things up."
Eag1e11,"First easy thing you can do is move your money some where with a higher APY. All America Bank has a Money Market Account with 2.5% apy with no fees applied. Don't let the Money Market part throw you off, it's just like a savings account. Only, you get a card linked to the account and can use it to access the funds. Like a savings account you are limited to 6 transactions without fees. If you are unsure, just go with Ally because a lot of people recommend it so it's a safe bet. Do this first and then continue your research later on. Next, you want to ask your employer if they offer 401k matching, if they do, do more research about it and deposit the maximum they will match. Just 2 weeks ago I didn't know what investing looked like either, so don't worry, if I can figure it out, so can you! After your 401k you will want to research what you can about ROTH IRA, this is where you invest savings for retirement. There are different companies to do this with and I went with Vanguard. It's more simple to do and setup than it is to understand how it works. Check out Stephan Graham Stephan on youtube, he made it much more understandable for me in many different financial areas. Now that all of this is done, you can look more extensively into a better savings account. After all this is done, it's just about budgeting, saving for retirement, and increasing your income."
Eag1e11,"Pay off the debt, believe me, I feel you pain. I had 17.5k in savings but owed 8k on my car so I just paid it off. To top it off I invested 5500 of it into my ROTH IRA so I have around 4k left, which would be around how much you would have left if you paid it off haha Besides, there's no where you can park that money and get a crazy return for it in only 5 years, that's a relatively short amount of time when you want money to grow somewhere. It's better for you to try to increase your income in the next 5 years rather than worry and try to rely on a couple thousand dollars. Also, don't incur anymore debt, that's what got you down in the first place. Don't spend more than you make, stop using credit cards for a while if they tempt you to do this."
Eag1e11,"If you could get out of the car payment by selling it for what's left on it, I think that would be a smart choice. Does your boyfriend have a car that you could share, or maybe a co-worker/classmate you could carpool with; you could offer to pitch in for some gas. If you live in the city you could look at public transportation, or a combination of all these things I've suggested. You're on track to making 14000ish this year and your car+insurance is more than half that, which is not efficient. You could save so much money getting rid of the car and finding a work around."
Eag1e11,"Hey sorry for the late reply, but there shouldn't be any problems at all. Just make sure the new bank is legit. I recently went with Marcus by Goldman Sachs and my only gripe with them is that is takes 5 days for the funds to transfer into the bank, before they become available for  you to transfer them out to a different bank or main checking account. All the banks have different ways of doing things, I just suggested Ally because of it's popularity on here. I went with Marcus for it's slightly higher APY and option to do a CD that you can close early with no penalties. I really really want All America Bank though to have immediate access to my funds with their card and one of the best APYs I've seen from my research. My problem is my address isn't being accepted when I apply online. So until I get that figured out I decided to go with marcus temporarily."
Eag1e11,"Since you are familiar with Dave Ramsey I will tell you what he would suggest. First of all sell the car, hands down, no question about it; then buy a used car that's at least 4 years old to get by with. With that done you could probably use your savings to buy a used car, and have +650 a month not worrying about a car payment. DR suggests a temporary EF of 1000 to start with. He also suggests you temporarily put a stop to retirement investments while trying to get out of debt, so you will have another 500 to work with if you were to stop with the 401k and HSA. Take a look at your subscriptions and see if you are actually using all of them, if you aren't, cancel some (no biggie if you are using all of them and don't want to cancel them though). I would make a payment plan so that your CC is paid off before any interest is accrued onto it, any thing extra/leftover from all the suggestions I gave you, throw it at the student debt. 90k a year is good, with all the suggestions I gave you, you should be able to to pay off your student loan debt in at least 12 months. 90k a year should at least be 6k a month minus 2k for expenses, you should be able to throw 4k a month to your debt. If you're paranoid about an EF, 6k should be enough to fulfill your needs for 3 months. Renting temporarily while getting out of debt is no problem. So instead of saving for a house you could be putting that money towards debt as well. In a year when you have no expenses, you could easily be saving 3k a month towards a new house while still having money leftover to have fun."
spirosand,"$2000 in two years is way less than any car payment for a new car. If you have the money, by all means buy a new car, but don't do it to avoid repair costs, that is false economy.

 In fact, start putting the future car payment ($300\month for a decent car) into a savings account right now. Use that money for repairs, then buy with cash once you've saved enough."
spirosand,"Oklahoma and Colorado aren't the same at all. You will get run over if you bike on the roads. There is almost nothing to climb, and the hiking is limited to state parks, which are few and far between. Plus it's either 100 degrees and windy, or 20 degrees and windy. I think the main pastime there is drinking beer at a bar.

PrettyBrownEyes24,"Well i am a college graduate working entry level right now with $17.15/hour (once my raise kicks in next month) and i’ve got about $17k in the bank not including savings (i’ve got a few different accounts of allocated money throughout different areas due to a parents untimely passing). Cost of living is pretty low, i can get a safe apartment for $590 here. I do want to purse a masters but I havent figured out my exact route yet based on my interests (torn in between two routes and dont want to make a rush decision). Been living back at home with family for 2 years after school but i am thankful for them helping me but i feel like I need growth and independence right now, the apartment I want to view is literally a mile down the road. Guess im just overthinking."
PrettyBrownEyes24,"Apartment Budgeting Tips Good afternoon! I posted a couple of times recently and I finally received word today that I’ve been approved for my first apartment. Now the transition begins. Rent and utilities will be around 25% of my monthly income. What are some ways I can keep my utilities down as much as possible without being too frugal? What needs to be bought first (besides a bedset which I will take my current one from home), and what are some good ways and good places to buy essentials on a budget? What are some ways to keep grocery costs down? Thanks in advance!"
PrettyBrownEyes24,"I live in the state with the lowest cost of living so i know many who make less and are able to get a decent apartment for $500 or so. I try not eat out as much as is even though I live at home. I have a $216 monthly car nots to build credit, but thats all. No student loans. Credit score is about 653. "
PrettyBrownEyes24,"Depending on where in Louisiana you should be able to get an income based apartment. Im in AR, cost of living is very low in my city. I wouldn’t pay lower than $505 a month for a safe-ish one here, but they have some income based ones that are livable. Although you need to be careful in some areas."
PrettyBrownEyes24,"Why would they say I have too many inquiries on my credit report? So i went to set up my utilities today and there was a note saying that there were too many inquiries on my credit report. However, my only line of credit is a car loan I opened in January of last year, i’ve had no missed payments, and havent applied for a credit card. They ran my credit for the apartment but i only put in one application. Why would this be the case?"
PrettyBrownEyes24,"That’s true. It’s going to be a tough choice. But i feel like I’ve stalemated at my other position in the company cause I learned most of everything I could for the position, I’ve even trained my other coworkers on the job because i have been there the longest out of the team of 3 of us."
PrettyBrownEyes24,"I’ll have to check on the match. My hesitation is that i feel like I wont be at that job forever so I didnt know if it would be good to start that yet. I know I would be saving over $1,000 a month anymore, but i feel like right now getting my own place would eventually be to my benefit overall. And the apartment is only a mile from home. I kept all the money in checking because I wanted as much as possible. People may tell me to save for a house but that’s more of a long term goal for me. I can cook so I would only eat out on weekends if that."
PrettyBrownEyes24,"It’s gets to a point where you need your space for your own personal growth and sanity. Im the same age, already graduated college, and have been in a stable job for over a year. It’s gets to be time."
PrettyBrownEyes24,"Do I have enough to manage an apartment? Hello, I am a 24 year old who graduated in 2017 and have been working a stable job for 13 months now. I make $16.82 an hour and I work 40 hours a week, and get two weeks of paid vacation a year. I really want to move out my grandparents house. I have $16K in my bank account and the rent of the apartment I like is $605 (cost of living is quite low where I live), and utilities for a 1bed1bath probably wont be higher than $100, although this apartment includes water in the rent. I may be going for a promotion soon that would be on salary and close to 40k, which would require me to have a home office and one reason for needing to move out other than privacy. Do you think i would be okay at this point?"
PrettyBrownEyes24,"On a logical note How much money do you realistically think someone needs to have to their name in order to move out? Assuming someone lived in an area like the South where housing is a little cheaper than up North, factoring in no debts other than monthly car loan/car insurance?"
PrettyBrownEyes24,I’m about to get my own place but I was able to use my car note to build my credit. No credit card. Its a 706 at the moment. I say maybe get a credit that will be simple to pay off for you and use it for little things like gas and groceries.
PrettyBrownEyes24,I didnt have credit either after I graduated cause I had no loans or bills but I bought a car last year and paying my car note for a little over a year has gave me a decent credit score. You may need a guarantor if your SO doesnt have a good score. 
PrettyBrownEyes24,"The position has been open for a minute but not too may have applied. Its between this and another position and this one is not as stressful as the other, but I wonder about the pay. Just didn’t come across as condensing or pushy."
PrettyBrownEyes24,"When to notify my supervisor of applying for an internal position? Hey everyone! Earlier this week I posted on here about considering applying for another job within my company because I have grown out of my current customer service job. I’ve decided I want to apply for the position. I have my application and resume ready, I just wonder if I need to tell my current supervisor before or after I actually submit it. I’m not particularly fond of her, so we dont have the best relationship but its not horrible. I wanted to submit it this weekend, but should I wait for Monday to do so? Are bosses usually notified right after applying?"
PrettyBrownEyes24,"And unless you are near a large, more advanced market, then even getting an internship is hard to come by. I went to career fairs in college, and majority of the time the internships were in Buisness, and I was in healthcare. I didn’t find business interesting as a subject. I know how depressed I was after a few months out of school cause I had a pretty good GPA in a tough major, and I couldn’t find a job more than $10-$12 an hour. Even my current $17.15/hr job is no where near my caliber. It’s very tough."
PrettyBrownEyes24,"If its 3 times the rent, you are BARELY in that threshold. 930x3=2,790. Thats not a lot of wiggle room at all so it will be a toss up. May need a guarantor to be safe.  Really will depend on how straightforward forward they are with the requirements."
TUSM_or_bust,"Is negotiation necessary? I am a recent college grad and was just offered a position as an entry level Associate Project Manager for a software company that specializes in clinical trials. The salary is 50,000 with a 10% yearly bonus. 31 PTO days (which you are encouraged to take), free catered breakfast and lunch, work from home option when I would like, and flexspend account for transportation costs. 

I’m still in the process of getting my license so the reimbursement for the transportation costs is a great plus for me. And I plan on applying for medical school next year so the flexible PTO is a huge plus for me. 

My question is: given that the compensation is above average for my location (ave=48,000) plus the benefits are already competitive, is it worth negotiating for a high salary? I’ve heard that “you should never take the first offer given” but I’m not quite sure if I should heed that advice. 

Thanks for any input you have!!  

EDIT: I decided to negotiate rather than take the initial offer and they responded to my counter offer of $55,000 with a sign on bonus of $5,000! Thanks to everyone for your input! I’m glad I took that intiative and it was definitely a great learning lesson to advocate for myself"
TUSM_or_bust,"From what what I’ve researched on Glassdoor, LinkedIn and Payscale, $50,000 is the standard as well as the benefits package. I may not have direct project management experience in a company setting but I designed, executed and managed my own research project for 3 years as an undergrad and trained the students below and found the funding for the project. Got 2 first author manuscript publications out of it too....So I have transferable skills. I think I can leverage that "
TUSM_or_bust,"That’s true. I don’t want to be complacent but it’s a great offer as is. Maybe I’ll consider a counter offer of $55,000 since the Glassdoor reviews did say that the range for this specific company is $50-60,000 and I don’t have much to lose. I don’t want to miss out on additional compensation....just didn’t want to come across as greedy"
TUSM_or_bust,"Thank you! And thanks for the advice. That’s exactly what I’m going to do. I’m going to treat myself to a nice dinner, buy some business casual work clothes to add to my wardrobe, pay off my credit card and put the rest in a high yield savings account. That’s a great perspective about remember this win for future promotions and job opportunities. "
TUSM_or_bust,"I’d really kick myself if they rescinded the job offer because of my counter offer but I have another job lined up. Less lucrative and not what I really want to be doing but it’s a job. I think the most probable scenario though if I ask for let’s say $55,000 would be a firm stance on the $50,000 or a counter offer in the middle "
TUSM_or_bust,"Very true. This salary as is would be ideal for me to be able to establish an emergency fund and start again for medical school applications, as well as contribute to a Roth IRA, have money for traveling and expenses and give my parents something each month since I live at home rent free. I’m really happy with this salary to be honest...but idk if I’m being complacent by not asking for 3-5,000 more just to see. "
TUSM_or_bust,I know that it doesn’t roll over but I’m not sure if I can cash out on the PTO. So I will ask that question when I discuss with HR in 2 days. They do encourage you to use it and approve it generously so I honestly believe I’ll use it all but it would be great to have the option to cash out remaining days at the end of the year. Thanks for mentioning that 
TUSM_or_bust,"Thanks for this! I just sent an email asking if there is flexibility with the $50,000 offer since my research showed that the average compensation at the entry lelvel in this area is $56,000. I’ll see what they say back! Idk why I feel so nervous that countering the offer is rude or ungrateful but you’re right, worse case they say no and I take the job anyway and thank them for the opportunity. 

I don’t quite understand what a sign on bonus is for exactly. If I ask for that, I should have a reason for my request right? since I’m not relocating, what other reason is there usually to justify a sign on bonus. 

Thanks again for your insight "
TUSM_or_bust,"$5000 might not seem like a lot to you but that different is not neglible to me and I think it’s a fair increase to negotiate...its not like I would ask for $10-20,000 more that’s ludicrous. In my case it worked out well and I’ll use a similar approach in the future "
TUSM_or_bust,"Well you’re entitled to your opinion and I’m entitled to respond. I think from an entry level position $50,000 is perfectly suitable but I wanted to see if there was flexibility in that. The offer they gave me is right on par with the average salary for this position also on top of having better benefits than other positions I’ve applied for. Either way, whether they gave me a bonus/salary increase or not, I got a good deal so I’m not at a a loss. So once again, I don’t see how “penny pinching” comes into play but that’s your insight. "
TUSM_or_bust,"Thanks for this! Would this be too forward: I believe my experience aligns well with the mission of your company and I very much appreciate the work culture and opportunity for learning and growth associated with this position. However, I have received an offer from another company of $55,000 and would like to know if there any flexibility in matching this compensation? "
champaaagnemami,"I checked and the amendment is due to my fathers retirement/social security and erasure of debt(??). 
I have also looked at the low income clinics and the closest one is about 50 miles away. Is it worth still giving the IRS a call? "
champaaagnemami,"Well in that year they sold the family house to pay off their debts, so my guess this is what is causing it? I told her to get it amended with Jackson Hewitt to see what they said but they filled with them and that’s why we’re confused they made a major mistake like this. "
champaaagnemami,"is it safe to use my savings account as my direct deposit account I am a waitress so generally speaking I do not make anything off of a paycheck, but my employer requires me to set up a direct deposit if I were to have anything left on a paycheck. I didn't think that much into it, but I was wondering if it would be safe to give them my savings account or my checkings account? I do not use my checkings/debit other than to pay off my credit cards so I didn't think twice to give them my account and routing number for my savings account? Would it be safer to have them use my checkings account instead?"
champaaagnemami,It looks like there were a lot of underreported deductions/income/taxable income. Which is confusing because these look to be heavily underreported. (Taxable income line 43 had that it was shown to be 10k but corrected by the irs is 35k). I am no expert but I am not too sure why a tax expert would miss something that huge. 
champaaagnemami,"What should my mother ask for? My mother is ESL and has no clue how to do this stuff on her own which is why we relied on a tax preparer. I believe she did go back and the accountant essentially just said that she did owe that money. (The amount owed is around 5,500, plus the interest and the penalty. Which is how is got up to that 7k mark. If that information helps). "
champaaagnemami,"Parents owes the irs from 2017 This is for my parents but they don’t know how to use the internet etc. 
Essentially my parents filled for the 2017 tax year with Jackson Hewitt and got $500 back. This week they got a letter from the IRS saying they owe $7k for that year. They have spoken to the person who did their taxes and essentially she said that they do owe (so I’m assuming she messed up). My parents have since separated and the letter was sent to my mother but I’m assuming that it’s directed to the both of them, but my mother has no way to pay that off. Are there any ways she could get help for this? 

Edit: the cause of amendment was due to social security/railroad retirement and erasure of debt. "
champaaagnemami,"Okay I’ll relay that information over. Because it is busy season, my mom and I both work jobs that are not typical 9-5s, and I have midterms, it is so hard to get in touch with them and to get an appointment where we can both go. Next time I see her I’ll have her make the appointment regardless. "
fcspermkanonen,"This does all sound like a pretty weird setup, and I think you would be well served to get a second objective opinion. Look for RIAs and Fiduciaries in your area. 


I would just be upfront about the fact pattern and that you are looking to see if there is a better solution to your situation. A well-managed and reputable firm will definitely look over any statements/information you have and provide an educated opinion. 


Wealth management is like any other service you pay for: shop around and find what works best for you. Definitely do thorough research and due diligence.


Edit: Of course, you will need to coordinate this process with whatever trustees/beneficiaries there may be.  "
fcspermkanonen,"Make sure they are doing a product change. That is to say upgrading your card benefits, but retaining your credit history, etc. Sometimes banks will upgrade you by cancelling your old account/card and issuing a new one. This may effect your credit score (shorter average length of credit, fewer lines of credit)."
fcspermkanonen,"Impossible to know with the information you've provided. 


First off, never try to predict future performance. Even if your advisor is doing a great job, the market will have down years where you lose money.


Beyond that, it all depends on your objectives/priorities. Growth? Wealth preservation? Income generation? Tax efficiency? Impact investing? There are so many variables.


Assuming you are just focused on long-term sustainable growth. Historical growth for the US stock market is just under 10% for pretty much any 15-20 year period (going off of memory here). If you factor in some portion of your portfolio being in bonds I would say you can expect 6-7% growth (again, on average over many years). 


Once you factor in the house and cars, I have no idea what portion of this trust is actually liquid. I would only expect the above growth rate on those liquid assets. "
fcspermkanonen,"From the work you did, I would assume you are a W-2 employee. This is not something you or your employer can choose. If you fullfil certain criteria (you had set hours, they supplied equipment (computer, etc.)) then you were an employee, not a contractor. 


""Jumping ship"" to avoid taxes is not a viable or legal strategy. You owe taxes on your earned income. As an employee you will owe less on the money earned than a contractor would. Pay your taxes!


Sounds like you need to have a chat with your employer and ask for a W-2. It will show $0 withheld, and you will owe a substantial tax payment as well as a penalty for under-witholding. You can either pay the debt in a lump sum or set up a reasonable payment plan with the IRS.


You should also ask your employer for a W-4 (or get one yourself) to adjust your withholding and avoid this in future tax years. 


Edit: To add, I believe your employer will also owe FICA taxes that they should have paid on your behalf throughout the year. Because of this, they may push you to be classified as a contractor which would mean you owe the full FICA amount out of your income. This would not be legal if you meet the criteria to be considered an employee. Stand your ground and report this to the appropriate agencies if necessary. "
fcspermkanonen,"Don't. 100% unequivocally DO NOT do this. You are nowhere near being able to afford a $45k car. Seriously, turn back now!!! 

Edit: As an aside, in addition to this being a terrible idea in general, please do not ever focus on monthly payments as you are considering a loan. Dealerships/banks can structure a loan to make monthly payments very attractive, but you'll be paying it off for an obscene amount of time. Look at the APR, term, and total interest cost over the life of the loan.

Edit 2: If you've been saving $600/mo for a few years, you should have $20k+ towards the down payment. Where is this money? If it truly exists, pay off your debt today and consider using the rest as a down payment on a much more affordable car. Or perhaps the more advisable option is to keep the remaining money in a HYSA as an emergency fund to keep you from going into CC debt again. "
fcspermkanonen,"I think ""excessive"" depends entirely on the account size/assets under management. 1% in management fees is reasonable in many scenarios. 


Edit: I should have read more thoroughly... 1% on liquid assets is reasonable in many scenarios. I would run fast and far away from any advisor trying to charge me on assets they do not manage (house, car, etc.) "
fcspermkanonen,"If you are looking to use the money within the next few years I would not recommend investing in an index fund (stocks, etc). You want a longer time horizon for that type of investment.

Instead, I suggest you look into a High Yield Savings Account. You will want to find one that offers around 2.2% interest. I personally use Ally and am happy with it.

Other viable options include CDs and Money Market accounts. "
HelpMe_PickAUsername,"Do you know how much the charge off was for? If not a couple questions could help us get a rough estimate:

1. When was this vehicle first purchased?

2. About how much was it purchased for?


Hopefully it’s a small amount and you can get the remaining balance after paying the debt to the bank. 

You seriously need to look into your grandmother’s finances. Especially if your brother in law is helping her manage them. "
realEmmetBrickowski,"So if you currently own a home and do not plan to live there but want to retain it and rent it out, my only advice would be to find a reputable property management company. They take a cut out of your profits but are well worth it in my opinion. 

If you plan to go the route of using a VA home loan to buy a house and then rent it out, keep in mind that you have to serve 181 days before you're eligible for the loan (at least last time I checked that was the rule and that's assuming you're active duty). Plus, you have to occupy the residence for one year; you can't turn around after purchase and rent it out. However, if you are also living in the residence (like in a duplex) then you're okay to rent out.  

It's been a while since my experience so I would do further research on this topic if you're serious. Good luck. 

www.military.com is a good resource for questions like this"
realEmmetBrickowski,"By ""rent out"" do you mean that you want to purchase a house and rent it out? Or do you mean that you want to rent a house for yourself to live in? 

Your ""buy and sell"" comment just made it a bit ambiguous. I think I can help you out tho, depending on what you mean."
JustOneAndDone,"I don’t know if she’s learned honestly. This uncle is her 40 year old “baby” I’m sure he’s going to screw her over again. 

Oh and yes. I’m terrified for anyone to touch my credit. My uncle asked me to finance 2 Alexa Dots for him. Fuck no! Go pay that shit on your own. He’s like, I’ll give you the $5 and the $5 every month after. Yeah right!"
JustOneAndDone,"She’s currently remodeling her house. She wanted to get an increase in her Home Depot credit card or open a second one but we are very positive it’s not going to get approved. She always wanted to buy a pickup truck but I don’t want her to drive anymore so that’s something I hope doesn’t happen but I can’t stop her.

She has thoughts about selling her house in Mexico and using that as a down payment for a house here in the US for my mom but I also don’t think it’s going to happen anytime soon if at all.

I’ll talk to her about it when she comes to my house but I don’t know what she wants to do about Walmart. She doesn’t want to pay it because she doesn’t know what the $2,300 came from since my uncle won’t talk. He get mad and leaves if we bring it up."
JustOneAndDone,"I decided to check my grandmas credit score and she has something in collections, how can she recover? So like 6 months ago JCPenny closed her credit card account (it would have been 13 years old this year). I forgot the reason why they closed it but it was around the time 2 things happens. Her car was repossessed and her Walmart credit card was closed and sent to collections. She also left the account sitting for about 4 months. We discovered it was closed when I took her to go shopping. We reapplies and got denied.

Why did this happen, you may be asking? My grandma had perfect credit her entire life. Never missed a payment. Her youngest son asked her to sign a car lease for him. Not co-sign, fully sign on her own. Being the mother she is, she did. He paid! For like 5 months then slacked off... After 7 months of paying and not paying they took the car and sold it in an auction. 

No idea what happened to the car but I’m Credit Karma is shows as paid off but “collection/charged-off”.

Well, while he wasn’t making the car payment but saying he was, he asked her to open a Walmart credit card for him under her name only. He “only” wanted to buy a $400 TV. Well a letter in the mail came I forgot how many months after saying “you owe us ~$2,000” or something and no payment has been received. My grandma called Walmart right away and tried to explain the situation but obviously they aren’t going to spare anyone. So my grandma agreed to close the account to stop the spending.

Now it shows $2,300 in collection from Walmart. The account was opened on July 19, 2017. And credit karma shows this as “needs attention”. My dipshit uncle isn’t going to pay for shit at this point.

Whats the best plan of attack for my grandma here? Her credit score about 5 months ago or so was in the 500’s. It’s currently 641. Her only credit at the moment is:

-Furniture Store Credit (2 years, 5 months)
-Magazine Credit Card (3 years, 2 months)
-Home Depot Credit Card (14 years, 6 months)

That’s it. Also a paid off car lease (no late payments) that was co-signed with my mom, not sure if this helps. 

What can she do about the Walmart collections? And what can she do to improve her credit score? Should she try to open another credit card?"
JustOneAndDone,"As far as I know, there isn’t anything too bad. You just has to be careful not to miss any payment. Some companies are less likely to accept you if you have too many hard pulls but besides that everything should be fine.

I’m planning on coating my car soon plus a couple other expenses. I was planning on doing the same and opening another cc for the bonus and also add to my arsenal or cashback (which is very weak at the moment)"
JustOneAndDone,A credit score is how trust worthy are you. It’s hard to build trust but easy to ruin it. To build your credit scare back up you have to prove you can be trust worthy again. This can take a while to come back up. But just stay on top of everything and you should be able to recover.
JustOneAndDone,"That’s what I use it for only. I already moved to Chase. I just wanted a credit increase for a credit score boost. I already have a few cards in mind I might open around June, I just have to come down to a final pick."
JustOneAndDone,"I have the Wells Fargo College Card, only 1%. I got the card just to have a credit card instead of actually searching up benefits. And for this card, I always pay it a day or two before the due date."
JustOneAndDone,"I applied to WF because it used to be my bank, I don’t think there was a benefit. My gf has Chase and has this same card with them. However, I will say their customer service sorta sucks. They take forever to answer. Discover has their 24/7 customer service, you can message them and they will send you a message within a couple of hours. However, they don’t really accept it everywhere which sorta sucks.

Also, WF cashback can only be redeems in $25 increments. Discover is at the end of every month."
JustOneAndDone,"It’s a very very tough situation. My uncle has screwed over my grandma, mom and great-uncles Credit. According to my grandma he wasn’t like this until a different great uncle took out a loan on this uncles name. He was paying it all the time but he sadly passed and obviously couldn’t keep paying it. So my uncle got screwed in return and now he’s screwing everyone. I don’t think he’s doing it in purpose, I think he just doesn’t care.

He’s also not very nice to my grandmother but he’s 90% of her rides between my house and her house (her house is in Mexico 20 minutes way from me in the U.S.)

Her doctors and everything are over here so she can’t really stay in Mexico. So we sadly have to keep at it with him and it’s my grandma “baby” since he’s the youngest. She’s always going to love him no matter how badly he fucks her over."
JustOneAndDone,"Living situation, she own a house outside the country but usually comes here with me and my mom as her “second house”. Her house in Mexico is 15-20 minutes away from my house but that house in untouchable.

She does not own any vehicles. Her last vehicle was over 10 years ago now. She recently redid her driving test because of the California thing. But she doesn’t drive. My mother, uncle or me drive her places. 

The lease she co-signed with my mom was my moms car. My mom needed the credit because she filed for bankruptcy so my grandma helped. My mom did all the payment and paid it off after 36 months and turned it in without any issues. The vehicle was not bought.

She own no other property."
JustOneAndDone,"I have the student card as well but I don’t trust Autopay ever. I have a just have a reminder to pay off my card 3 days before the due date. It’s going to drop your credit history by half which might have a big impact.

I personally wouldn’t want to close it. But that’s up to you. If you believe WF is going to cause you more trouble and you don’t want to be associated with them then by all mean close it and you’ll recover eventually."
JustOneAndDone,"I got a 2018 Ford Fusion SE 1.5 Ecoboost. I don’t remember the MSRP (2019 equivalent is $24K) but I managed come down to a $19,000 agreed upon value. From this they believed the vehicle will depreciate $7,014 and they will charge me a “renting fee” (standard with all leases) of $963. This means I have to pay nearly $8,000 in 3 years. That’s $221.57 monthly plus tax.

The 2016 Fusion’a rent charge was $1,400 but the depreciation was $1,100 lower. That’s left us with a $201.50 plus tax monthly.

I’m sure the Jetta will hold its value a lot more than a Fusion but try to go off of that.

They are saying the depreciation plus “rent fee” is going to be ~$10,100+"
JustOneAndDone,"How long does Wells Fargo usually take to increase your credit limit? Before I say anything else, I never carry a balance. I always pay it off when the transaction posts or at the end of the month. 

Background: I'm currently 21, full time student and have a part time job.

&amp;#x200B;

So I currently have 3 credit cards. I opened up my Wells Fargo card in September 2017, they gave me $1,000 limit. It's been a year and a half since then. Still at $1,000. Meanwhile I also opened a Discover card also in September 2017. I got a $1,500 credit limit, which was raised twice since then and is now at $3,000. Last year in November I opened up the Chase Amazon card, $4,500 credit limit. Is there any particular reason why WF hasn't increased my limit?

&amp;#x200B;

I don't have any debt besides a car lease which ends in less then 2 years from now. Never missed a payment. I also financed my iPhone twice but that never showed up on my credit so I'm not sure if that counts."
JustOneAndDone,"How much is the payout price? Check if it’s the same or less then KBB. There should be an extra fees.

Also, sometimes it’s way cheaper to buy that exact same car used elsewhere. My lease buyout price is like $15,000 but the car is only worth like $11,000 (most likely less). So my buyout is not worth it."
JustOneAndDone,"I took advantage of the 0% as well, bought a new 4K TV then. Since then I’ve used it up to 50% utilization (but I pay it off at the end of the month). I’m about to get my second $25 credit from the 1% cashback, that’s nearly $5,000 in transactions. "
JustOneAndDone,"There’s many apps that can check your credit score for YOUR view. These are “soft inquires”. They do not hurt your credit. Many companies also use this method to “pre-approve” you for credit cards, loans and so on. 

But when actually applying for something that requires credit. They do a “hard pull” or “hard inquiry” which runs your entire credit history so they can determine if you’re responsible enough for their product. This will drop your credit a couple of point at most (unless you run it a lot) and disappears in 2 years from your credit.

Bonus: when you do a hard pull on your credit for big loans like a car loan for example. You can do multiple within a couple weeks period and they bundle it into 1 hard pull because they give you a “shopping period”. But ONLY for big loans like for cars and houses. If you do get the car/house loan they often bundle it along with the loan and never report it in your credit."
JustOneAndDone,"My Wells Fargo credit card APR is increasing every few months. So I wrote down in my notes what my interest rates are on my credit cards. I think I did this in November or something.

Well I decided to check my statement this month. I have a 16.40% APR, which was odd because I remembered it being 16.15%. I decided to check every month (after my 18 month 0%).

April of last year it was 15.65%
Then in June it went up to 15.90%
Then in October it went up to 16.15%
Then in January it went up to what I have right now, 16.40%

Is this a normal thing? Or what is going on? How would I know when it stops?"
JustOneAndDone,"I saw I got a message from you but I can’t see it. I think it may have been temporarily disabled until mods approve it. But I think I saw what you asked for.

These numbers are from my 2 leased car contracts. The saleman there can show them to you but they don’t really want to show you figures that scare you away. They just show you your monthly payment that’s it. (Or at least they try too)

There’s a website dedicated to giving you the lease vehicle prices but I forgot what it was. It’s been a while. But basically they usually get their depreciation number spot on but you have wiggle room in the “renting” department. Don’t be afraid to back out. Ask them to lower it to a figure you think is good. If they don’t come down, just say thank you and leave. Most of the time they call you back because they don’t believe your bluff. However, there’s a small chance they are going to not call you back but I’m sure they will take their original deal.

Also, try to get those miles to a minimum of 12,000. Their depreciation cost is based on their standard annual mileage (which I believe it’s 12K for VW). I would also advise against accepting any of their “service packages”. We took one for the 2016 Fusion not realizing it’s only a 3 time thing which we paid over $400 (for 3 years) and only got 3 oil changes out of it 1 of which was done without our permission. We took the car in for a warranty issue like 2 months after the previous oil change and they did an oil change...

Just pretend you’re interest in the packages to the salesman. Once you go talk to the actual person that does the contract. Make sure you say no to all their packages (I think GAP is required if not it should come by default and I’m unaware if you can even take it off) but all their other packages, say no to them.

I would also be cautious of the tires near the end of the lease. If they need replacing then they will specifically pick 4 expensive tires and charge you for them. If they do truly need to be replaced, I recommend buying 4 cheap used tires. They work and they can’t complain.

You may or may not need brakes. I would also try to push that back as much as you can and not replacement if you really don’t need too. It is a lease after all, you’re not keeping it and their “rent fee” calculates this into it in case a customer doesn’t replace all their maintenance. This means if they charge a high rent plus they get to charge their customers more, it’s a win win for them. If they don’t then it’s just a small win. They always come out on top. That’s why they make billions.

I may have gone really far away from the main topic. Sorry about that. Final words. I recommend a 36 months lease (39 doesn’t hurt). Get 10K+ yearly miles at minimum. Keep telling them you want a lower offer until they seem annoyed (they will take their time to annoy you in hopes you take a deal and leave). Make sure floor mats, spare tire, owners manual and other stuff is included, they sometime take it out and forget to put it back in and then they charge you for it. Don’t buy any “maintenance” packages. Try to not put any money down on a lease."
JustOneAndDone,"Wait, only 7,500 miles a year? The lowest I’ve seen Volkswagen offer is 12,000. Makes sure they aren’t trying to pull a fast one here. Ford has always offered low yearly mileage of 10,500 while most dealerships have a standard of 12,000. I wouldn’t get it if they are really only offering 7,500."
Beerus1990,"My advice as both a parent and someone who had to rely heavily on mine and my wife's parents when we started out 7 years ago in buying a house in NI and climbing in my career. Just accept it as a loving gift..... There is no point in feeling bad, your parents are doing this to give you the best start. Save as much as you can, continue being frugal and one day when you are reaping the benefits of all of this you can ""pay back"" your parents by looking after them (if they need it)

By the sounds of it they are very money sound themselves so I imagine they have saved and planned for such an event as this. I have 2 savings accounts for both my 4 and 2 year old for just such an event, and all ready have been able to do nice things for both sets of parents. Work hard and enjoy the help, it wont last forever, so appreciate it while it is here"
Beerus1990,"I would take your savings and any extra you have and get rid of that car loan as quickly as possible. Then the money you have been paying off on the car, I would put back into savings every month, plus more if you can.

This is a common let down but having a loan of any type while having savings in a savings account is pretty much a waste. the savings you make a year wont equal what you pay out on the car APR... clear that and already you are in a better financial situation

I wouldn't touch the payments until you are sure you have refinanced and I would stick with the REPAYE scheme as it will financially benefit you. Again once that car loan is gone and you have the extra cash, and anything extra you can afford to save, do it, and you will have a very nice nest egg available for buying a house or whatever may come in the fututre"
Beerus1990,"Not enough to even pay tax. My wife was employed as a cleaner before getting paid £35 a week (like 4 hours work) and dint pay tax even with it going through the gov. I wouldn't worry myself about it. No need to even declare it, as even if you were making a lot more, it would be near impossible for HMRC to even know"
Beerus1990,"This is an odd post because your bills are less than half of your earnings. What happens with all that extra cash?

I personally found a lot of success in moving all of my Direct debits/bills etc. to the 3 days after my pay date. That means after I am payed all my bills get paid and I have my extra to use how I need. If I were you I would use this extra to target your highest interest card, making only the minimum payment on the other 2. Once this one is cleared do the same with the second and then the third. Realistically you should be able to do this in about a year"
Beerus1990,We refinanced our mortgage to use some of the equity to improve the house. We were told in all aspects not to do this. but we managed to increase the value of our house by nearly double. This is a very rare case tho
rockethot,"No need to fear credit cards. You won't get a good interest on a future car loan unless you have an established credit history. Easiest way to establish a credit history would be to open a credit card and put a recurring payment on it, like a phone bill, and pay it off in full monthly. You only hear horror stories from people that were irresponsible with credit."
rockethot,Thanks for your reply. I actually have a bluetooth OBD scanner that I use daily with the Torque android app. I've actually been doing maintenance at a higher frequency than Mini suggests. In their manual they state 10k miles between oil changes. For me that seems like too many miles so I do them every 5k miles.
rockethot,Spend $5k at the most on an a used Toyota Corolla/Camry or Honda Civic/Accord. These cars are reliable and maintenance is cheap. Make sure to get a pre-purchase inspection on a car before buying it. Get a nicer car when you are in a stronger financial position. 
rockethot,With a score like that you'll get an awful interest rate no matter if you buy a new or used car. The best option for you would be to save enough to buy a used car Honda/Toyota for around $5k.
rockethot,"You need to make a budget and stick to it. Your spending is absolutely out of control. With no rent or mortgage, you should have a lot of money left over every month after covering all your necessary expenses. If you don't go the bankruptcy route, consider getting a loan from a local credit union to pay off the credit card debt and stop using your card. The interest rate on that loan would be much lower than what ever your credit card is. If you get your spending under control you could pay off that $20k off in 2 years considering you don't have housing expenses. "
rockethot,"So let me get this straight. You didn't make the payments. They charged you late fees as a result of not making payments. They called to warn you that they would repossess the car. Yet you are somehow surprised they repossessed the car? What did you honestly expect?

Don't use the money for other things if you know you scheduled a payment for your car.

"
rockethot,"If you're making $8400-$9600 a year you can't afford a $10,000 car.  This is more than what you make a year and most likely the reason you are getting denied. You should be looking at buying an older car with cash instead."
rockethot,Looks like you taught him everything you know and on top of that you are providing him with free support when something goes wrong. Stop providing the free support and start applying for other jobs if you haven't already done so.
ajskuce,Well if selling does not pan out you can still cut costs in other places to help get rid of other debt sooner and then snowball it from there ( look up debt snowball/avalanche if you haven't already) also like other comments have said look into IBR or other lower payment methods for the student loans until you can get out from under the other higher rate debts. It will be a long road but if you and your partner stick to it and set realistic goals you will get through it.
ajskuce,"Just keep doing what you are doing, your credit score will go up over time. Unless you are trying to buy a house or car right away your credit score is not that important. 

As to what GL did with your payment, no bank transaction is instant, it always takes a few days to process. Them applying the payment on the 2nd is not abnormal. 

Loans coming out of deferment will always drop your score since a deferred loan is not considered a currently due obligation. Would be nice if the people at TransUnion had explained this instead of just brushing you off.

Keep making your payments and stick with the aggressive schedule you are doing. Though make sure you are setting some emergency savings and retirement savings aside also."
ajskuce,"Don't focus on the yield so much, this money will sit and grow for decades and those yields are just past performance not a guarantee on future performance, it may be higher it may be lower. If you want a simple set and forget IRA then do the target date fund for the year you think you may retire. If you decide in the future you want to be a little more hands on with your IRA investments then you can look up the simple 3 fund portfolio and go with that. Always look at your expense ratios when picking index funds or mutual funds anything higher than 0.1% is garbage and you should really shoot for between 0.04% and 0.1%, there are lower ones but they are with Schwab and fidelity and I recommend sticking with vanguard."
ajskuce,"Sell the cars and get cheaper used cars that are very fuel efficient that will free up 700+ some of your gas expense. Then cut the Y, Netflix, PSV, and get cheaper (slower) internet if possible and drop that ridiculous cell phone plan for something like Google FI or republic wireless. You guys are living like you make 8k/month and need to be willing to cut expenses and live cheaply for a while."
ajskuce,"So ETFs and Index funds can both have low fees, the main difference is most index funds usually have a minimum investment $1000-5000 to invest in them. ETFs can be bought as long as you have enough for one share (no partial shares like index funds either). The favorites on here for platforms are vanguard, fidelity and Schwab but I'm not sure what is available to you in your country. Using a bank or broker will have high fees and eat up any gains."
ajskuce,Keep in mind that if you do a 401k loan and lose your job that money becomes due within 90 days and if not paid by then will count as a withdrawal and be subject to the 10% penalty plus tax.
ajskuce,Pay off everything but the car then set a savings goal for your emergency fund (6 months expenses) once you have that saved pay extra towards the car until it's gone. Then stay out of debt and always pay your CC in full each week/month.
ajskuce,"Step one is you and your fiancee need to talk about your situation and agree that you are in trouble and agree to find a solution together. If you can't agree on this than you will never get out of trouble while you are together, imagine someone digging a hole while someone else is filling it back up. You both need to pull your weight in this, one of you cant do it alone.

Step two is a budget, sit down and write down everything coming in and everything going out for you and your fiancee. look at your list and cut everything that you don't need to live/work. From your post alone there are a lot of subscriptions that you can't afford to be paying. Get cheaper phone plans, I'm talking track phone/prepaid, you guys don't have the income to be paying $110 a month for cell phones. Shop around for cheaper car insurance. Pinch pennys like crazy, minimize your spending and do not buy things unless you absolutely need them. NEVER USE YOUR CREDIT CARDS AGAIN!!!! Pay everything in cash, not even a debit card if you can help it.

Step three is to get out from under those car payments. Normally I would say pay of the credit cards (keep making minimum payments tho) but your car payments are killing you. Put as much of your now freed up money as you can into not being under water on one of the cars, once you break even sell the car and pay off the loan. Replace it with something much much cheaper that is very gas efficient, this is your new commuter car. Now put everything you were putting towards the old car towards the second high car payment and do the same thing. After this put all your extra money towards the credit cards and pay them off. Once these are paid pay off any remaining balance one the new cheaper cars.

Step four is to keep your credit card balance zero and start saving money for an emergency, start with a $1k goal and work towards 6 months expenses. Once you have that treat it like a zero balance, that money is for an emergency.

Through this whole process I would recommend looking into ways to increase your income, working side jobs on weekends, pulling extra shifts at work, w/e you can to help you pay down that debt faster. It is going to be a hard road but it's doable of you stick to it. And when you do get out from under all that debt remember how bad you felt when you had it, learn from that and don't fall back into your old habits."
ajskuce,"Pay the minimums towards all so you stay in good standing and then pay extra towards one of them when you can. There are 2 schools of thought here. Pay extra towards the highest interest rate loan to save the most of interest in the long run, or pay extra towards the lowest balance loan to get it paid off sooner for the phycological boost. Its really up to you. But no matter which you choose, once you get one loan paid off start paying that extra money towards the next loan so you start paying them off faster and faster. Look up debt snowball and debt avalanche for more details."
ajskuce,There is no fast way to increase your credit. Paying off your debt is the only way to increase credit. Make on time payments and extra payments where you can and your credit will go up over time. You could try for a secured credit card with a very low limit that you use for small purchases and pay off in full each month to help add good history to your credit report.
ajskuce,Have you seen the actual quote or is this what the owner is telling you? $3200 is not what it would cost to replace the door must less fix a ding. so I think they are trying to screw you.
ajskuce,"So loans in deferment do not count on your credit score as something you owe or have to make payments on. When your loans came out of deferment you had a sudden increase in debt paired with a very short credit history so you are seen by the formula used for calculating credit scores as a higher credit risk and therefore a lower score. It really doesn't matter though, it's a temporary drop. As long as you continue to make on time payments on your loan and pay off your credit cards in full every month your score will raise with time. If you look at credit karma it will break down what it thinks goes into your score and you will see the impact that ""credit age"" has along with the other factors. And don't put too much stock in credit scores, anything above 740 is just bragging numbers, get a few years of good history and you will be fine."
Retroindigo,"Is it a bad idea to have both of our Roth IRAs in the same fund? My husband's ROTH IRA is with Vanguard in a target account. He also has a 401K with John Hancock. My ROTH 401K is with Fidelity, in a target account. 

  
I want to also open an IRA, and have heard so many good things about Vanguard, specifically the total market index fund. Is it a bad move to put our money (his IRA and mine)  in the same place? I know we should diversify, but I'd rather ""set it and forget it"" essentially.

Additionally, we're considering putting some money into a custodial brokerage account for our kids to save for college. Same question. "
Retroindigo,I have (hope it’s not had!) one with them last year. I thought by saying “waive” I was waiving any personal contribution. Although I realized this week the tax advantages to funding it and that was dumb to do. My account wouldn’t have just disappeared right? It had like $3k in it
Retroindigo,"Thanks. I’m meeting with HR tomorrow. I did contribute in 2018 but not the max amount (which is $7000 for the family, right? Not sure if that includes what the company put in). So, if I can still contribute for 2019 after taxes, can I also contribute now for2018? Say I only put it $3000 last year, would I legally be able to contribute $10,000 this year and write off both contributions when I do taxes in 2020?"
Retroindigo,"Employer’s 401k match is AWFUL. What next ? My husbands 401k match at work is a lousy 1%.  He’s 37 and I am 35. I have a Roth 401k at work and my employer matches 6 percent, but I contribute 15 percent right now and have about $100k in it. We both just opened Roth IRAs in Vanguard, and just opened 529 accounts for our kids. My husband needs to catch up on his own retirement savings, bc he only recently started the 401k and has less than $10k in it. 

Is it worth having him put more of his salary into that account? I’m not sure what the fees are but 1% of his salary is only 500-600$. What’s the next best step for him? 

He also has a mutual fund from when he was a kid. Should we leave that money there or is there a better investment vehicle for his retirement? "
Retroindigo,"Question about funding HSA I’m on an HDHP and have about $3,000 in my HSA from last year. I stupidly didn’t understand the perks of an HSA until this week so, during open enrollment, I selected “waive” on my HSA. -Will that preclude me from contributing to it in 2019? My employers contributes $1000 a year to it (for families). 
-If I can still contribute, what is the max? 
-And, can I retroactively contribute under 2018 like you can do with an IRA? If I can, am I able to do that from my paycheck or would It have to be cash? Which would mean I couldn’t write it off on my taxes, right? (I already filed 2018 taxes too...)

Retroindigo,"How to get custodian off 37 yr old's UGMA account Hi, my husband is 37 and we've been paying taxes on an account he has with Invesco ""diversified dividend fund."" I know basically nothing about investing. However, I do know -- now -- that his mother is still listed as the custodian on the account and its an UGMA account. Is it as simple as calling them to take her off of it so it's not an UGMA account? Or, do we need to close it and then decide whether to reinvest there or move the $ elsewhere? It has a decent amount of $$ in it, but I'm not sure if it's doing well and we should leave it there, or not. "
Frashizzle,"Your question has already been answered. But I've lived this movie before; get prepared to work 80 hours a week.

Some people love that and some people hate it. I hated it. But the key thing to keep in mind about this whole decision is that everything is different with a small company. The stakes are higher. The expectations are higher. Your boss *will* be an asshole because if you don't perform he can't feed his family. 


The dynamics are just totally different. But on the plus side they probably keep beer in the fridge or some silly shit."
Frashizzle,"The reason I'm asking is because co-signing is a very bad decision. It's like you're asking ""which is healthier - crack or pure cocaine.""


The real best answer to the question is to figure out a way where she doesn't have to cosign."
Frashizzle,"First of all, I doubt you're going to get a much better interest rate since this will be totally unsecured debt. Most consolidation loans are effectively mortgages; they give you a good rate because they put a lien against your house and can foreclose if you don't pay. You're asking the bank to give you a loan based just on your word. If you can get that at all, it will be at 18% or so.


And, like you'd predicted, this sounds like a really bad idea. What's going to happen the first time she misses a payment? What's going to happen when she takes a weekend vacation or something and you realize that she could be using that money to pay you off faster? ... It's just an emotional mess; and nobody thinks it's going to happen to them. That's why people do it. But it usually does happen."
Frashizzle,"Your emergency fund is too low and you have the car loans.


Those are really the only two things you should be worried about. With your income, you could finish off the emergency fund and payoff the cars in like a year. That would give you a lot more piece of mind.


But even an emergency fund is temporary. If you get so sick you can't work, it's just an unfortunate fact of life that you might be forced to sell the house or even forced into a bankruptcy/Medicaid situation. But your fear of that really has more to do with your self actualization than personal finance. Consider seeking out ways to get more comfortable with death and the temporary nature of life... that might be the ultimate source of your stress."
Frashizzle,"Well, what do your other options look like? That affects your ability to negotiate here.


If you have other offers on the table (or close to them), you can discuss those with your employer and ask them to guarantee a match to those. 


Conversely, if this is your only option, and you don't care if you move to the midwest, and your employer knows this (or can at least surmise it), then your best option might be just to start the training with question marks around salary and keep your eye out in the meantime for other opportunities in case this one tries to shaft you."
Frashizzle,"I think your personal experience is causing you to overestimate the number of new cars that show noticeable signs of mechanical failure within the first few years.


Furthermore, this isn't answering OP's question. He's asking whether he should buy used or lease new. It would have to be an extreme edge-case in terms of mechanical failure for leasing to be a better option in that case."
Frashizzle,"The lesson here is to pay cash for cars.


You have this car now, so you have no excuse to ever finance one again (you can no longer say ""but I needed a car!"").


Save up, take your time finding a good deal, and pay in cash. That is the lesson here."
Frashizzle,"www.daveramsey.com


His suggestion is to pay off the lowest amounts first. This is *not* mathematically the best option, but what it does is causes you to have 'quick wins' and free-up additional money in your monthly budget to make bigger payments on the other debts.


He would also tell you to evaluate how much you want/need the car and whether a cheaper car would be better, since cars are a depreciating asset."
Frashizzle,"Eh.

I went to a big name school (not going to say the name, but think top 20 nationally).


Looking back, was the big school *better* than my local school? Yes. Would I do it again? Yes. Would I do it again if it cost more than the local school? Probably not.


Nobody in the working world gives a shit about college rankings at all. They only matter to people who haven't gone to college yet and people who are in college. As long as you went to a real, bona fide college and not University of Phoenix or some shit, it's all the same. And unless your roommate is Mark Zuckerberg or something, no one really uses the network or connections. They're just things that help in theory. (Plus, you already said your brother is unmotivated; so there is no reason to expect him to use them).


You pushing him to go to the bigger name school isn't a terrible financial decision. But your parents aren't wrong that it doesn't matter."
Frashizzle,"I am an acolyte of Dave Ramsey. If the mortgage is the only debt you have, he would likely tell you do to #1 but to allocate a percentage of it to do something in the #4 category (without taking additional debt) just because it's a morale booster for yourself and a reward for your accomplishment."
Frashizzle,"&gt;I've been at a big company before and some co-workers just floated by doing minimum amount of work. It effected my own motivation so I hope that wouldn't be the case.


Unless you're working in Wall Street finance, you're never going to escape this. Big companies are a magnet for people who are either lazy or unqualified. A big company is a great place to advance if you're highly self-motivated. But you're always going to be working with a huge middle class of people who are just waiting for their odometer to tick over so they can ask their boss for a raise based on time served. That's unavoidable, so if it bothers you then you're probably not going to like any big company experience."
Frashizzle,"You can Google how to do it exactly; several sites do a good job of describing the process. It varies by state, but basically what happens is:


1. You find the buyer. They may have cash or they may need to use a bank.


2. You and them sign a form (which varies by state) that is basically a contract to complete the purchase once they pay off your lien. There is a 1-2 week window between paying off the lien and getting the title from the bank. This form will serve as like a temporary title for the buyer.


3. The lien holder sends the clean title to either you or the seller, and at that point the transaction is basically complete.


There's not much you have to work out with your bank. All they really care about is getting the money from somewhere. It's up to the seller to arrange with his bank and/or pay in cash. Many people also use what's called an escrow account for the transaction (which is basically just an account where the buyer puts money, and then you get the money after they send the title, just to make sure there isn't fraud in the transaction).


For more information on how much money this will net you, go to kbb.com and look at the difference in value between trade-in and private sale."
Frashizzle,"&gt;a) i know i will be taxed for the reduced amount. what other things outside of getting it in writing should i look out for ?


Pay with a money order or cashier's check. Don't give them electronic access to your checking account. Don't even write them a check as checks have your account number on the bottom.


They will drain the account, and you will have no recourse. (It's not like a judge will rule in your favor if your only defense is ""they took out money I owed them from my account."")"
Frashizzle,"Yeah, I can't say whether this is a test or not. But I've heard many examples of hiring managers taking an interviewee out for lunch specifically for the purpose of seeing whether they're rude to the waiters.


It is definitely possible that this is just a test to see if you think you're too good for an 'everyman' type of hotel."
Frashizzle,"Run the actual numbers, not the monthly numbers, and make your decision.


The Honda Accord retails for something like $24k. Even if you negotiate, you'll probably drive off the lot for something like $26k after taxes and registration.


The new car will lose 20% of its value in the first year. So somewhere around $5k in value.


Maybe I'm just totally mistaken, but it seems to me like you could literally rebuild your current car for the $5k that you'll be losing by purchasing a brand new one."
Frashizzle,"You'll almost definitely net 10-20% more money if you sell it privately rather than trading it in. Private sale with a lien makes a bit more difficult but not impossible.


Trade-ins are convenient because you drive off the lot the same day. But you can afford a lot of freaking cab rids for the $3k+ you'd net by selling privately."
Frashizzle,"And over the course of 5 years, that is only $4k per year. I don't think I've *ever* had a year go by where I didn't spend close to $4k in repairs, upkeep, appliances that would otherwise be covered by a rental, etc.."
Frashizzle,"Well, how much is it actually worth to you to make you move?


When I negotiate, I like to figure-out what my actual numbers are. Don't just go in hoping they will kick in some money just to be nice. That will fail. You need to be prepared to say ""look, if it's not $X, then I'm not going to do it and I'll start looking for other stuff on Indeed."" Don't say it like that, obviously, but you need to have that in your back pocket. You need to know what you actually want first."
Frashizzle,"If I were in your situation, I would save up like $2k in cash: scrimp, claw, and save.


Once you have that, sell the car (assuming you're not underwater) and get a $2k car. There are plenty of $2k cars to get from point A to point B."
Frashizzle,"&gt;I’m very hesitant because this sounds too good to be true


It is. Research comparable term life insurance. If you take the difference in the cost of the premiums, that is what you're supposedly ""investing."" You'll find that your actual rate of return on that money is substantially negative. The number they are quoting you're getting 6% interest on is almost certainly some significantly smaller subsection of that difference.


So what you end up doing is paying a premium equivalent to what you'd pay on a term policy, *plus* a huge markup on that, and *then* a small additional amount that you get the ""6%"" return on."
Frashizzle,"www.daveramsey.com


I'd suggest following this program.


The problem with bankruptcy is that the court will make you pay it anyway with that income. The point of bankruptcy is to have nothing left over; it's not like they'll just wash away your debts and you can keep saving money in the meantime.


Consult with a bankruptcy attorney, but I don't think a chapter 7 will actually do anything for you. The court will most likely just find that you can pay it anyway and make you pay it."
Frashizzle,"No problem - and it's one of those things where you need to take some time and think about what you want out of life. A pension is a good option if you want mostly-guaranteed income (if the company is still around) at retirement. But the question is whether it is important to *you* to have an actual asset (that you can pass down) that is producing your retirement income.


I chose the latter because I have things in my life, mostly charities, that I find fulfilling to know that I will be helping at death with a donation. If you don't have that (and I'm not saying that's a bad thing), then the pension might be the right option for you. "
Frashizzle,"On C, yeah, it's one of those little things you don't think about until you experience it. (Or at least I didn't think about it until I experienced it, lol). It's not to say that it makes the loan a *bad* decision per se, but you just have to factor that into your calculation. It's just something to consider - that you won't actually 'have' the title both physically and in the eyes of your state, and that if you need to sell it and have a handshake agreement right now, it will take you a month to have the transaction totally done (if you can find a buyer who is willing to be patient as you work it out)."
Frashizzle,"&gt;When does my 401k match ""end"" for the year? How much should &gt;I put towards it to assure I don't miss any of that 5%?

Never, matches are usually realtime and not pegged to a calendar.

&gt;With the ESPP, there is a maximum value I can receive of $25k per year. With the stock purchasing being every 6 months, how much should I put towards that to make sure I take advantage of it? Rough estimate seems like I'd need to put ~$20k towards it per year, or ~1770 a month. Am I missing something here? I also get refunded any extra that didn't go towards the stock if I hit the $25k limit. Probably not realistically feasible to save that much right now.


If I were faced with this offer, I probably wouldn't put anything beyond 5% in my 401k and just save all the money I can do to the stock purchases. When can you resell it? If you can just flip it same day, then that is literally just free money. However, if you **cannot** flip it, then I would be extremely careful about it and make it only a small part of your portfolio. You don't want to peg your income *and* your assets to the same company. If they have a bad year, you could lose everything, literally.


&gt;401k is pre-tax, is the ESPP also pre-tax?

I've never heard of one like this unless they are putting it into an IRA.


&gt;Best place to learn about healthcare things?


All plans are different. Read the guidelines of your individual plan.


&gt;Is there anything I should do with the pre-tax things like HSA? Or does that depend on if I get other health insurance or not?

Not really. At your age, there's no way to save too much in an HSA. It will follow you after this job, and there is a 100% chance you will use it in your lifetime regardless of your insurance.


Just as a side not, I don't know why you're keeping your student loans around. 5.5% isn't *that* much worse than an index fund would return. In other words, you'd be getting decent ROI by paying them off and you'd just get the burden off your back psychologically."
zghcu,"You're going to want to talk to your parents about opening them, as I'm sure you will need some sort of parental consent.  Figure out whether a Roth or Traditional IRA will work best for you, and pick a brokerage.  My personal favorite is Schwab, because they also have a checking account that has no foreign transaction fees or atm fees, which is really good for travelling.  You then make your initial deposit and monthly contributions, and watch your money grow."
zghcu,"Not sure if you could write it off as an employee expense, I would lean towards no, but I'm not positive.  As a business expense, yes you could write that kind of thing off.  Just make sure you do actual business in the office spaces.  

&amp;#x200B;

A side note:  Not sure how much a WeWork Membership is, but I know the Amex Business Platinum card offers a complimentary year.  AF is \~$600, but I believe that is cheaper than a year of WeWork.  Might be a good idea if you are just trying it out."
zghcu,"You can use any atm, anywhere in the world, and they don't charge you fees.  It is an excellent bank if you're an online banking kind of guy, and it comes with a brokerage account when you sign up for the checking account.  There's usually a $100 sign up bonus for opening an account with $1000 too."
zghcu,"I would get the experience if you can.  It will look good when applying to jobs in the future, and will show you are a good, driven student when applying to transfer.  Also, most internships are paid decently well in my experience."
zghcu,"You're going to want to get the most that the company will give you, which is 4%.  In order to get that full 4% match, you need to contribute 5% of your pay.  So essentially what will happen is you will have $4000 taken out of your pay each year and put into your 401k.  Your employer will contribute another $3200 for your match, and then $4800 for their profit sharing.  This way you will have $12000 contributed to your 401k each year, and $8000 of that is essentially free money contributed by your employer."
zghcu,"Yeah, I knew a lot of people like that when I was 17/18.  They became part of a pyramid scheme and they thought I was stupid for going to engineering school.  As of right now, engineering school is looking to be the better choice lol."
zghcu,"Go with Chapel Hill, and don't get into debt.  I'm $100k in debt, because I was faced with the same decision as you four years ago.  I went with the more expensive school, and while I have a really good job lined up (I went for mechanical engineering), I've got a ton of debt.  While I'm not going to have a hard time paying it back, it just sucks that I'm going to spend the first couple years out of college working to pay down my student loans as aggressively as possible."
zghcu,"Which insurance plan should I go with? I am going to be starting my first job out of college, and I need to pick a health insurance plan.  My mom and I have already determined that it's cheaper to go with one of the plans that my employer offers, but I'm not sure which plan I should go with.  

&amp;#x200B;

As a bit of background, I'm a 21 year old guy, and I'm pretty healthy overall.  However, I do like combat sports, and lifting, so I do get the occasional injury (what would have been a $30,000 knee surgery/reconstruction at 16, if I wasn't insured, for example).

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, Should I still go with the High Deductible plan, even though unexpected (but kinda expected) injuries come up every so often, and take advantage of the HSA, or should I go with the low deductible plan?  The high deductible plan would cost me $90/month, and the low deductible is $145/month.  Both are with Blue Cross Blue Shield, and both are eligible for a $25/month discount if I complete the wellness initiative each year (whatever that means)."
zghcu,"I don't believe that you can have tax advantaged accounts in Robinhood, which is where a good deal of my money goes.  I have my Roth IRA and 529s in Vanguard, and I like to keep everything in one place.  

I'm also not really a fan of Robin Hood.  To me they seem gimmicky, and I didn't really like that stunt that they pulled with the 3% checking/savings account thing a couple months ago.  On top of that, Vanguard isn't owned by investors, it's owned by it's shareholders, so therefore they are driven to make better choices for me, and not some billionaire investor."
zghcu,"Unfortunately, they don't cover repairs.  I would get a reduced mileage rate, since they are paying for me to have a new car.  I believe it's about $0.20/mile.  Since I am getting something fuel efficient though, there will be a good chunk of money from the mileage rate that isn't spent on fuel, and I was wondering how much of it I should allot for repairs.  That is an amazing warranty though, I didn't even know about that."
zghcu,"Personally, I wouldn't share it here.  What I mean when I say ""Build your resume"", is that you should do things that will look good to employers that you can put on your resume, like the the things that I mentioned.  It sounds like you've got a side hustle going on with the freelance photography.  Put that on your resume if its not on there already.  Having a side hustle or a business shows employers that you are a self starter, and that is typically indicative of a good employee."
zghcu,"It really depends on the interest rates.  Usually you don't want to consolidate Federal loans, because they come at cheap rates.  In my case, I am only consolidating my private loans, as they were all greater than 7%.  All my federal loans were under 5%."
zghcu,"There is a chance there may be language in the lease that would let her get out of it.  She would have to go over the lease agreement to find out.  If not, she should contact the party whom she signed the lease with and explain the situation.  People in general are pretty sensible.  Make sure she explains the whole situation though.  She should tell them that she fears for her life, and would like to be removed from the lease.  Her and the landlord have something in common, they don't want to be associated with people like Claire's husband."
zghcu,"I think that most people here on this sub use credit cards properly, but I don't think the majority of people as a whole use them properly, evidenced by the large amount of credit card debt the average American household has."
zghcu,"I would go with the Delta Card.  Delta is easy to use and a lot more versatile.  If you are flying to Mexico, they fly their own planes there too, not just partner airlines, so you should be able to find some availability.  Unless you plan on using the companion pass, you might just be better off with the Delta Gold (AF waived first year, after that $95).

zghcu,"I'm a big fan of Schwab.  Its really good, especially if you're a fan of online banking.  They don't have foreign transaction fees, and they reimburse all ATM fees (incurred from any ATM in the world) at the end of your statement.  It's great if you use ATMs or like to travel!"
zghcu,"I'll check them out.  I'm also going to take u/vettewiz advice, and check out some local insurance companies, and make sure I don't get shafted when it comes to insurance premiums.  If I get better quotes, that would definitely open up my car budget a lot more."
cowmandude,"&gt;Both of our families live in the capital of Norway, which has super expensive real estate. For 330k you'll get a 400-500 sqft. one-bed on the egde of the city or maybe 200-300 sqft. studio in the city center.

The truth is that this is all you can afford. Have you considered searching for employment elsewhere?"
cowmandude,"&gt;I have $47k in savings currently with Ally Bank.

Any reason you have 2.5 years of expenses in a savings account? You should make sure you're getting the full 401k match and then fill up your IRA. You should move you ""general investing"" stuff to the IRA as well. That tax advantage is no joke."
cowmandude,You might want to decide on whether or not you want to buy property before you make any moves. If you were planning on buying a 200k peice of property then my advise would change to having you just hold your cash for a down payment not do anything but move the general investment into your ira.
cowmandude,"The ""certain specific circumstances"" you read about would let you avoid the penalty for withdraw.

My suggestion is to look into taking a loan from your 401k instead of taking a withdraw. You pay yourself back over 6 months, and you even get to keep the interest you pay. If you default on the loan it's just looked at like you withdrew the money. It particularly makes sense in your situation where you might find employment and be able to repay the amount your borrowed. Make sense?"
cowmandude,"&gt;Is there a way to ask the fund manager or whoever whether or not the fund has actually earned me money in the long run? And whether that earning even accounts for the taxes I paid?

If you've gotten one every year then you've made money every year. They are subtracting their losses from their gains and that's the number that goes on your 1099. If you ever don't get one then you should get in touch and find out if you had losses you can write off.

&gt;I’m afraid that I’m going to need the money one day for a larger purchase and all I’m going to realize is a loss overall, especially considering the taxes I’ve paid on it.

You should be receiving fund performance paperwork or have some way of finding out how things are going. If not you might want to try and just cash out and then reinvest the money in a financial vehicle that you have control over.

"
cowmandude,"It probably wouldn't hurt to send them both an email first saying something like: ""The resolution of this problem in no way makes me whole. While my preference is to work with both of your organizations to find an amicable solution, if we are unable to work out a solution in the next 15 days I will be forced to explore civil and regulatory options to recover my damages."" Then if they don't fix it sue them both in small claims.

It's 3600 dollars and Google gets their merch back. Even if they show up to small claims and beat you, there's no way they end up better off financially than if they just refund you."
cowmandude,"&gt;Would offering 70% to 80% of the asking price be considered a slight and put the seller in a non-negotiable kinda mood?

What do you care? The house as currently priced is outside your price range. If offering 270 is a slight then you weren't going to get the house anyway."
cowmandude,"If I were you I would do it. You have WAY over enough money to survive for 6 months at your current life style. Unless you're in a highly volatile career field where that may be a common occurrence you're way better off saving for retirement now.

Oh and if you do decide to do it don't forget to fill this baby out for a free 550 dollars from Uncle Sam for being so fiscally responsible: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8880.pdf"
cowmandude,"Yea it looks like you're in the wonderful position of not having to choose between dollars and liquidity. Regardless of your goals you'll pretty much burn things down CC1, CC2, Mortgage(unless you are over the standard deduction with the interest), Car(maybe never pay it off at this interest rate...)"
cowmandude,"&gt;8736/30000 = 29.12% return on investment.

You're comparing yearly money to lump sum. If you included units on these numbers you'd see that it makes no sense.

Here's a better way to look at it. The pension is basically offering you a lifetime annuity. You can get a lifetime annuity at 65 with about a 5% monthly payout which means you would need about 175k to provide the same benefits in the free market. That's about the same as a 6% rate of return.

&gt;I am pretty confident, that taking out my pension to reinvest it into real estate is the wrong thing to do (since we'll have no money for a down payment where we move to and end up having to rent a place), but is there a way this could be feasible?

You're not taking into account the risk associated with owning and renting real estate or the cost of the labor/repairs you will have to put in. It could be feasible if you're a skilled handyman and can do most of the repairs yourself or if you have some other competitive advantage. Otherwise you're probably better off finding a REIT that focuses on residential holdings to make the same bet with better odds."
cowmandude,"You aren't taking into account the potential savings from the PMI and possibly an interest reduction on the mortgage. Say OP gets a 4.2% loan with no PMI, that saves him like 3k/yr in interest. The other debts total only cost like 1500 in interest."
cowmandude,"PMI is typically 1%, so getting rid of it will probably be a huge boon and none of your debt is high enough interest that it's an emergency to burn it down fast. I think your plan is the right one."
cowmandude,"Be careful to broach this topic nicely if the job is not replaceable. Sometimes when we're cheated we want to go in guns a blazing yelling about how we're going to contact the department of labor and blah blah blah. My guess is that a simple ""Hey I think you're calculating my overtime wrong. Here's a website that outlines it."" results in them fixing it in the future and possibly compensating you for past work. They may also just say you can't work overtime anymore.... Just be aware that there may be unintended consequences."
cowmandude,"If there's a match definitely take it. You'll end up ahead taking the match even if you withdraw with penalties.

The only other reason to contribute would be that you're already filling up an IRA and want more tax advantages space. At your income level that would be an incredible feat, but I figured it might be worth mentioning since tax advantaged money at your age is going to multiply 5-7x by the time you're retirement age."
cowmandude,"Think of it this way. You have a 600k capital gain, and the cost of living in the bay area has doubled. These are two separate facts. Don't convulute things. Do you want to keep living there? Does your new found windfall make you want to leave?"
cowmandude,Why would you trade one house for another? All your doing is playing an accounting game with your wealth and letting a realestate broker have a price of it. The end result is that you own a house in the bay area just like you do now.
cowmandude,"&gt; Is it possible that the taxes I have paid on capital gain distributions over the life of the fund will exceed whatever “profit” I may have made if I sold the entire fund today?

No, because you only pay taxes on the gains and those taxes are always less than the ACTUAL gains. If you take losses you will get tax writeoffs that should cancel out the impact of those gains. As an example say you have 10k and made 1k profit, generating a 250 dollar tax bill. You now have 11,000 in the account and you've paid 250 in taxes. Then lets say next year you lose 2k. You get to write off 2k of your income which should be about a 500$ tax benefit leaving you with 9k in the account and 250$ net tax benefit.

&gt; I have been getting a 1099 each year, but I guess I’m not sure if I can tell the unrealized gains or losses (if those are the right terms)— meaning profit or loss?

You only paid taxes on realized profits and losses."
cowmandude,"&gt;Is there value in keeping these ""funds"" all in separate high-yield savings accounts? Or should I just put them all in the same account?

The only value is in making it more obvious for you when you're breaking your plan. There's no financial value.

&gt;But should I consider investing either of the other two in stocks or T-bills or something?

Can you afford to lose the money? Are you willing to skip a vacation because the stock market took a dive?"
cowmandude,"&gt;if you know a downturn is coming, just go 100% bonds. Then go 100% stocks when you expect it to go up.

Psh you can do better than that. Get yourself some options and really leverage the hell out of your money. If you knew the S&amp;P would be 2200 on Jun 21st, you can buy 2500$ puts for 8.70 and make 300$ per share of SPX. Op should have 4-5 million in the bank by July."
cowmandude,"Paying off debts with higher interest rates will save you the most money long term. Paying off debts with the lowest balance will get you liquidity sooner and tends to be psychologically easier for people to handle. You should do one or the other, which in this case might mean moving the 35$ to CC1."
cowmandude,"It's disappointing but ultimately it's their job to resolve their issues. It's not your fault. At least they were honest and acted quickly to rectify their mistake.

What they're doing is incredibly unprofessional and I would probably continue searching for a job even after they ""unhold"" their offer. You can't put an offer on hold after it's been accepted. Changing the start date substantially changes the terms of the agreement, especially to an undetermined date or possibly never."
anthonyjh21,"Maybe this is dependent on your utility provider but I do get a credit, albeit at a lower rate than what I'd pay. 


Directly from PG&amp;E: 

WILL I RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR EXCESS ENERGY GENERATED BY MY SYSTEM?

At True-Up, you may be entitled to compensation for surplus energy—if your system produced more energy than your home used over the 12-month billing cycle. The rate is set by California Public Utilities Commission at approximately two to four cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). As a Private rooftop solar customer, you do not need to take any action to receive compensation. PG&amp;E will determine your eligibility automatically at the end of each True-Up billing cycle and calculate any amount owed to you on the True-Up Statement.

EDIT: 

It's based on California Assembly Bill 920. 

Also: 

HOW IS COMPENSATION PAID?

If the amount you owe is less than zero on your True-up statement, you have two compensation payment choices. Your first choice is to save compensation as a credit to apply toward future energy charges. The second choice is to request a check if the amount is over $1.

For what it's worth I had talked about this with a PG&amp;E solar Customer service rep a few weeks ago who confirmed the above. 

EDIT2: 
I think I'm just not understanding. I haven't had my coffee today. I think you're referring to leasing which would I'm guessing would only give you enough to offset and not overproduce, whereas with financing or cash purchase you'd be able to future proof with 100%+ ?


"
anthonyjh21,"Yeah even without the 30% credit the payoff point (breakeven point) is only pushed out an additional 3 years to 9 total, giving me 16 years of warranty on the system and installation. Because of no initial cost and the fact that I'm not paying more per month than I was without solar ($196 to $197) it's not impacting my budget at any point of the 25 years. I'd personally still pull the trigger without the subsidy. "
anthonyjh21,"VTSAX is a mutual fund, VTI for the index version, which captures the entire stock market. Buying it will give the average return of the market and because of its self-cleansing nature you'll reduce risk since you're not tied into just one sector or company. It's the best you'll get if you're young, weary of risks but still want a high return. Your alternative is to park it in low return options like a savings account or Bond but then again you'll do little better than beat inflation. "
anthonyjh21,"Take a deep breath. It's really not as complicated as you think it is. Look up a book called The Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins. He wrote it as a guide for his daughter, which grew into a book. He talks about the market as if it's a mug of beer with foam on it. The title says it all. Audio is available if you've got a short attention span like I do. 

As far as the portfolio, can't really even begin to answer anything without knowing your age and goals. From a glance though the fees aren't bad and it's weighted aggressively towards stocks which can be good since I assume you're young. Target date funds, which is what you have, aren't a bad place to start or even stay if the numbers work. Just keep in mind that oftentimes they'll rebalance to being overly conservative as you get closer to that 2055 target date, which again depends on your goals and risk tolerance as well. "
anthonyjh21,"Northern California. Between SF and Sacramento (Fairfield). We can get up to 100 in the summer but it's not nearly as common as more inland. I'm not concerned with the panels breaking, but even if they do I'm at peace in knowing they're covered under warranty. The biggest challenge around here is wind, which over the years could pose an issue with being secured. Time will tell though. "
anthonyjh21,"This hits home. Like OP I had to claw my way through school, also going through the ringer to eventually be granted financial independence. It took a while though and in the meantime life goes on and bills expect to be paid. 

One summer I literally took every side job I could from the job board. I remember going to bed early on a Friday night (which can feel weird with roommates) just so I could wake up at 5am and pull weeds for some old lady for basically minimum wage. It was going to be like 105 that day so I had to do outside work earlier in the day so I wouldn't pass out from my other jobs. I had so many shit jobs with shit pay that many other students passed on, but in my mind if I had the time then it was an opportunity to build enough to get through the following semester. 

I don't have fond memories of that summer, like at all, but I'm also proud of it. Sometimes in life when it's ***really*** hard you have to just accept it and try not to feel like a victim in all of this, because it can rob you of your sense of empowerment and intentionality. You may not be the cause of your circumstances but you are responsible for it. Only question is how will you respond? "
anthonyjh21,"You can't judge what you aren't tracking. You need to track what you spend, create a budget, monitor and adjust it consistently. Depending on your circumstances you can carve out weekly or monthly fun money. Let it roll over if you want to save for something big. 

Bottom line though is you need to treat your personal finances as if you are your own corporation. If you're tracking what comes in and out, have a plan, mission statement (what are your goals) and constantly reevaluate and adjust then you'll be much more likely to succeed. Doesn't mean you can't pay yourself. If anything just like I tell my wife creating a budget can allow you to treat yourself while simultaneously not feeling any guilt. "
anthonyjh21,"Same reason my neighbors did, they hear ""free"" or ""no money down"" and take the bait. 

Financed our system two months ago to offset 126% (NEM) and at a monthly cost that's lower than our average utility bill. Payoff point is 6 years and comes with a 25 year comprehensive warranty. You bet your ass I number crunched, emailed and worked my way to the best possible deal. 

Long story short, solar can be an amazing investment, in our case most likely cash flowing from day 1, no doubt in large part to the 30% tax credit which you don't get when you lease. 

OP do you have NEM with a true up bill that can potentially lead to the service provider paying you for any net generation? Even so, I can't think of a scenario where this won't bite you in the ass. 

"
anthonyjh21,"There's so many that it's not really worth stressing about. The most common is FICO 8 which I believe Amex uses. I personally have a free Experian account that allows me to see real time information (including FICO 8) and get reminders of any account or score change. 

"
MegaSpuds,"Lol. Sounds like you’re making great life choices. Get rid of the debt first.  Just get after it, snowball it, or whatever the total money make over suggests.  I want to feel bad, but I have own $60K in student loans — but I’m just a poor slump enlisted troop in the Air Force, so I’ll likely have those loans forever. And before anyone tells me about the student loan forgiveness program, it’s a sham.  I was paying 3 years on the program and the entire time I didn’t make a single qualifying payment.  Also. They don’t tell you at the end of it, they write off the debt in a lump sum so be ready to pay taxes in that as an earned income credit.   Banana.  "
MegaSpuds,"Do the math on how long you’ll take to
Pay off the credit card and how much interest you’ll pay. If it’s more then the $$ you’d pay for insurance.  Then do that.  But also, As luck would have it you’ll probably pay the bike off lower your insurance and then total it. And then be, F’d. So you know. You do you boo. But follow the math. "
MegaSpuds,"I thought so.  It’s pretty basic but rent cost stuck out as A disproportionate outlay.  Just saying,  You should only spend about 30% of your fixed income on housing.   Meaning if you want to outlay $2000 for rent or a mortgage you have to be bringing in at least 6500 after taxes. So yeah,  helpful indeed!  She/he is spending or is going to spend way to much on rent.  From the numbers aim for $1,350 on rent. Maybe $1500 at the MOST."
thisonexounts,I drive 75 minutes each way to work.  I’ve been doing it for many years.  You can do it for a summer just fine.  Save up as much money as you can do you can buy something after you graduate.  Be sure to do something nice for your parents for giving you this opportunity to get ahead financially in life.  Cook them dinner or treat them out to their favorite restaurant once in awhile.  Also; open a Roth IRA and start maxing the guy out.  Your future self will thank yourself later.
thisonexounts,"You’re doing great on expenses right now.  Don’t focus too much on the what if’s now.  Right now is a good time to focus on what you want to do for a career.

From your posts it looks like you don’t have/want to go to college.  Have you thought about trade school?  I’ve heard Plumbers, Electricians, hvac workers, CDL (truck) Drivers all make good money and don’t require insane amounts of debt to get into.

You can also go IT route if you like computers.  You don’t need a degree to get a help desk job and experience is worth more than a degree or certifications.  IT can progress to 6 figures and beyond depending on what specialty you want to learn about.  "
thisonexounts,"1.  The important thing is to be saving for retirement.  So congratulations on that.  Whether you do Roth or traditional is not as important as deciding to save.  


2.  The advice I usually hear is that 22% or less tax bracket you should be Roth.  At the 24% bracket you can make the case to do either, but since you’ll have a taxable pension as well as social security you’d probably still be best with Roth.  If taxes go up by the time you retire; this also makes roth better.  Once you pass the 24% or near the end of your working career then traditional might be the best.


3.  Know that the difference in making the “wrong” choice between Roth and traditional will only be effectively a few small percent difference in your wealth when you retire.  So do not stress too much about this choice.  Just pick one.  You can always change between the two as you learn more about finances and your situation changes.  Having a mix of both traditional and Roth allows you to have more options on how to strategically withdraw your money in retirement years anyway."
thisonexounts,"I Guess the only real advice I can give you is learn from this.  If you lend money to someone, expect that you won’t get it back.  And those that do pay you back are probably friends you should keep around.  

I’ve loaned money to friends and family members.  I’ve only been paid back once.  I lent this money only if I could spare it and in my mind thought of it as a gift.  If I get paid back great, if not oh well.  I also never give a second loan unless the first one is paid.  

Learn that it is okay to tell people “No.”

You can take this to the sub reddit for relationships and see what advice you get there."
thisonexounts,"The $700 more was an overpayment by his company.  I think the company can work with him to have some money taken out to recover the $700.  One time I knew someone that got overpaid a few thousand over the course of a year (honest mistake for both parties).  payroll caught it removed a little bit from future pay checks until it was paid back.

As for stopping, yes.  If your dad chooses to cut off his Brother he can.  He can try explaining that he can’t support both families by himself and needs to put his children and Wife first.  Your uncle will have a hard time adjusting to this as he hasn’t had to fend for himself based on the info you have given.  If your Father wants to make him pay his fair share for utilities then he needs to outline consequences.  Example.  If you don’t pay, I will have to evict you.  Sounds harsh, but if there is no consequence then there is no reason for your Uncle and his kid to change.

Also try not to worry about the $25k.  It isn’t your money; so you don’t need to worry about it.  Your dad chose to help out a family member.  He continued to give his Brother money knowing that he was most likely never going to see that money again.  "
thisonexounts,"Your job now is school.  Do well in school.  Figure out what interests you and learn more about it.  Get involved in extracurricular activities.  You will become an adult and be working most of your life; enjoy your teens while you can.

At your age a car seems like a huge deal; but you will have friends and a brother that can drive you around. 

Think about what type of career you want to have.  Talk to your school’s guidance Counselors about it.  If there is a job or apprenticeship that can help you build skills for that career, then sure take it.  

Edit:  And Happy Birthday!"

What he did may be unethical, but earlier you said he was the one that told your Father about it (after he spent it); so at least he came clean."

alexm2816,If there isn't a match you're better off prioritizing your IRA contributions because you'll have more flexibility and likely lower fees.  After you've maxed that there is still a tax advantage to contributing to a 401k vs a traditional brokerage account if you are able to.
alexm2816,"Most states will not allow registration to a PO box for exactly the reason you're outlining.  

States want the compensation related to vehicle registration/drivers license fees/vehicle taxes and insurance companies want the true risk (and cost) of insuring a vehicle reflected accurately so insuring in a location you don't live is likely to violate the terms of your insurance.  

Every state's 'residency' requirement for when a vehicle and your license must be obtained in that state will be different and you'll need to look at those laws and compare to the way you'll be travelling."
alexm2816,"Why on earth would you leave a job that you have for one that 'might', after you 'work your ass off', STILL pay less than what you're earning now?

That said, giving up nearly $100k a year now and the career arc that you're likely going to set back if not give up is a HUGE setback.

I don't put large amounts on this card but I do use it almost every month (almost always less than $100), and I pay the balance in full each month. I get 1% in cash back, and I'm thinking about finding another card that gives 2% back.

What happens to my score, if anything, if I sign up for another card and just straight up stop using the Discover card? Should I cancel the Discover when I do that? Does it not matter?

So is the general recommendation to someone not to be a guarantor? It sounds like this essentially boils down to how confident I am that my brother will make his payments. If he does, then me signing as a guarantor allows him to get his apartment, that's the benefit. The risk is being held liable for the rent.

My follow up question would be this, how long would I be held responsible for? In other words, if he signs a 1 year lease, then when that year is up, am I off the hook? If he signs on for another year after that, would I have to resign as a guarantor (if the landlord still requests that, that is)?"

I still have a local bank that my checking is located in, for receiving paychecks and making payments out of, and I set the accounts up to be able to receive and give transfers so every so often I transfer money into my e-fund.

Unfortunately, the draw back to the online bank is the difficulty of depositing/withdrawing money (I like doing that at a physical bank), but the extra interest imo is worth it. I keep the checking open with a little cash in it in case some catastrophic thing happened that required me to have money TODAY, I can just stroll to the bank to get it."
KingJames5393,"Guarantor for Apartment Hello all,

My brother possibly will need a guarantor for an apartment he's looking to get. I know nothing about being a guarantor and was looking for advice as to whether or not this is a risky thing to do. I trust that he will make his rent payments, but are there any risks associated with this besides being potentially responsible for his rent? Are there any benefits?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  

Actually, rather than make a new comment I'll edit the op, a few comments are saying the same thing, so I'll post a new comment rather than reply.

So is the general recommendation to someone not to be a guarantor? It sounds like this essentially boils down to how confident I am that my brother will make his payments. If he does, then me signing as a guarantor allows him to get his apartment, that's the benefit. The risk is being held liable for the rent.

My follow up question would be this, how long would I be held responsible for? In other words, if he signs a 1 year lease, then when that year is up, am I off the hook? If he signs on for another year after that, would I have to resign as a guarantor (if the landlord still requests that, that is)?"

Sip_py,"Naturally your expenses will change over time. But most people need 70-90% of their pre retirement income to maintain the same lifestyle in retirement. However you might have new expenses if you have lifestyle changes. 

Grab your current budget and work through what will be there and what won't. 25 years left on your mortgage, that's an expense you won't have in retirement. Planning on having a winter home? That's a new expense. If you want to travel, pay attention to how much a trips total cost are, and multiply that by the number or trips you want per year."
Sip_py,"I work in the employer retirement plan space. It's per employee regardless of filing status. There's nothing to report because 401k contributions directly reduce your W-2 income - so it's the limit per person regardless if you're filing jointly, single, head of household.

Sip_py,"Sounds like your going through a contract conversation. If you're in Traditional, I'd keep it in the old plan. But if you're using other funds, pay attention to the expense ratios, a lot of the older plans have really high ones and newer plans have open architecture. 

You can leave traditional in the old plan and move other monies to the new one.

Additional reasons for keeping it in the old traditional is the payout rate. If you annuitize, the longer you're in Traditional, the higher the payout rate."
Sip_py,"I mean, pure brokers have been pretty useless for a long time. Edward Jones charges 2.5% for a stock trade - $250 on a $10,000 stock purchase... Meanwhile you can go to Schwab or whoever and buy the same stock for $4.95.

Sip_py,"Keep maxing out your Roth! You're in the lowest tax bracket you'll ever be in and you'll likely prefer the deduction once you're out of residency (although most large medical networks offer Roth K's which don't have income limits)

I don't know about rhe REPAYE plan, but just because you have a $0 payment doesn't mean your loan isn't accruing interest. So you may want to start paying it even though your minimum payment is $0

Do you have disability insurance? If not, get it. 

And keep building your emergency fund. 5k is a great start, but you probably want closer to 15k

"
Sip_py,"This is literally how I present it to clients everyday. In a black and white world, you're likely to have a lower bracket in retirement and traditional is the way to go. But it's not a black and white world, we don't know future tax rates, and having tax diversification is a nice tool in your toolbox.

Ideally you use Roth options early on in life when your taxes are lowest (for most people) and they have the most time to grow. As you age and progress through a career, the tax deduction becomes more attractive."
Sip_py,"An advisor friend used to work for MS. He said he was ""working in the big leagues"". I respected him less after that.

In all seriousness, major firms come down to the individual advisor. No one is reinventing the wheel and if you need an advisor, you want someone you can trust and that is competent. 

On a different note. I wouldn't touch CDs right now. Interest rates are so mushy id just throw money into a Marcus savings account and wait till we have a better understanding of long term rates."
Redsnork,"You could potentially use a CC to pay off something like a car loan using a service like Plastiq, but services like that typically charge around 2-3% fees.

I'd do your own research if you choose to go this route, and decide if the fees are worth it for the points."
Redsnork,"Oh definitely.

I see the appeal of the 15 year mortgage, especially in light of OP's retirement goals, but I'd be willing to bet that the best returns would come from managing the property individually until retirement age. After retirement, OP could outsource management to a separate company and enjoy ""true"" retirement while maximizing the tax benefits (property management fees are also deductible).

Then again, a lot of the landlords I've known are functionally ""retired"" and make property management their full time job, which also has the potential for more tax breaks."
Redsnork,"First step: read the [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics).

After that, set aside 3-6 months worth of expenses in a high-yield savings account for emergencies. From there, you can contribute to a Roth IRA or a 401k (if your job has IRA matching, consider funding up to the maximum match).

Of course, depending on the interest rate of your student loans, it may be a good idea to aggressively pay those down first. The best return on your money will always come from paying off high-interest debt."
Redsnork,"I'm not sure of what your specific situation is, or why you're thinking of moving out immediately at 18, but there are a few other communities that may help with other things you may be going through:

Redsnork,"You keep on saying ""a company"" or ""the company.""
Was it the credit card company? A consumer goods company? You're going to have to be a bit more specific.

In general though, if your credit card is cancelled and you've already reported the fraud, the credit card issuer is likely already watching the card activity and you will not be liable for any fraudulent purchases."
Redsnork,"Keep in mind, you’re posting in a financial subreddit. The majority of the responses you are going to get will be in favor of a higher salary and a perceived “safer” future.

Will you come out better financially if you take the helo pilot training? Most likely.

Will you be happier with more money, putting a hold on your dream location and field? Only you can answer that.

Ultimately, it’s your decision. It looks like you’ve already done your research. Going purely by numbers, it’s an easy call to make. Going by your own happiness, that’s another call entirely."
Redsnork,"You're already maxing out your Roth, which is a **great** start.

The only other tax-advantaged account you may have access to is an HSA. If you have the ability to contribute to an HSA, you may want to; check out [this article](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/091615/how-use-your-hsa-retirement.asp) for more info on HSAs and retirement.

Besides an HSA, I'd look into taxable brokerages. Of course, as with all investments, you should diversify and do your own research first. You have the right instincts with ETFs and Index Funds (built-in diversification, woo!), but I would look at a few of them and divide your money between a few. 

Because you are young, you can afford to be aggressive in your investments and ride through any lows in the market. Don't sweat any short term dips, you'll be fine.

Also, /r/investing is a great community that would welcome a question like this and would likely give you some more detailed advice."
Redsnork,"Got it.

To echo u/Liquidretro's post, making a budget either on paper, or through YNAB or Mint is a good next step after consolidating your debt (at a lower interest rate of course). See how much money you can realistically put toward the debt each month, cutting unnecessary expenses if possible. Make your debt repayment your primary financial goal.

Moving forward, I would follow the [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) on the sidebar and check out the wiki for more guidance, the [debt](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt) page may be particularly relevant to you."
Redsnork,"r/Ebay or r/Flipping may have some better insight on this.

Are you selling personal property, or flipping? If you are selling your personal property, you shouldn't need to file. However, if you're flipping, that is a business, and should be taxed as such.

Another thing to consider is your selling volume; you said that you've only sold about $1k worth of goods on ebay. With that in mind, you may not even need to file. I would check [this article](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/claim-ebay-sales-taxes-59661.html) out for more information.

In my experience though, if you're a one-person LLC or a sole proprietorship, your EIN/TIN is just your personal social security number."
Redsnork,"Tracking your expenses is the first step. From there, you can get a picture of where your money is going, if you are spending too much in a certain category, and how much you can put away every month.

Mint or YNAB are great places to start tracking expenses and making budget plans.

However, I am curious about your rent situation. If you are living with your parents, it would be nice to offer them some money to go towards utilities or the expenses of owning a house. If you are making $50k a year and have no debts, you can certainly afford to do so.

Also, given the fact that your college AND truck are paid off and you are still asking questions about allocating money implies that your parents helped you out quite a bit with both. When you make your budget, I would budget a certain amount every month to give to your parents."
Redsnork,"That sounds like a conversation you should have with your parents. If they're maxing out retirement accounts now and have solid long-term plans, they may not even need your help later on down the line.

Assuming you have good, supportive parents; the best gift to them will be to see you succeed and make smart decisions. It sounds like you are currently doing that.

Money wise, you could either pay rent to your parents, or you could set aside the money you *would* pay on rent (plus a little extra) in a savings account, retirement account, or other investment account (depending on your situation/goals). It will get you used to budgeting with a significant chunk taken out of your salary, and will set you up for a solid financial future.

All that aside; this may sound corny, but make sure and take any and all opportunities to make your parents feel appreciated. I was in a similar position to you; and while I didn't pay my dad directly, I made sure to take time to talk to him, visit him whenever possible, and treat him occasionally for helping me out so much when I was getting started. The time I've spent with him is worth more than any paycheck I will ever earn.

You can always work harder and make more money, but you can't make more time with your family. Treasure them."
Redsnork,"First, check out the [wiki page on windfalls.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall)

You haven't given us much info on your situation, including interest rates on your car loans or mortgage so I can't get too specific. However, as a general rule the best returns come from paying off your highest interest rate debt (probably the car loans in your situation). Otherwise, look into investing either in a post-tax brokerage, or look into backdoor Roth options to put away some extra money for retirement."
Redsnork,"With some exceptions, most banks don't have insurance for Safe Deposit Boxes. FDIC insurance only covers your actual bank balance up to $250k typically, but no such insurance typically exists for SDBs.

IMO, get a safe. Depending on your living situation and your insurance policy, it may be covered by homeowner's or renter's insurance if anything gets stolen. Of course, you should check with your local bank and read your insurance policy before you make any decisions."
Redsnork,"Honestly, it depends.

My father travels quite a bit for work, and uses Chase Ultimate Rewards points to book travel. Depending on the airline partners that he transfers the points to and when he chooses to fly, he can get up to 11 cents per point of value (international first class tickets are some of the best point redemptions around). Ultimately, its a significant ROI in terms of paying a little extra to earn some points. Throw some signup bonuses into the mix, as well as yearly spend bonuses, and the point returns can be well worth it if you calculate your point returns well and plan ahead.

Of course, for the majority of people, this is not the case and your mileage may vary (no pun intended). It all depends on how you choose to use your points."
Redsnork,"If OP’s parents made a promise and offered to help them with the bill and they lied; then that’s another situation entirely.

From what it sounds like, OP asked for help, the parents promised help, and it never came. Hell, it looks like OP even asked if they should pay right away and the parents /offered/ help. If I had a parent that worked in a health network, I would certainly want to at least talk to them before paying for significant medical expenses.

OP isn’t arguing that they shouldn’t pay the debt, or that they aren’t responsible for the debt; they are asking what to do to recover from the consequences of their parents’ broken promise."
Redsnork,"Yes, you can have her cosign on a loan, but that's generally a bad idea. (Yes, even if you're getting married soon.)

More expensive doesn't always mean more reliable. My first car was a 1999 Toyota Camry that I drove until the floorboards fell out. The only reason I sold it is because I came across a slightly newer Honda Civic that I could own outright with no loan.

Head on over to /r/whatcarshouldIbuy and do some research. Build your credit, and you'll come out better in the long run."
Redsnork,"Check her physical mail and email for any evidence of open bank accounts or debts.

When she dies, obtain multiple copies of her death certificate. You'll need them to settle any debts, gain access to any of her accounts, and do all of the legal ""end of life"" things.

Of course, make sure her will and trust is together as well.

Emotionally, when she passes, take as long as you need and do NOTHING. Grieving people tend to make rash decisions (in my experience) and the best thing you can do for yourself is to simply take it easy.

Also, if/when you go through your own grieving process, don't let anyone dictate how you should feel or grieve. Everyone grieves in different ways, and there is no one that has the authority to tell you how to feel when a parent dies. As long as you aren't doing anything to hurt yourself or your family, there is no wrong way to grieve. Even if that means not grieving at all, feeling relief, or choosing to remain positive.

I've been there; hope you make it through okay."
Redsnork,"This is good advice generally, but I'd advise against the 15 year mortgages, ESPECIALLY for investment properties. For real estate investors, you can deduct mortgage interest from your taxes against your rental income. This alone could save you hundreds of thousands in taxes in the long run. If you're worried about managing properties, you can hire a property manager to field maintenance requests (they typically take about 8-10% of gross rent as payment). Given the fact that you likely don't have much tax-deferred money set aside already, it's likely in your best interest to deduct as much as possible. Of course, every market is different, and you should do your own research.

In terms of networking with Real Estate Investors, its definitely a GREAT idea. Many REIs I know would love to have a good relationship with an electrician. It could likely lead to good, steady work."
Redsnork,"Depending on your credit score, you may be eligible for some credit card signup bonuses that net you a bunch of airline miles if you meet a minimum spend. I'd look into Southwest personally, as their flights to Hawaii are the cheapest in the game now. Look into /r/churning or /r/awardtravel for more strategies on that front.

For hotels, don't bother with third party booking sites like Priceline or Expedia. In my experience, calling the hotel directly will give you the best rates. Booking sites take a percentage of the money, so its advantageous to everyone involved to cut out the middleman.

Also, when you're in Hawaii, don't be afraid to cook your own food while on vacation. I've seen people rack up restaurant bills that almost rival their initial airfare. Of course, you'll want to try out some of the local cuisine (and you should!) but I wouldn't recommend eating out for every meal."
Redsnork,"&gt; I asked my parents what happened and they gave me the verbal version of the shrug emoji.

Do not accept this. You put your trust in them and they failed you. It either sounds like they are either not grasping how badly their mistake is hurting you, or they simply do not care.

Going forward, try and get some information from the collections agencies about your account, as it sounds like your parents are not willing to volunteer any information. [The wiki has some great advice on this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections) Did they pay any part of the debt? Did they ignore the bill? This is important stuff to know.

Essentially, it looks like you are going to have to pay this debt without any help.

The good news is that it is possible for collections accounts to be removed from your report, and it is still possible to repair your credit. Also, medical collections accounts tend to be a bit easier to deal with. Start with the wiki, and don’t underestimate the power of a goodwill letter to get a collection report off of your account.

All the financials aside, I would really take some time to evaluate your relationship with your parents. They broke a promise to you, are putting you in a difficult position, and they don’t seem to care.

Best of luck with this, and I hope you come out alright."
Redsnork,"Well, as I said, r/Investing is a good community for questions and research on that front.

As for ETFs, some track different industries and have different portfolios. For example VOO is Vanguard's S&amp;P 500 index fund (US based) while VT is Vanguard's total world stock ETF. Some ETFs get even more specific, following industries like natural gas, tech, or utilities.

For more specific guidance, look at some target retirement date funds (many brokerages have them) for dates close to when you'd like to retire. You can either mirror these investments, or actually invest into these funds. Many of them have low expense ratios and are managed to have appropriate levels of risk depending on your timeline. Here's an [article from Vanguard](https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/ekit/pmed/trf/index.html?ajdejc&amp;abqu&amp;&amp;) that goes more into the specifics.

As for taxes, that all depends. Some ETFs pay dividends, which are taxed. These dividends will either come in the form of checks, or will be credited to your brokerage account (some brokerages even allow you to reinvest dividends automatically). However, for the actual ETF shares, you don't pay any taxes until you sell the shares (like a stock). If you sell the shares after owning them for less than a year, your gains are taxed at a high rate (short term capital gains), however, if you hold on to them for a while, your gains are taxed at a much lower rate (long term capital gains). 

To be clear, you pay taxes on the GAINS, not the overall value of the stock. For example: If you buy a share of an ETF at $10, then sell it off later for $40, the gain of $30 is taxed, not the overall value of the share at $40. Of course, most brokerages will automatically prepare you a 1099 around tax time with all of your sales and dividends accounted for, so you shouldn't have to worry about the nitty-gritty."
Redsnork,"If you have 0% interest on your CC (I assume its some kind of promo deal) then there's no rush to pay it off. That being said, it is absolutely, 100% necessary that you pay it off before the promo ends. For most promo deals, if you reach the end of the deal and haven't paid off your balance, a high interest rate is retroactively applied to your previous balance and suddenly you're left with a nasty surprise of a high balance and a ludicrous interest rate.

I would put aside the money that you'd need to pay off the CC debt and either put into a high-yield savings account or a CD that expires about a month before your promo rate ends. At that point, you can pay off the CC and pocket the interest that you earned."
Redsnork,"Thanks for the edit!

My original point still stands; if the card has been reported as compromised and is closed, you shouldn't be liable for any fraudulent charges.

Depending on how the card details were acquired, the scammers may have your name and phone number, but that info is surprisingly easy to find on the internet, and I wouldn't worry about them having it. When they find out the card is dead, they'll likely move on to the next scam and won't try anything again. Most scammers know that banks watch accounts like hawks when there's reported fraud, so they'd have to be dumb to try anything again."

First bill came due and I paid it almost all the way off (thanks to a paypal snafu, but that's a different thread). 

Just got an alert that my Experian score just hit at 300, which I understand to be the absolute bottom.

Is this normal? It happened literally the day I made my on-time payment. Will it go up each time I make a payment, or what should I look for?

I have two hard pulls, one credit card with a $300 limit, and that's it.

SpaceForceAwakens,"Weird question about managing a friend's credit while he's in prison. I know, I know. I have a friend who did something bad while having a reaction to prescription drugs. He's made a deal with the DA to do a few years. (How long exactly will be determined in a few weeks at sentencing.)

He's young, only 22, but will be about 28-31 when he gets out.

He's never used his credit for anything. I've been doing some research, and found that lots of inmates find that they have nil credit when they're released, things having ""fallen"" off of their reports.

So after talking it over with his father and him, we'd like to be a little more proactive, so that once he's out he'll have the credit he'll need to get an apartment or get a car or what-have-you.

The plan is for him to grant his dad Power of Attorney over his finances. Then open one or two secured credit cards. Over the course of his time down, his dad will make a few small purchases with the cards to send him things he'll need and then pay them back in full.

The question is, where can we go from there? He won't have much earning power in there, so his total available credit will be low, but his other factors should be OK. He'll have a couple of older accounts open and in good standing, likely no derogatory marks, and an excellent payment history.

This all seems like a good idea in theory, rather like how some parents open credit accounts in their kids' names so that they've got good credit when they turn 18.

But sometimes good ideas can be disastrous. Are we being naive here? Is there something glaringly obvious we're missing? Is this even a good idea?

Any help is, of course, appreciated!"
SpaceForceAwakens,"I know how secured cards work, thanks.

And no, they’re not top-tier cards. They’re very simple, Credit One as an example. There are sites that report what range of score they tend to approve, and in square in the middle of that range, and this my confusion."
SpaceForceAwakens,"His dad is a pretty stable guy and makes enough of his own money, so we're not worried about having his scored wrecked. We're more worried about any kind of things that might pop up while keeping his scores above water."
SpaceForceAwakens,"Do banks check your account activity when weighing credit card approvals? I have a checking account at my local credit union. They're a great place to bank, but I don't use it much. I'm a freelancer, and most of my clients pay through PayPal or CashApp, and I have a couple of online-only banks that I really like, so most of my money is in there. I generally use the credit union for when I get cash or old-fashioned paper checks.

Right now, though, the credit union is offering a really great card that I appear to be well-qualified for. But I rarely have more than about $150 in my account at one time.

So my question is this: When I apply, are they going to look at my balance activity? Or do they process it with the same information used as, say, Captial One? Should I not apply if I don't use the credit union much?

Any advice here would be great. And you people rock."
SpaceForceAwakens,"New item in collections for unreturned RCN cable equipment, but the equipment was returned? Hello, you gorgeous people.

So I got an alert a few days ago from TransUnion that there was a new item negative on my credit. I check it out and it's a charge for almost $800 from RCN, an east coast cable company, from when I lived there a few years back.

It's for the unreturned cable box-and-DVR-combo. The time is right, but here's the thing: I returned the box. It was one of the last things I did before I moved.

So I called up RCN and they say that this happens sometimes, that the check-ins often don't get updated in the inventories at the warehouse, etc., and that he'd look into it and call me back.

So he does, and we talk, and there's no record of it being returned, but he'll put in a trouble ticket, as soon as I give him my account information -- which doesn't work, since I don't have an account, since I moved and returned the cable box.

I want to contest this, but I can't prove that I returned it -- I lost most of my paperwork in a move when a bag was stolen. I'm thinking about calling the store itself, but will that get me anywhere? Has anyone tried that before?

My credit is new, and I'm doing a good job building it up, and this as put a great big kabosh on my near-term plans of finding a better apartment and buying a car.

But when I try to get a couple of cards that apps like Credit Karma say I'm pre-qualified for, the pre-qualification apps deny me, citing a low or non-existent score. A little digging told me that most cards still use FICO instead of Vantage, and now I'm all confused.

shoshy566,It really depends on your location. If I were you though I’d try to get a cheaper phone contract. You can find good ones for $35-40 a month and that would give you a good chunk of change to reallocate later on.
shoshy566,"My dad cosigned my loans but the amount that went to me for expenses from that loan was $3k housing and $4k other living expenses. Even if I just count rent from my apartment for the 9 month lease I had it was more than those expenses without including utilities. 

Do I need to provide proof as to what the loans paid for? A large percentage of that went towards tuition which I don't believe is counted towards this (but please correct me if I'm wrong)."
shoshy566,"I mean by the sound of it, it already has caught up with him. He doesn't have any equity in his home and his credit is most likely trash because of his bankruptcy declaration. The real kicker though is that if he continues like this he won't ever be able to put away enough to retire."
shoshy566,"Sorry, I forgot to post. My college is in NY, my internship in VA, and my parents live in CT (which is what I use as my permanent address for mail but that's just about it). For my internship I had my CT address listed incorrectly for the first week before I switched it to my VA address but I got my W-2 form for both CT and VA so I don't know what to make of that."
shoshy566,If your dad is willing to co-sign and you trust your dad to also be on this card with you then I’d advise you to get a travel card that’s *not* a student card. Typically student cards have worse rewards than normal credit cards and they really aren’t too different other than that. If this is your first credit card then it might be easiest for you to get one through the same bank you have your checking account with. Just make sure that the card doesn’t have any fees associated with it. Also make sure that you aren’t going to be carrying a balance over into new billing cycles. You always want to pay your card down to $0 every month so that you can build your credit and not pay insane fees.
shoshy566,"Yeah, I asked my mom today why their financial advisor wanted to claim me as a dependent. My mom said that the only thing they pay for is insurance (we go through a plan with my dad's company) so I think the financial advisor just had a misunderstanding as to the amount that they covered vs what I covered. My dad likes to play it up and act like he's paying for my education because he cosigned my loans so I can see why there would be some confusion here."

Do you have info as to the interest rate range they charge their clients? And how much have you put in? Like, what’s the most you’ve ever put in at one point?

Edit: accidentally called it a pyramid scheme instead of Ponzi scheme"
shoshy566,"Considering how your “business” with Chase consisted of the blatant misuse of their cards, I’d say that’s no sweat off their back.

Now, if I were you I’d be more concerned that they’re going to go after you for the money you stole from them."
shoshy566,"Make sure that you cancel the autopay at least a week in advance (this will vary between different lenders). Otherwise the payment might go through anyways and you’ll have to wait for a refund.

I don’t think there are any other downsides to this."
shoshy566,"The only advantages I can think of would be that you’d have the money in your checking account in case of emergencies and that paying off the debt would lower their credit score a little because it is a line of credit that they’re closing off.

Making $200k per year and having $100k in savings while keeping $60k in debt doesn’t make much sense to me unless they think they’re going to have a large expense in the future that they need to pay cash."
shoshy566,"Yeah, that can be a big issue. As far as her forgetting to take them, try setting up a reoccurring alarm so that she knows when the best time is. As far as her not wanting to take them, it may be worth it to get into contact with her therapist and psychologist and discuss that with them. They might be able to help her with the emotions she's feeling about having to take medication."
shoshy566,"In almost all cases this would be a good idea but obviously it does depend on the interest rates of your loan and your credit card’s APR.

In my opinion the better idea may be to open up another credit card and transfer the balance to that. There are a lot of cards with a 0% initial balance transfer fee and a 0% APR for the first x months. If you’re able to pay back the 5k within those x months then this would be the better way to go in my opinion."
shoshy566,"I understand your situation here of needing to try but I feel like I need to offer some advice here which I learned a while ago with my parents: learn when to walk away. 
It sounds harsh, but ultimately while they might value your input, it doesn't mean they're going to change. Sometimes you need to get yourself out of a situation before you become too involved in it to realize that you're too involved."
shoshy566,"Came here to say this. Typically people who's ability to make financial decisions are revoked have Alzheimer's disease or some other form of dementia that make them unfit all the time. Having bipolar is different since she's fit most of the time but has manic episodes where she becomes reckless. Honestly, it sounds like she's doing pretty okay with the manic episodes too. There are people with bipolar who do far more destructive things financially than $2000 worth of loans. Granted, ideally she would never have manic episodes but the best way to go about that is making sure she has the proper care (a psychiatrist and medication). "
shoshy566,"That’s great! It seems like you’re in a good position to apply for a travel card with your bank. Most banks offer them. Personally I use BOA since they have locations just about everywhere and I travel a lot. I know for a fact that they offer one with no foreign transaction fees and points that go towards miles for when you fly.

In the future since you’ll have this card you should make sure to treat it like a debit card essentially. Never put a balance on it that’s greater than the amount of money you have and always pay that balance down to $0 by the end of the month. If you start using your credit card instead of your debit card then you’ll build credit which is definitely something you’ll want to do sooner rather than later.

Also, just remember to be responsible with your card. If you don’t have a job right now then no bank is going to give you a card without your dad on it as well. This means that your dad is equally responsible for any balance on the card so just remember that any financial mistakes you make will effect his credit as well. It’s a big responsibility."
shoshy566,"If you already have the money saved up you might as well get a credit card to take advantage of any cash back/traveler’s miles.

Since you’re not a US citizen (I’m assuming) I don’t know how the application process would work. You might be best off applying for a credit card in your home country and to just make sure that there are no foreign transaction fees associated with it.

Edit: Also other advice-
1) In the US taxes are not included and they very by state. 
2) Know the conventions for tipping."
shoshy566,"Okay, interesting. Thank you! My parents provided me with 0% financial support since 2015 so they fail the Support Test.

Also, for one of the tests it states that the child must be living with the parent for 6 months out of the year but it also states that there is an exception to the rule for both education and business. Now, the last time I was in CT for more than a few days was in 2017 due to my internship.  Is this what they're referring to when they mean ""business"" or are they referring to my parent's business?"
shoshy566,"I actually agree with OP on this one. It’ll help in the long run if you’re going to keep it. But you need to be smart about it too. Get something that will benefit you in the future like an SUV or something with decent gas mileage instead of a sports car. Think about what you’ll be doing for college and what you want to do for life after college and choose a car that will benefit that lifestyle.

Something to note- I actually had a Mustang as my first car. It was an awesome car and I loved it a lot but I went to college in upstate NY where we got lots of snow so it just wasn’t feasible to bring with me from CT. It sat in my driveway for a long time and eventually I just sold it because it was sad to see it rotting away and it was starting to have problems from sitting out for like a year at a time."
shoshy566,"This is a horrible idea even if you do get approved by a lender. Not only does this option have a ton of risk, but you’re just asking to hurt your relationships with your friends when shit goes down, which it inevitably will because that’s just how these things go even if your friends are the greatest people in the world.

If you are able to get approved by a lender and if you all do decide to go through with this deal please please *please* make sure you all see a lawyer and draw up a legal agreement as to what happens should someone want to leave, etc."
FabulousCoat,"Don't time the market.  This person is trying to predict that the market will shit itself and that you are better hanging onto your cash so you can invest when everything is down.  Put your funds into the vanguard total market fund and don't worry about it.  You are 23, not 58, so it doesn't matter much.  

When the market does have a downturn (and it will, just don't know when) ride it out and don't freak.  You don't plan on using 401k money for a long time and unless we have complete societal collapse, the money will outlast any downturn we will have."
FabulousCoat,"For mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard is a fine choice.  Fidelity and Schwab are also good choices.

As others have said, pay off any high interest debt, setup an E-Fund, then look at the side bar for the prime directive as well as Windfalls.  From there you should be able to setup a brokerage account (lets say at Vanguard) with a 3 or 4 fund mix that should check the boxes and be very low fee."
FabulousCoat,"vanguard is fine as they don't charge commission for 1800 or so ETFs, similar to Charles Schwab and Fidelity.  

Assuming you bought one of the commission-free ETFs, you are fine.  Sometimes all you can do is buy one or two shares of an ETF.  

The problem happens when you buy a share of something that charges commission."
GunnoZero,"If it's been officially transferred to you (you've both signed the title and had it notarized at an authorized agent), then you are the sole owner and there is no need for him to be present in Alabama.  I'm not an expert though.  You may be better off in r/legaladvice"
GunnoZero,"Well...at least getting evicted isn't a worry for you.  Anyway, there are a lot of potential laws, whether at the borough or county level, that may make short-term rentals illegal; you should check.  Also, make sure you pay appropriate taxes on any income generated, including potential tax on short-term rentals."
GunnoZero,"I have used both Fidelity and Vanguard, and have never had any issues or concerns.  In fact, some time ago I needed to call Fidelity and was presently surprised by a US-based call center staffed with friendly, knowledgeable people.  Granted, I've had no issues warranting reaching out to Vanguard, but that by itself is a good thing.   "
GunnoZero,"That's awesome.  Sounds like you're in great shape and making excellent choices to be in even better shape.  Wells Fargo happens to be one of the institutions that allows a weekly payment, which works especially well if you also get paid weekly.  They also make extra principle payments easy, so whatever works for you.

Assuming your $15k is at least three months worth of expenses, you're good to go there (unless one of your sources of income is uncertain, then you may need more).

Fully funding the 401k creates a tax benefit of $4,180 ($19k \* .22) this year.  I'm a fan of maximizing today's benefit because it's a sure thing, vs. a ""who knows?"" down the road.  If you're able to do that and still have extra to invest, then I think a Roth at that point is a great choice.  "
GunnoZero,"You may want to check out r/legaladvice

If you’re being garnished, then you were sued and a judgement was entered against you, most likely for not showing up since you didn’t receive notice. Rules vary by state, but you have to be notified of pending legal action, and the company should have proof of notification. In my state, you have to be served by a Sherriff.  It might get sticky if you were tardy in updating your address when you moved.  You should check if there is an attorney that will provide a free consultation on this, as if they can’t prove notification, you might have a case.  Otherwise, you’ll spend more on a lawyer then the cost of settling the debt.

The inflated amount is fees, penalties, and they likely tacked on their court costs.

Good luck! "
GunnoZero,"Directly from the IRS:

 Insolvent estate. Generally, if a decedent's estate is insufficient to pay all the decedent's debts, the debts due to the United States must be paid first. Both the decedent's federal income tax liabilities at the time of death and the estate's income tax liability are debts due to the United States. The personal representative of an insolvent estate is personally responsible for any tax liability of the decedent or of the estate if he or she had notice of such tax obligations or failed to exercise due care in determining if such obligations existed before distribution of the estate's assets and before being discharged from duties. The extent of such personal responsibility is the amount of any other payments made before paying the debts due to the United States, except where such other debt paid has priority over the debts due to the United States. Income tax liabilities need not be formally assessed for the personal representative to be liable if he or she was aware or should have been aware of their existence. "
GunnoZero,"That's awesome!  I was well into adulthood before learning pork chops weren't supposed to be ""chewy"".  My mother was many, many wonderful things, but a good cook was not necessarily one of them.

My wife will begin working full-time for a local university soon, and I plan to take advantage of the tuition discount!

I admire the dedication to sport.  I was in Judo as a young man, and miss it desperately.  I live in  a relatively rural place now, and no good Judo school around...I may have to take a page out of your book and get into something new! "
GunnoZero,"Are there any employer sponsored options? You should take full advantage of those if they're available.  You should also work towards a proper emergency fund (3-6 months expenses), preferably in something safe and pretty liquid, such as a high-yield savings account (I like Discover Bank; can be all done on-line).  I think that's a good start!"
GunnoZero,"There is no penalty for withdrawing from a Roth, because the money has already been taxed.  You will, however, have to pay tax on any gains.

I always have a hard time telling folks to raid a retirement account, but it might be your best option.  More importantly though, is making sure you understand how you got yourself into this sort of situation with the CC's, and ensuring you don't end up back in the same spot in the near future, but this time without the safety net of your Roth."
GunnoZero,"Good for you getting started early.
It’s ultimately up to you, but I’m a HUGE fan of target date funds.  It will always be automatically adjusted to keep your asset mix correct, and will automatically get less aggressive as you approach that date.  Also, they tend to be the lowest expense funds available, which shouldn’t be overlooked."
GunnoZero,"The short answer is yes.  Your balance relative to the amount of credit you have will impact your score.  How much is hard to say, but you have a great score, so I’d think not a lot.

That being said, the mortgage you're about to be responsible for will also impact your score, more so than the card will. The mortgage is installment debt, which affects your score differently, but until you prove your ability to pay your new debt on time (probably about 6 months), your score will go down.  No big deal if you’re not planning any other purchases, such as a car.

Anyway, congrats on the condo! (edit - spelling)"
GunnoZero,"I've found the hardest part to be ""finding the time"".  I made some personal decisions a while back to increase my free time by eliminating things from my life that sucked up my time without making me better in some way.  For instance, I got off of most social media platforms.  I found I wasted a tremendous amount of time checking in on things that added no value to my life.

I recently began helping out at my local food bank.  It takes way less time than you'd think, the people are amazing, and I haven't regretted it for one second.

Don't discount the importance of your meal prep!  It's not easy, and truly fuels you.  I usually have some sort of posting caveat (""I'm not a CPA"", etc.), but, I work with food :)  Good for you! Time well spent!  "
GunnoZero,"Read this:

&amp;#x200B;

In your situation, I'm a fan of a fee-only financial adviser to assist you with what your goals are vs. your current financial situation, and helping you understand how to best use your money (including the windfall) to accomplish those goals.  The fear is understandable, and a good CFP can help you mitigate that (and consider that) when choosing the right path with you.  Good luck!"
GunnoZero,"I'm very sorry for your family's loss.

You may find more specific advice in r/legaladvice.

I would check with your health insurance and/or your employer to see if they offer a health advocate service.  My employer offers this for free.  They can help you wade through the various bills, insurance issues, etc. and advocate on your behalf.   "
GunnoZero,"1. I like maxing out 401k contributions if you can afford to do it, because it all goes in pretax.  Make sure you math out the contributions over the course of the year (including bonuses and raises) to ensure you are also getting the company match for all 52 weeks of the year.  
2. If you're maxing out your 401k, then I think a Roth IRA is your next best choice to park money.  Money here will be taxed already, but withdrawn tax free at retirement, so it's a nice hedge.  
3. If you still have money left over to invest (good for you!), then a good financial adviser will be worth every penny.  "
GunnoZero,"Depends entirely on the shops around you.  Call around with the size of your tire, and you'll get a lot of different quotes for different brands.  Ask if anything is on special or has a rebate.  Check [tirerack.com](https://tirerack.com) and see who they work with in your area.  Check Sam's Club too if you have one near you.

I use a locally owned business that only sells name brand tires (Cooper, Continental, etc.).  I pay a hair more, but I prefer a name I've heard of for my tires, and the shop does lifetime rotation and alignment for free with install, so I think it evens out."
GunnoZero,"My apologies - I was wrong on my previous response.  15 years is that standard for depreciation of a capital improvement.  

As far as I am aware, there is no other means of deduction.  This rule is dictated by the IRS, which is likely why your accountant just went ahead and did it as opposed to consulting you, because there is no second option."
GunnoZero,"I definitely understand the hesitation.  I've personally found my 401k to be my best performing investment, no doubt due to the fact that gains are also tax free until withdrawal.  That's what you get in exchange for having to wait to touch it; tax free income at the time of investment and tax free growth.  Depending on what tax bracket you're in, that can be a substantial amount of tax avoided.  

&amp;#x200B;

I'd say that you always have the option of taking a loan against the balance, but I think that by even posting here you have enough money to establish an adequate emergency fund, which is a must before funneling money elsewhere.  Also, in the event of a true emergency, there are ways to get at it without the penalty (extraordinary medical bills, disaster relief, forced early retirement at 55+, etc.).     "
GunnoZero,"I was in my own tight spot as a younger man; newly married, fresh out of school, and just had a baby.  Our debt was quickly out of control with credit cards, student loans, and our own foolish car purchase (it was one of those make no payments for a year deals) that we ended upside down on when the car was totaled and we owed more than it was worth (and now had no car).  My point is, you're not alone, you have the power to change course, and you're learning valuable financial lessons for the future.  It going to take hard work, frugal living, and patience, but you can do this.

You're definitely in a tight spot, but good for you for realizing that something has to change, and not just spiraling further into debt.  I'm a bit of a plain talker, so my apologies if any of this sounds harsh; it's just my two cents:

1. You already realize that buying the car was a mistake (as an aside, that's a pretty shady dealership for getting you into a seven year loan).  Having only paid one year of a seven year loan, my guess is that you'd be in the hole by about $5k if you somehow disposed of the car.  

* You can check the value yourself at a website like [kbb.com](https://kbb.com); it might be worth a bit more. 
* I don't think getting rid of the car is a realistic option unless you can find someone to buy it for what you owe, which is unlikely.  
* You could find yourself in an additional pickle a few years from now with maintenance costs on the car.  You do have the option of not driving it, not insuring it, and not registering it.  Tread carefully if you do this, every locality is a bit different, but generally you'd need somewhere out of sight to park it, like a garage. An untagged, unregistered car on the street will be towed.  To be clear, this is not a great option, and you should check locally to see what the rules are if you decide to do this.  Not driving a car also has a potential mechanical impact.

2.   You live in a VERY expensive area of the country for housing.  If you're capable of staying put, you should   
consider it.

3.   Without income, you'll continue to rack up debt, most likely using your credit card(s) for daily living   
expenses.  My personal opinion is that you're going to need a job, and find some way to balance work and   
school.  Don't get into the habit of using your card to pay for daily expenses' it adds up quick.  Our credit   
card hole was the same; we were using it to pay our insurance premiums because we didn't have the cash,   
and it quickly got out of control.  It's much harder to dig out than get in.

I would focus hard on not incurring additional debt at this point.  What's done is done, and again, good on you for realizing it and trying to put a stop to it.  You're studying in an excellent field with great employment prospects.  My guess is that you're going to get good at living a frugal lifestyle for the next few years, which will only help you appreciate what you have in the future, and hopefully set you on the path to financial freedom.  Good luck.    

&amp;#x200B;"
GunnoZero,"Quite a bit going on there. I'm sorry that you are feeling mistreated, and that is definitely grounds to look elsewhere.

Networking is almost always your best bet for finding a new position.  You say you don't have friends, but you can fix that.

Outside of that, the old saying is ""the best time to look for a job is when you already have one"".  You're fortunate to be in a position where you can  hold on to what you have while you see what else is out there.  No harm in applying for a few things and seeing where it takes you.  

The only thing you might run into is that without a job history and aforementioned friends, you don't really have references to list other than your current employer.  Not everyone checks references, but some do.  If a recruiter reaches out, you should be prepared to have the conversation of why you're looking elsewhere with your current employer.  Who knows, maybe that would lead to the salary bump you're looking for."
GunnoZero,If the debt was incurred while the gym was still open then it's a legitimate debt.  How much are we talking here?  It might be your best option to make an offer to collections (maybe half what you owe) to wipe it out.  They likely bought it for pennies on the dollar.
GunnoZero,"My first thought is you need to adjust your withholding.  You're giving Uncle Sam an interest-free loan every year.  Although I understand the allure of getting a big refund each year, you're better off setting up and investment account and auto-drafting that money out on the same frequency that you get paid.  That way, you still never ""see"" that money; it's a lot easier to save money you never really had in your possession, in my opinion.

First priority should be maxing out your 401k, taking full advantage of any company match along the way.  Make sure you math out the impact of your bonuses on this as well, to get the full benefit of the match all 52 weeks of the year.

That being said, if you live in a tax-advantaged state, I think 529 plans are a great investment vehicle, especially with 4 kids.

If you still have money left over (and good for you if you do!), hedging future tax obligation with a Roth IRA would be next on my list.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't necessarily have to be on your credit report; they may have never reported it to one of the agencies.  Odd, yes, but not unheard of."
GunnoZero,"I think that's awesome.  Something tells me you'd have to learn quite a bit in order to produce a high-quality twitch stream.  No real need to make money if you otherwise have a career (which you do), and are simply combining your hobby with learning new skills!"
annoyingtruth,"I'm guessing you're self employed? 

How much are you making? You might not even need to pay taxes depending on that. 

If you are employed your employer gives you a W-2. There are many free ways to file online that you can look up or just use turbo tax. 

"
annoyingtruth,You make 1.25x more than before. Overtime is 1.5x. So it just depends on how much overtime you were getting before but I'd definitely take salary in your case assuming they don't expect you to be working 50-60 hours a week now that you don't get overtime.   
annoyingtruth,"Traditional IRA - personal retirement account, reduce taxes now(if you contribute $5000 you reduce $5000 from your taxable income). 

ROTH IRA - personal retirement account, withdraw at retirement tax free since you pay taxes now.

401k - employer provided retirement plan. Generally most employers give you some sort of free match up to a certain percentage so it is the best way to save for retirement. 

General rule just try to save 15% of your income for retirement once you graduate and get a job. Anything outside of that just try to be frugal but don't pinch pennies, nothing wrong with going out or taking vacations. 

"
annoyingtruth,"Damn you were doing great on getting on top of your loans till you got that car. You can refinance it to ""restart"" the loan and make it a brand new 5 year loan with a lower interest rate to get the monthly payments lower. Since you have 24k left on it off the top of my head you can probably finance it to be $350/month or so but it'd be spread out longer. 

In order:

* Figure out what type of payment plan you can get on the car or even look into selling it and buying a used truck, I have no idea what your income/expenses are but if you think you can afford to keep it do so

* Make sure CC is paid off by next year, rate will skyrocket 

* 3% on the student loans is pretty low, this can be your smallest focus

* hospital bill just pay $70 for the next 8 months relatively low bill anyways "
annoyingtruth,"Sounds about right. Pet owners should honestly be saving $30-$50 a month in a separate account if they don't have access to a decent health insurance plan. Pet's healthcare can be just as costly as a regular human, if not even more since they are more prone to being unhealthy. "
annoyingtruth,"Owing money to the IRS isn't a bad thing. It just means you had more withholdings than you should have.

In fact owing money is better is generally better than receiving a refund - it means you received more money throughout the year($291.67/month) rather than giving Uncle Sam an interest free loan. 

That being said unless you have very complicated taxes (investments, crypto, real estate, tax breaks, etc.) you should just use a online tax software.  "
annoyingtruth,"A lot of people will tell you not to give your mom the money but just do it. Consider it a thank you for raising me and putting a roof over my head kinda thing. Sisters same thing since you are basically just repaying them.

Car I would try to get a reliable used but if you can get a low APR it's better to just put it on a loan payment to build your credit. 

Computer lots of good quality high end laptops in the $800-$1200 range. Don't get a gaming one battery life will be ass and it will be heavy/loud.

annoyingtruth,"Pretty hard spot until your child gets free daycare (yay for public schools!). 

You are right a near min wage job will not cover daycare and this is a very common problem. I'm guessing grandma/grandpa aren't around to watch the kid for cheap? 
"
annoyingtruth,"If it's the same position and you aren't a donkey you should always be paid more than newer hires, and the fact that you were their for their interview is hilariously awkward lol. 

It's also a normal thing for companies to hire new people at a higher rate than their current employees. "
annoyingtruth,"There is no safe investment for under 5 years other than a savings account.

And if it's a high school graduation you definitely will need that for college anyways.

And if it's a college graduation then you DEFINITELY will need that for adult stuff.

But if it's a middle school graduation that is basically 6 million dollars. "
annoyingtruth,"Is there any particular reason why you want to file? You technically don't need to, especially if you were paid mostly in cash. 

If you do want to file he doesn't have any forms for you. As long as you kept track of how much you made you can just pay tax based on that and download forms from the IRS website or file online via online software like TurboTax. 

"
annoyingtruth,"IRS has a withholding calculator on their site google and use that. If you don't think you are doing it correctly just follow whatever directions are on the W-4 sheet and put numbers where applicable most likely you will be writing 2-3 withholdings unless you have kids. 

401k you can roll it over but it's not automatic just call the 401k provider and they'll do it for you. "
annoyingtruth,"You probably own the shares by now. Just sell them, market went down a tiny bit today so you probably lost 5 bucks or so. 

Don't use a credit union to invest they don't know what they are doing and probably have high fees, open up your own brokerage account so you have full control of everything. "
annoyingtruth,"Welcome to the real world. People in the service industry rarely report cash tips, and most small business owners don't report most of their cash transactions. 

Plus in this case OP can file as self employed but doesn't need to file a tax return if income didn't pass a certain threshold(I think $12k?). "
annoyingtruth,"Why not? It means she pays no rent. 

OP your car payment will be approx $300-$400 between that range (22k to 26k) on a 5 year loan w/ 20% down and a normal APR. As long as you can fit that in your budget + insurance you should be fine. "
annoyingtruth,"There is literally nothing wrong with a credit card just set it to auto pay and only use it for what you normally buy. You should literally be using a credit card for 100% of purchases that you would have made anyways, with the right card you are getting 2-5% back in rewards based on purchase. 

Plus using a card for almost all your purchases makes budgeting a lot easier since you can see where all the money is going. 

"
annoyingtruth,"I'm pretty sure fidelty will just put you on a standard fund allocation of mostly total market and a small percentage of bonds.

The market dropped about 14% in 2018 but is for the most part recovered by now so your fund is performing just about as expected and completely normal. 
"
coolman2311,"Just wanted to revisit this: I finally understand what you were saying. After I dedicated more time to research, I figured out more things. I realized  that I really have no need for much bonds right now. Thanks 

I crossed-referenced multiple leaders in the field and saw that they recommend more bonds for people who cant handle the swings in equities (regardless of age). You cant avoid declines anyway, having more bonds will merely lessen the decline you experience but you still have to remain composed. 

As an update im actually going 60% US stocks, 20% International, 20% Real estate"
coolman2311,"I prefer to have a nice mix. No more than 75% in any asset class. No lower than 25% in stocks/bonds at any given time.

coolman2311,"Ok but you’re telling a young guy to forgo getting a credit card because of your fears vs solving his issue. He wants a card, he isn’t qualified through his bank USAA and is willing to open an account elsewhere if need be. There’s no better way to start than getting a CC.

Him getting bills in his name is basically like opening up another account anyway right? Utilities check your credit and he has a limited history so that doesn’t sound like a valid strategy in terms of what he wants to avoid. "

Good luck!"

coolman2311,"Different Asset Allocation Strategies for Multiple Accounts? Hi, 

I want to know does it make sense for anyone to have different asset allocation strategies for different accounts? For instance, some securities make more sense in tax-sheltered accounts versus being in a taxable account. 

For my Roth IRA I am aiming to do as followed: 

50% Stocks (35% US, 15% International)
30% Bonds (30% Total US Bond market) may consider international exposure 
20% Real Estate (15% US, 5% International)

For my taxable account:

60% Stocks (40% US, 20% International) 
40% Bonds (40% Tax exempt bond fund)

From my understanding, many individuals talk about asset allocation in terms of your whole portfolio. I feel that it is much more convenient to apply different allocation strategies to separate accounts as needed. It makes no sense to hold REITs or regular bond funds in a taxable account therefore my allocation would be thrown off as a whole as a result of this change. 

I want input on this, does it make sense and do I have the right idea? Thank you!
"

20% Real Estate - 15 US, 5 International

Hello,


I'm working on my Year 2018 taxes.  I see the same situation coming up possibly that I considered in the past although a few details have changed.


I am still in repayment on my federal student loan for a few more years.  That's based on my AGI.  So if I lower my AGI on my federal taxes, my student loan payments are lower (by 15%, I'm on income based repayment) for 12 months.  That's sticking money in a traditional retirement account so I'm not paying taxes now.  Whatever amount I can stick in an IRA (up to the max on that) would be the basis for my student loan recalculation, which uses 15% of income above the poverty line, so it would be ""saving"" 15% of that max IRA contribution on my next 12-month student loan payment cycle.  For example, if $5,500 is the max IRA contribution for Year 2018 taxes, 15% is $825.  If I do nothing with the IRA, my adjusted gross income is up $5,500, and I pay $825 over the near-future 12-month student loan repayment cycle.  If I do max out the $5,500, my student loan gets recalculated $825 lower over that next 12-month repayment cycle.  There's no future retirement tax waiting on the student loan.  My student loan should be forgiven in a few years.  I'm on track for that.  In a sense, it's investing $5,500 in a traditional IRA (pay taxes later when I take it out) but it gets me back $825 in the near-future.  That's already a 15% return ""now"" (during the next 12-month student loan repayment cycle) on that $5,500.


Change since 2016 -- My job changed a little.  I now have benefits, including retirement.  It some kind of traditional retirement.  I'm thinking that's not a Roth, so I'm probably not paying taxes now.  I'm paying x% of my income into that.  I'm looking at my Year 2018 W2 though.  I can't tell if my #1 ""Wages, tips, other comp,"" includes what I would have paid into the employeer's retirement thing.  The retirement option wasn't an option.  It was a ""choice"" between their retirement plan options.  A percent of my income went into that, no opt out choice.  I bring this up since it would affect how much I might pay into an IRA now (for Year 2018).


I did set up a Vanguard account around 2016, but never used it.  As far as I know, it's still there, ready to go.  I was thinking when I decide on this, I could drop some money in that (minimum IRA is $3,000 I think, or was in 2016).  I'm not sure how I get the paperwork for Year 2018 taxes though so have the Year 2018 IRS forms filled out properly).


So my goal is to reduce my AGI on federal taxes for Year 2018 by throwing money into an IRA.  What's the max retirement contribution allowed for Year 2018 (was $5,500 in Year 2017 I think)?  I wonder if I'm missing a form from the work retirement plan.  I'm not sure how much I (was forced) contribute to that for Year 2018.


It looks like on IRS 1040 year 2018, Schedule 1, line 32, there's a spot for IRA contributions.  That uses form 8606.  I don't see a ""maximum of $5,500"" or anything like that anywhere though.....


It looks like I'd only be doing this year and maybe next year if I decide to do it.  I'm just fuzzy on how to contribute to Vanguard with an IRA, how to get paperwork for Year 2018 from them, how much I can max out that IRA deduction (if that's $5,500), if anything from work retirement now affects that....
Back on my Year 2018 W2 form from work, I do have box 13 checked for retirement plan now.


Found this.

https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-ira-contribution-limits
""For 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, your total contributions to all of your traditional and Roth IRAs cannot be more than:

$5,500 ($6,500 if you’re age 50 or older), or
your taxable compensation for the year, if your compensation was less than this dollar limit.""

I could have sworn I had some comments from a couple years ago about this, but I'm not finding them....."

I think someone on here said $5,500 is the max for year 2018 (under age 50) but you could still contribute more if you wanted.  You just can't take it off your taxes, if it's a traditional IRA.  (I suppose you'd be paying taxes on it then, so a Roth IRA might be better.)


Or is that set up that you cannot contribute more and get any tax benefits, that they only allow so much per year?"
lowermyagi2016111,"So if the person who told me ""but that's not federally insured!"" has an IRA themself, their IRA must not be federally insured, or they shifted it all toward more conservative things?  Or maybe they were getting an IRA confused with a CD....  Or I'm blurring things up.  If Vanguard offered CDs, and I was looking at that, maybe that's what I'm remembering.  ""Hey, Vanguard has much better interest rates on CDs.  I was thinking of building a CD ladder.""  ""What!?  Are you nuts?  That's not federally insured!  You should get one from the local bank."""
lowermyagi2016111,"Look up negotiation.  It doesn't sound like you're in a bad spot.  What's the worst that happens?  Nothing.  What's the best?  You get a raise.

I would focus on what skills you have, what you're doing that's good, remind them of projects or things that turned out successful.  I would stay away from any negatives, but if it comes up, spin it in a positive light -- You learned something from that and are improving in that area.  You'd do something different next time because you learned from it.

You can also mention time in with the company.  And experience doing your job overall.  Even if it doesn't quite fit the job, you can remind them of experience that *might* benefit the job and count it as some experience or ""professional experience"" at least.


Are you doing anything to improve job skills?  Any professional development?


What about cost of living?  If they're not giving you a raise to keep up with inflation, you're actually getting paid less ""value"" each year. Surely they should value you as much now as they did at the start, or even more since you've got a little more experience... right?


If you can scope out similar jobs in the same geographic region, that's good too.  That's the market value.  On another hand, it doesn't matter how great you are -- This is the job they want, and this is how much your area is paying for that work.  If you've got more, great, but they only really need what the job needs.


Or do they?  Do you want to take on some more work?  Do something a little different or more with your work?  (Or are you already doing more since somebody else left?)  And shouldn't you get paid for that extra work you're already doing or can do in the future?


Consider that it's possible someone wants to give you a raise.  They just need some help, some reasons, to justify it.


If you're talking to someone, don't be afraid to leave pauses.  They might cave and add in more, tell you more, or just give you a raise then.  If they said, ""Why should we give you a raise at all?"" you can say, ""Well, there's cost of living to start... I mean, we're going to keep up with inflation at least... right?  That's only fair to be paid the some value each year, right?  You're not valuing my work any less this year, right?  ......""  And then leave an awkward pause.   How do you say no to that?   (They say no one else got a raise either.  It's out of their hands.  


Some things can be spun off as a low grade threat too.  Why a raise?  Because there are three similar job position openings in the area and they each pay x amount, but the job you're at now pays less.  (Implying you could just job hop for higher pay.)


Those are just some ideas though.  Search for info under ""negotiation.""  There's a lot out there.  If you go through enough, when something comes up during the meeting, you can remember enough gist of what to say then.


There are psychological tricks too, like supposedly if they have something warm in their hands, they're more open toward helping you.   Or if you do something for them or ask them for a favor, that helps their impression of you so they feel obligated to help you out too.  You could even use that during the meeting if it's worded carefully.... ""I've been meaning to ask you about that.  I was thinking of doing this for professional development.  Do you think that's a good idea?  Would it help my career here to improve in that area, or is there something else you think I should be focusing on for professional development?""


Also, practice it.  Have some talking points or a schpiel made up already.  Practice it with another person.  Practice it by imagining the other person.  Record yourself and see how it sounds.  If possible, check out the room you'll be meeting with them in so you're more comfortable there."
lowermyagi2016111,"Something traditional because it wasn't included in my federal income.  I took the job and they said, ""Your pay is this much, and you pay x% to retirement.""  Everyone pays that percentage of their gross income toward retirement.   So my reaction at first was, ""All right.  That's more money than I'm making now,"" followed by, ""Oh,"" when I realized the mandatory retirement percent lowered that.  Still, it's more for retirement.... assuming everything still exists when I retire.  I won't be surprised if when I retire, I hear, ""Yeah.... We just can't give you the money back.  We don't actually have it anymore.  That money went to pay people's retirement years ago.  The whole thing was set up by people decades ago.  It's not our fault.  But we're just not going to be able to give you what we said we would decades ago...."""
lowermyagi2016111,"Are 401K's essentially an IRA but through your workplace?  That's what I was thinking.  


I want the IRA, traditional, to lower my adjusted gross income, and just to set up money in a retirement account.  My student loan payments are based off my AGI, so a lower AGI now means lower student loan payments (essentially) now.  Add in loan forgiveness, and I never have to pay back any more on the student loan.  I save the student loan payment in the short term future."
lowermyagi2016111,"But Vanguard's not federally insured? I looked into setting up an IRA a couple years ago.  Never actually pulled the trigger and put any money in it though.  I saw the overall interest rates were something like 11 or 12%.  Whatever it was.  Good return for return interests rates though.  So I mentioned that to someone else -- Hey, look at this Vanguard thing.  The interest rates look good.  Looks like it's a slow growing good thing... right?  Their response?  ""No, no.  That's not federally insured.  Are you nuts?  You could lose all your money.  You want these federally insured ones....""  But the interest rates are more like half (in 2016) of what Vanguard had.  

I believe the IRA thing (yep, I'm a noob for this, not stupid, but much more on the noob side) was based off top performing stocks, etc.  So in order to lose money, the entire US economy would have to tank.  (Or is that the Great Depression....?  Except a Vanguard IRA isn't just stocks either...)


So what say you, those-who-know-more-about-this-than-me?  And how would you respond to that person who says, ""I don't know.  You might lose all your money there.  They're not federally insured.  Why don't you put that into a federally insured IRA with the local bank (with half the interest rate)?""

I'm still thinking over the life of the IRA, it's ""safe enough.""  If I've got a Vanguard IRA, social security, whatever else has been tacked on jobs for retirement... That's also diversifying things a bit that way."
lowermyagi2016111,"Are you forced to deplete an IRA in the future? Roth or traditional.... When you get up to age 68 or whatever it is, you're forced to start removing some money from your IRA, right?

Is the whole IRA thing set up to incentivize saving with tax breaks, but then also set up on the other end to force you to withdraw that money?  Otherwise, couldn't you leave some there, continue drawing interest.... I guess you'd die at some point.   (Can you will an IRA to someone else who can keep getting that tax benefit?  An unending Roth IRA payout generation after generation?)


Or is it just set up that you're forced to withdraw some, then more and more, and eventually that IRA has a zero balance?  Assuming you ""outlive"" the IRA like that."
lowermyagi2016111,"US, Federal tax -- How can I have them take less out if I am the dependent=1? (First World problem)  I always get back money for federal income taxes.  I'm single.  My W-4 has 1.  I thought that was the minimum/lowest number I could put there.  I remember reading that there's a penalty if you don't pay enough in taxes over the year though.   My HR won't comment except to say I should check with my tax advisor (that's reddit here) and that it's possible to claim 0 on my W-4.

How can I lower the amount taken out for taxes if my W-4 is already 1 now without getting any penalties or without it being a lot of extra work?  I don't want to spend a huge amount of time on paperwork.  But each year I look at what I get back and wonder why I gave the government an interest free loan for the year on that."
lowermyagi2016111,"What would I need to do to drop money in a Vanguard IRA for Year 2018 taxes? If I want to max out the $5,500 Year 2018 federal income taxes option, and I already created a Vanguard account and linked it to my bank account a couple years ago, what would I need to do to drop $5,500 in a Vanguard IRA to lower my adjusted gross income on federal taxes?  I should see if the account still works.  Otherwise, it looked like I just had to click a few buttons to transfer money when I checked in 2016.  

How do I get the form from Vanguard for my Year 2018 taxes though?  If I drop money with them today, can I just print off a webpage for my IRS 1040 to prove that I put money in an IRA for Year 2018?  Or do I have to wait for Vanguard to mail me something?"
lowermyagi2016111,"Is this right for taxes? I can pay for a traditional IRA and also get Premium Tax Credit for health insurance? I can not take a traditional IRA, and I go through my taxes normally.  For the advanced premium tax credit section, form 8962, I'm in the 401% so I don't qualify for anything there.  I have Marketplace health insurance in Year 2018 so I still need to show I didn't take any money and don't owe any money.  I still complete the form 8962 and it zeroes out.


But if I max out the IRA contribution at $5,500, my adjusted gross income is lower.  Then on the Form 8962 I did qualify for advanced premium tax credit.  I didn't take any though so this is where things even out.  I would get money back.  I'm not seeing anything in the instructions, but if I'm able to put money into an IRA (traditional), am I still able to take that tax credit for health insurance?  Wouldn't someone creating the tax workflow say, ""Well, if you've got enough money to put some into retirement, you can put that money into your own health insurance instead,"" and not allow that to happen?


Otherwise, it's just more incentive to put money into an IRA.  I save some on my student loan (which is calculated based on AGI) payment cycle in the near future, and then I get money back for the health insurance subsidy.  Is that allowed?  That's what I'm wondering.  I figured I must in that niche area where it actually works out that way this year."
eagleblitz20,"Your results are perfectly normal.

Your fund is divided into 64% US stocks, 27% international stocks, and 9% bonds. 

The US stock market dropped approximately 15% last December and has gained it all back since. Hence why to you it seems like there hasn't been any movement in your account.

Google ""FDEWX"" to look at the chart or here is a quick link to see what I'm talking about:

https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/fdewx

Index fund prices are update once a day, usually between 5:30-6:00 PM EST. Today was a good day for US stocks and your FDEWX went up by 1.28%. Your account will increase to $321 once Fidelity updates it. 

Continue to invest money and don't make a habit of checking the fund's performance every day. Remember, you are 35 years away from retirement. You will always make money in the long run. 

 "
eagleblitz20,"Unrealized gain/loss is value. You buy shares of a company and your investment goes up and down in value depending on how the stock performs. You haven't made or lost money until you sell those shares.

Think of buying a house for $100,000 for example. The value of the house fluctuates from year to year. It might be worth $95,000 the next year depending on the market and $105,000 the year after that. You do make make profit or take a loss until you actually decide to sell the house. 

Cumulative return is expressed as a % I believe. You bought $1000 worth of shares today, they go up in value to $1050 in a month for example, your cumulative return is 5%."
eagleblitz20,"An expense ratio of 0.08% means that you pay $0.80 yearly fee for every $1,000 invested into the fund. At $10,000 invested, that comes out to $8 per year. ER of 0.15% is $1.50 yearly fee for every $1,000 invested and $15 for every $10,000 invested. 

If you want to have your 401K and IRAs in one place for convenience, then it makes sense. But switching brokerage accounts for 0.07% savings is silly. Especially if you started buying into those funds a couple of years ago when they were trading cheaper. Today, $100 buys you less shares than it did a couple of years ago. 

Both funds had identical returns in the last 3 years. VFIFX performed a little better in 2017 while SWYMX has had slightly better returns in 2018 and 2019. End result is that VFIFX averaged 0.06% better annual return (CAGR) than SWYMX and when you include the 0.07% difference in fees, that comes out to $1 per year for every $10,000 invested.

A target date fund, VFIFX or SWYMX, is already diversified. It's a mix of US and international stocks and bonds. The further away you are from retirement age, the heavier it tilts toward stocks which are volatile but have higher returns than bonds in the long run. As you start to approach retirement age, the % stocks and % bonds automatically start to tilt heavier toward bonds which are less volatile. 

Here is how VFIFX allocated:

Vanguard Total US Stock - 54% (3,567 companies)

Vanguard Total International Stock - 36% (6,270 companies)

Vanguard Total US and International Bonds - 10%

The fund is already very diversified. Your goal now should be to throw money into the fund and accumulate as many shares as possible. It trades at $36.65 per share now and when it trades at $100 per share in 30 years, having more shares will equate to higher returns. "
eagleblitz20,"Sure thing.

FXAIX plus some small/mid cap index funds sound reasonable. But be careful not to overlap again. Small cap index funds are notorious for approximately 60/40 to 50/50 small to mid cap split. And mid cap index funds can have 40% large caps in them. Be cautious.

In the subsection of ""PORTFOLIO"" you will see ""HOLDINGS"" to check the number of holdings in the fund and their weight."
eagleblitz20,"1) Does employer automatically contribute 2%  or do you have to contribute a certain percent to get that match? For example, company X requires a 6% minimum contribution for which they will match 4.5%. 

2) Is there a vesting period? Most companies require you to work X amount of years to get the full or partial employer match. For example, 100% vesting after 3 years of service. Or 25% vesting after one year, 50% after year two, etc. What you (as employee) contribute is not subject to vesting period. You keep your contributions whenever you decide to leave the company.

3) What are yearly maintenance fees for the 401K? You company sends the money to a brokerage firm which offer investing options. Brokers charge a yearly fee. It's probably around $50. Some employers cover those fees. You want to find out. 

4) How old are you? What is your risk tolerance? This is important information to consider when choosing how to allocate your investments. "

eagleblitz20,"JUEMX is a large cap index fund (92% large cap, 8% mid cap) with 0.44% expense ration (141 holdings) [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/juemx/quote.html](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/juemx/quote.html)

FSMAX is a mid cap index fund (9% large cap, 53% mid cap, 33% small cap, 5% micro cap) with 0.05% expense ratio (3115 holdings) [https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fsmax/quote.html](https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/fsmax/quote.html)

BTSMX (mid cap) 0.75% ER is not worth even considering due to high expense ratio compared to FSMAX

JUEMX's returns over the last 10 years mirrored those of S&amp;P 500. It sucks that the expense ratio is so high (for comparison, Vanguard and Schwab's index funds that track S&amp;P 500 are offered at &lt;0.05 ER). Difference between 0.05% vs 0.44% ER is $0.50 vs $4.40 per $1,000 invested. On $40K, that's $20 vs $176.

FSMAX outperformed S&amp;P 500 over the last 10 year. Historically, mid and small caps have outperformed large caps as well. However, they are more volatile.

An 80% JUEMX / 20% FSMAX allocation will probably mimic a Total Market index fund (approx 85% large caps, 15% mid/small caps). Tilt heavier toward FSMAX the more risk you can tolerated. For example, I allocated my portfolio 33% large/mid/small each because, like you, I'm 30 years away from retirement and willing to tolerate high risk. My wife's portfolio is 100% in Total Market fund for less risk.

eagleblitz20,"Target Date Funds are perfect for people who prefer the ""put money in and forget it"" approach. There is nothing wrong with that. 

Vanguard Target Retirement 2050 Fund (VFIFX) has the following allocation: 

54% Vanguard Total Market Index (VTSMX) which further breaks down into approximately 76% US large/giant caps, 17% mid cap, 7% small caps

36% Vanguard Total International Stock Index (VGTSX)

10% US/International Bonds

If your remaining 37% is allocated into similar funds, then there is a lot of overlap and you're paying extra yearly expenses (expense ratios of the funds) for no reason. 

If you want to tilt heavier toward other specific areas of the market, then it's fine. 

Whatever allocation you choose is fine. Again, you want just to avoid overlap and end up paying unnecessary fees. "
eagleblitz20,"Assuming you have a traditional 401K (pre-tax contributions), you wouldn't want to rollover the money into a Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account) because that's an after-tax account. That means you'd have to pay taxes to be able to put it into Roth IRA. 

You can roll your money into a Traditional IRA which is still a pre-tax account. A 401K is an employer offered retirement plan while an IRA is an individual retirement plan not dependent on employer. 

https://www.schwab.com/public/schwab/investing/retirement_and_planning/understanding_iras/rollover_ira/401k_rollover_options

The benefit on rolling over to Traditional IRA is that you now have access to all mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETF) that the new broker offers. Generally, investment options offered by employer in 401K plans are very limited."
eagleblitz20,"Vanguard did a study which showed that lump sum investment at the beginning of the year outperformed dollar-cost averaging (DCA; basically payments spread out over an entire year) on average by 2.3% in the US since 1926.

[https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf](https://personal.vanguard.com/pdf/s315.pdf)

It's really nice that your employer continues to contribute the rest of the year once you max out your contributions. I'm 75% there, but have to do minimum contributions the rest of the year to get the employer match. I think that's the situation most people are in who try to front load at the beginning of the year.

eagleblitz20,"If you are holding individual stocks right now, you probably have a higher risk tolerance. 

Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VFIAX) - holds over 500 largest US companies. 

Vanguard Small Cap Index Fund (VSMAX) holds 1,390 US companies of which 62% are mid cap and 38% small cap

Both have expense ratio of 0.05% and lower. ER of 0.05% means that you pay $0.50 yearly fee for every $1,000 invested into the fund. Or $5 per year for every $10,000 invested. 

Vanguard total market fund like VTSAX which tracks the entire US market is broken down into approximately 77% large caps and 23% mid/small caps. 

Allocate similarly to that. Increase/decrease VSMAX % based on your risk tolerated. Historically, small and mid caps have outperformed large caps. However, they are more volatile and tend to lose more in down markets. 

Most importantly, pick an allocation and stick with it. The worst thing  you can do is start selling when the market starts dropping. In fact, when everyone is panicking, you should increase your contributions because you're buying shares at a discount. 

Play around with different allocations and see what works for you 
 https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/"
eagleblitz20,"100% stocks, 0% bonds is an aggressive allocation.

If you want to go ultra aggressive, forgo large caps and go with a mix of mid/small/micro cap index funds or exchange traded funds (ETF)

eagleblitz20,"Here is a chart that shows performance of US stock market vs Europe vs Asia since 1986. 

https://i.imgur.com/BA81Wxh.png

US is blue, Europe is red, Asia is yellow. CAGR is compound annual growth rate. That's the average annual return of each market. 

As you can see, US and European markets go through periods where one outperforms the other. However, from 1986 to 2014, their final returns were identical. US has pulled away and has significantly outperformed Europe in the last 5 years or so. 

Investing 100% into VTSAX is fine. It has a very small yearly expense ratio of 0.04% ($0.40 fee per $1,000 invested into the fund or $4 per $10,000) and with over 3,500 different companies in portfolio, it's very well diversified in regard to US market. 

A Vanguard 2060 Target Fund is a fine investment as well. The ""2060"" is your approximate retirement age. You can pick a further target date like Vanguard 2065 (VLXVX). The further away from retirement you are, the more stocks compared to bonds the fund holds. Difference between 2060 and 2065 are practically non existent. As you approach closer to retirement, your % of bonds will automatically increase and % of stocks will decrease. You can handle wild market swings now because you have a steady income and are 30+ years from retirement. But someone who is retired and depends financially solely on this money will not be able to handle a -30% yearly swing, for example. 

Vanguard 2060 Target Fund holds approximately 54% US stocks, 18% European stocks, 18% Asian stocks, and 10% bonds. VTSAX is already a holding in this fund and makes up the entire US portion. 

According to https://www.morningstar.com/funds/xnas/vttsx/quote.html Vanguard Target Fund 2060 (VTTSX) has an expense ratio of 0.15%. That comes out to a yearly fee of $1.50 per $1,000 invested into the fund. That's still a great ER and shouldn't really be the sole determining factor when picking between the two. 

If you invest in VTSAX, you'll probably have to manually start to allocate more % toward bonds when you turn 50 (earlier depending on your risk tolerance). With a Target Fund, that will be done automatically for you. That's your ""deposit money and forget it"" option. 

Third option is to just buy 60% VTSAX and 40% VTIAX (Vanguard Total International Stock; ER 0.11%). Or 50-50. Or 75-25. Your choice. This way you are invested only in global equities now and can manually buy bonds as you get closer to retirement.

Best of luck. 

EDIT: The fact that you have started at such a young age is far more important than any allocation you choose. Congratulations on that. You are well on your way to having over $1 million by the time you retire. 

https://www.investor.gov/additional-resources/free-financial-planning-tools/compound-interest-calculator

Using 7% conservative rate of return (S&amp;P 500 returned 9.8% annually over 90 years), over 40 years, comes out to over $1.310 million, tax free.  Add 1 extra year and it grows to $1.407 million. If you waited 8 years, turned 30, and just started to invest then, the same contributions and rate of return would yield only $726K. Almost 50% less. Let that sink in. 

"
eagleblitz20,"Great job starting so early. You are way ahead of the rest of us. I know I wasn't planning for retirement at that age!

Looking at your selections, two things stand out. One, you bought exchange traded funds (ETF) rather than index funds. They perform the same but one of the major differences is that you can only buy whole shares of ETFs while you can buy partial shares of index funds. For example, if you have $100 monthly to invest and want to buy shares of an ETF which trades at $75 per share, you can only buy 1 share and will have $25 left over. If the rest of ETFs on your list are all over $25 per share, you have to wait until the following month when you add another $100 to buy more shares. With an index fund, you can buy partial shares. For example, you can buy 1.33 shares worth of $75 index fund with $100.

If you prefer ETFs over index funds (you can buy ETF during trading hours which you cannot do with index funds), then you have to consider consolidating your list from 5 to 2, for example.  

For one, you have a lot of overlap between MGK and VUG. (Great job picking low expense ratio funds by the way) 

MGK $125 per share (69% mega / 31% large) with 120 holdings, 0.83% yield, ER 0.07%. Top 5 holdings are:

Apple 7.63%

Amazon 7.03% 

Microsoft 4.47%

Facebook 4%

Google 3.48% 

VUG: $157 per share (55% mega / 34% large / 11% mid), 302 holdings, Yield 1.18%, ER 0.05%. Top 5 holdings are:

Apple 6.20%

Amazon 5.71%

Microsoft 3.63%

Facebook 3.85%

Google 2.82%

Keep VBK and consolidate the other four into either MGK or VUG. This way you now only have two ETFs to fund rather than 5. 

Alternatively, you can buy Vanguard Large Cap Growth index funds like VIGAX or VIGRX which had identical returns to VUG. This way your $100 monthly investment will allow you to buy partial shares.

eagleblitz20,"Great job working and saving. 

The biggest investment you can make at this point is in yourself. Go to college or learn a trade. Pay for tuition so you don't have to take out student loans.

eagleblitz20,"Using your rules, what difference does it make what % is allocated toward rent/mortgage and car as long as it's around 43% total (33% + 10%)?

His mortgage is around 20% of his monthly income. Car is 11% (16% total if you include insurance). 

Still under 43% total.

EDIT: 500 / 4400 = 11.3%. Where did OP get 20% from? "
eagleblitz20,"A good rule of thumb is to focus on funds with lowest expense ratios. The difference in ER between ITOT and FXAIX is so tiny (0.03% vs 0.02%) that ER shouldn't really matter when picking between the two. 

An ER of 0.03% equates to $0.30 yearly fee per $1,000 invested into the fund. At $15K, that's $4.50 per year. At 0.02%, it's $3 per year. An extremely insignificant difference. 

An index fund tracks a specific sector or component of the market. For example, FTEC only tracks technology companies. It's the least diversified fund you are holding because it ignores all other sectors (auto, banking, pharmaceuticals, retail, etc. for example). With 214 holdings, it's also the least diversified in size. A fund that tracks only technology sector but has 1,000 holdings, for example, is more diversified. Diversification reduces risk. Let's say you have 10 pencils and your friend has 100 pencils. You both lose 1 pencil. You lost 10% of your total, he lost 1%. In a fund, you are diversifying to reduce risk of some companies severely underperforming or going bankrupt.  

ITOT is the most diversified fund in your Roth IRA. It tracks the entire stock market. Every sector is represented. With 3,565 holdings, it's also the most diversified relative to size. ITOT is actually an exchange traded fund (ETF) rather than an index fund. It trades like a regular stock and you can buy and sell an ETF during trading hours. You buy/sell an index fund after the market closes. At the end of the day, an index fund and an ETF will have the same closing price. There is virtually no difference between the two. 

ITOT (77% large, 17% mid cap, 6% small cap) - 3,565 holdings

FXAIX (90% large cap, 10% mid cap, 0% small cap) - 505 holdings

FXAIX tracks the S&amp;P 500 index which consists of 500 largest companies in the US. You will hear performance of S&amp;P 500 mentioned on the news daily because it's considered the best gauge of market performance.  

ITOT tilts heavier toward mid cap and small cap companies. Cap, or capitalization, refers to value of the company. It's calculated by multiplying stock price by number of outstanding shares. Large cap companies have market cap of over $10 billion. Biggest companies in US (Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, for example) have market cap close to $1 trillion. Those are you giant/mega caps. Small cap companies have market cap of less than $2 billion. Mid caps are between $2 billion and $10 billion. Why is it important to hold small and mid caps in your portfolio? Historically, small and mid caps have significantly outperformed large caps. Punch in the numbers and see for yourself: https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio

Why do small caps outperform large caps? They have more growth potential. Take a large cap company like Walmart and small cap like Burlington. It's much more likely for Burlington to double its sales from $100 to $200 million than Walmart from $100 to $200 billion, for example (I used random sales numbers). Also, small and mid caps are less traded than large caps. Large caps trade millions of shares per day while small and mid caps might trade in thousands. Since they are less popular, they are more likely to be undervalued. Since 1972, small cap value companies outperformed total US market by an average of around 4% per year. 

What the drawback on small and mid caps? They are much more affected by downturn or slower economy than large caps. Their stock prices are much more volatile. In our case, Burlington will go out of business well before Walmart, for example. 

In a long run, you probably don't want to put all your eggs in FTEC. FSKAX is a total market fund  like ITOT and is far more diversified. But the technology sector has been so hot in the last 10 years. This year alone, FTEC is up close to 20% compared to S&amp;P 500's 12.5% return. Microsoft just hit an all time high two days ago. Apple is up over 3% in the last hour. A huge catalyst for the technology sector will be a trade agreement between US and China. China is a huge market for semiconductors and micro chips. Keep an eye on those news. 

The godfather of indexing and founder of Vanguard, Jack Bogle, recommends a three-fund portfolio (US stocks, international stocks, and bonds). Here is a good read: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio. The consensus on this subreddit is that a person who is 35 years away from retirement shouldn't hold bonds because they are a conservative investment. Regarding international stocks, they have significantly underperformed compared to the US market in the last 10 years. US and European markets seem to move in cycles where one performs better than other for some time and vice versa. Even Vanguard now recommends to allocate a portion of portfolio into international stocks. Reason being is that US market saw a 10 years boom from 2009 to 2018 and is overvalued compared to international markets. I'm 100% in US stocks, but I also didn't have good international index choices when I started contributing to my 401K.

BradleyLemen,"So then this real estate idea you're for, I had an idea for that but I wasn't to sure if it would be the same outcome and what all your saying I was thinking of saving up 10k then try to get a mortgage on a townhouse the ones I'm looking at are about 150k-170k I would move into it of course and my girlfriend would move in as well and we would have 2 more rooms to have I want to rent out at least one but I'm pretty sure doing 3 would be better and then after my girlfriend is finished college I plan on moving away to denver and keeping this townhouse and just renting it out and using the money to of course some for repairs for the house but the rest go towards another property? Do you think it be better to just buy a cheap car 5k less and then save and get a loan for this townhouse? Or is that also out of the question since I'm young? Because I deff want to get into real estate or as I call it usually is landlord life with many properties just right now like I said I NEED a vehicle but just buying one seems better from the comments on here but you deff have me interested in this house buying idea "
BradleyLemen,Hey wanted to ask what do you think of getting a 20k car? Probably around 17k-20k and making a 5k down payment if I get accepted if not then a 10k? I know we talked about buying used but have been looking around and cheaper newer cars and found one but wanted to get another opinion on this route! But if it's still not smart I'll for sure just find something under 10k and buy it 
BradleyLemen,Their are so many programs out their where you can finance things and pay 0 interest and those are the things I'm talking about. Credit cards are so damn confusing to me and honestly I just don't want to use them because I just don't know how and everyone who explains them to me is different so it just makes it worse
BradleyLemen,Not sure if it's the same everywhere but where I live their is a first time home buyer program where you don't have to make a down payment for your first home purchase so I forgot to mention that sorry about that...
BradleyLemen,Isn't building your credit going into debt always? And I've tried getting a used car before they tell me that the banks rather give money for new cars more than a used car... Also that's the issue I don't want something used either I want something thats new and will last me a few years idc about value 5-10 years from now Im caring about if that car is going to be working for me good down the road.. if the Jeep is to much for the car what price range would you recommend? Like I said I don't have bills I have the luxury of living with Mom so I'm trying to also take advantage of that as well 
BradleyLemen,"I'm going to live in it before I move out I'll be sure to afford it of it goes unrented, the repair I don't have 10k but I'll have some of it for repairs until I keep on saving right now its just the pathway I'm trying to be on so that I'm putting money where I need to be so I can be safe and make sure things are taken care of. But yeah I think of that all the time I just want to build my stream of income and I feel that becoming a landlord and having rental property could be a huge help with that "
BradleyLemen,What would be better for your credit? I'm new to the whole credit card and finance things so I was wondering what's better to build your credit? Having a credit card or financing things? Recently I just financed my puppy and it has helped me build my credit a lot and I've also opened a credit card and I keep up with it but I haven't seen my jump in credit besides when it got added to my account... So I'm generally confused on which route would be better from personal use I feel that financing is better for my credit but I also have low experience with this stuff
BradleyLemen,Ah okay I see what you mean also I'm in the US just kinda basing this off my friend that bought a house with this program and he didn't need a down payment on his home so I'm not truly sure on how true this is or not 
BradleyLemen,"5 new cars holy shit... I just want a new car so I can get to work on my own 😅 I just don't see why not make payments on a car is good? You keep saying get a credit card but you had 25 I don't even want one.... I'm already thinking of the real estate option but right now I just need something to get me to work and back instead of mom and I see your 6-8k option in cash but wouldn't it be wiser to even do that 6-8k on a loan? So 1 I'm getting a car 2 payments for credit 3 I don't need to open up more ccs? Plus if all I have to pay for is a car car insurance, little bills, school, this one cc and puppy I'd still have money left over to also save for real estate my payments would probably be $1000 max a month probably not even that more like $600-700 and I still have more left.... I'm trying to pick your side of things so I know better of course but I'm just looking at getting a car to help me get to work and be a credit builder... I get the cc path but I don't buy things often to get a cc besides food that's where most of my money ever goes to is just going out to eat but I'm already getting a cc for that don't get frustrated either please I'm just trying to understand fully and also give you my pov of things "
BradleyLemen,My biggest thing is utilization like using 30% of the card I'm told it matters I'm told it doesn't matter like which is it..... I have a $300 spending limit on the one I have now and I was going to use it to pay for my bills only but if I am supposed to use 30% only then that's never going to work
BradleyLemen,But the reason I want to buy this townhouse is mainly for my future this property could be a investment and bring me in $1000+ a month very easily I do plan on moving but I also plan on atleast buying a property before I fully leave because I want my monthly income to be a lot of course 
EpikChoices,"Debt collection! 

Original Creditors do not fall under the FDCPA, in general, unless the company uses a different name in its attempt to collect the debt, implying a third party is collecting the debt. 

For additional information: even if this was a debt collection agency, their failure to validate the debt within 30 days does NOT invalidate the debt and relieve you of responsibility. It would just mean the debt collection company violated the FDCPA. If they continued trying to collect within those 30 days, that also is a violation. However to get any recompense for their violations, you must then sue the debt collection company and prove they violated the FDCPA. 

You making money there has nothing to do with whether you should pay the debt. If you were not employed during the time the charges were made, send proof to them of your termination or date of last employment. I’m assuming you didn’t sign anything like a lease for the desk? Where even if you quit you are responsible for x amount of months for the desk? I doubt they would take you to court for $300, but if you can prove you didn’t work there during that time then it shouldn’t be a problem. "
EpikChoices,"Verbal offers mean nothing really. If you have it in writing and abide by any written terms they will stay available I would suppose. 

In a situation where the original credit has ‘assigned’ the debt to be collected, I would contact the original creditor and work it out with them. If they actually ‘sold’ the debt, then you wouldn’t. Sounds like they have just assigned it to a collection agency. 

Who’s to say they really assigned it though? You could end up paying that collection agency just to have the original creditor still come knocking. (I had 3 different collection agencies contact me for the same debt)"
EpikChoices,That’s the point... don’t just get paid on some ADP card because there is no walk in branch. The logical question is ... if my card gets compromised how do I get access to my money. You can’t with the ADP card until a new one is sent or the problem is fixed. 
EpikChoices,"Gap coverage is only worth it if you don’t put a big down payment down and you stick to the payments for the entire loan. 

With your decent downpayment and decision to pay quite a bit more on the monthly payments Gap isn’t really necessary. It’s all in calculating what will be the value of the car if you get in an accident vs what is remaining on the loan. Higher downpayment and paying above the quoted monthly payments will mean you won’t have a gap. 

Being you bought a used car, the depreciation hit it already before you bought it. I agree with people that either you still overpaid or the insurance low balled you. Negotiate everything. Make sure the payoff amount they quote you is actually equal to the value of your car by doing your own research. "
EpikChoices,"If you will get $3k out of $5k of spend requirement just from the trip, you don’t think you can find $2k more in your normal spending over the course of the 3 months? If not find a different card that you can reach to get the bonus. "
EpikChoices,"They seriously have no choice for email notification? My email got slammed when my mortgage was sold. In addition, all auto payments were continued with the new company. 

Have someone/friend/family check your mail for you and let them know to look for important things when you are gone. It’s not your mortgage/Chase’s fault you were out of town for extended periods. 

However, yea they shouldn’t hold it against you due to the grace period. Throw a fit and don’t give in! 

"
EpikChoices,"If an emergency comes, and you have to use the secured card for, let’s say $800, and you can’t pay the secured CC off after the next statement date, do you get hit with an interest charge on the balance? "
EpikChoices,"I think your only option is to take it out and keep it hidden. If you talk to them they might go take more out or clean you out and say well I paid for ‘x, y, and z’ when you were 3-5 ... or ‘rent’ etc. "
EpikChoices,Utilize your company 401k if you have it. Then you don’t even see the money in your account that goes to 401k. Also auto transfer money to a savings account that isn’t tied to your bank on payday so the money is not there in your face.  
EpikChoices,"It seems your take home pay is about $2400? Is this after contributing to a retirement account? Do you have a maintenance budget for your car?

I don’t think you should spend $1200 on an apartment with $2400 take home, regardless of your answers to those questions. 

If you still want to go forward with it, consider spending a couple months pretending you are in an apartment and put away $1200 out of your money into savings your ‘rent’ payment and see how you do over a couple months. "
EpikChoices,"The problem is with the mindset of people with credit cards. They fall into mental traps...

“A $1,000 credit card means I can go buy that new TV and just pay $25 a month on it!” Some people might reason and say “When I get my paychecks I’ll just pay extra.” (Sure, sure you will young grasshoppa) 

By the time the next paycheck arrives, you have a maxed credit card and now need groceries, maybe a doctor visit, cell phone bill is due, oops late fees on rent... paycheck gone. Ok next paycheck I’ll pay it. Oops friends wanted to go out to a movie or bar, well I have cash in my bank account so I can afford it. Oh snap, car insurance is due, electricity due... next paycheck will be the one! And now you have interest on your credit card because you didn’t pay it all off. 

Some people have good intentions, but unexpected things happen and they can’t pay it off. 

It sounds like you are already cognizant of being responsible with a CC so you shouldn’t have a problem. Just don’t treat them as ‘extra’ money. "
EpikChoices,"Mentioning your brother is not in a position to help you financially... even if he was, he shouldn’t. 

Most people suddenly have clarity when they are down in a pit, until they get out of that pit by someone bailing them out. When drug and gambling addicts run out of money and are in a pile of debt, they run to family with their hardship stories looking for sympathy and how they realize how bad things have gotten. Of course, family wants to see the best in each other initially and might bail the person out. How often does this really fix the problem? 

Dig yourself out of your own hole and you’ll appreciate the end result way more.  Besides ‘stopping’ what you are doing, what are you doing to treat the problems that got you there? If you have done drugs and gambling to the point of getting in over your head in debt, you are addicted. Go to the meetings. Go to grief counseling. Cut up any and all credit cards. Look for a better job or try to get more hours at your job. Look for side jobs. Keeping yourself busy gives you more money and less time for other activities. "
EpikChoices,"Minus the car loan, you got into that debt because of poor spending habits more than likely. Was it a good decision to pay it all off? I would say yes, as long as your spending habits have changed. Paying it off is one thing, keeping it that way will be the key. 

How did you get that much CC debt AND build up that much in a savings account? The money to purchase the things you used the CC’s for was there, just being put into a savings account instead of being used. 

Can you sustain your monthly obligations while paying your CC off in full and putting money away in savings? If you aren’t sure, time to check your budgeting. "
EpikChoices,"The general assumption is an IRA or Roth IRA will have better fund options than your 401k. So you go up to the match to get as much free money from employer as you can, then open one of the IRAs with Fidelity, Vanguard, Etc and contribute the remaining amount of retirement there, until you max that out. Then if you want to save more you can up 401k more. 

If you don’t plan on using an IRA then definitely bump up your 401k contribution to whatever you can afford. "
EpikChoices,"Moving to your parents house doesn’t save you THAT much. If you don’t change your habits, you will just have an extra 200 to spend on going out and partying. 

I would suggest an online savings account *that doesn’t have an app*. Then you have to actually log in on a website to see your balance. This has deterred me from logging in and I’m pretty sure I forgot my password for it so just to get in I’m going to have to go through the ‘forgot password’ ordeal which just pushed me off from even trying to log in. Set up weekly/monthly transfers to that account on the days you deposit money into your regular account so as soon as the money is in, some of it is gone to that account and out of your sight. "
EpikChoices,"The debt might be valid... however they must prove you not only that the debt is valid, but also that you now owe THEM the debt. 

People sometimes get contacted by multiple debt collection agencies over the same debt. You aren’t going to pay all of them for the same debt! You need to find out who actually owns the debt still. 

As has been said, send a debt validation letter, certified mail. No validation, no debt owed... to them at least. "
EpikChoices,I would definitely focus on paying off a few student loans to minimize your monthly exposure in case of pay cut. Pay minimum only on the lowest interest rates and put all extra to the highest. Once you find your minimum monthly payments are down you could prob then find a job that is better for your mental health. 
OneWizardsPlease,Please consider that with those loan terms you will most likely end up upside down on that car which will make refinancing difficult. With that in mind what are your plans if that vehicle starts having major mechanical issues? Also have you looked into the cost of full coverage on the financed car? It will most likely be more expensive. Either take that 4k and and fix your Acura or find a used car for 4k. That loan will lead you to more financial troubles down the road.
geaux718,"Should I buy into my state pension? I'm trying to figure out if I should buy into my state pension.

I am 30 years old. At age 55 with 25 years of service, I could retire and receive 57.5% of my highest annual salary every year for the rest of my life. Every additional year I work yields an additional 2.5% of my highest annual salary. I would have to retire at age 72 after 42 years of service to get 100%, which is unlikely to happen since this is a very physically demanding job. However, I have the opportunity to buy into my pension plan. I can buy into it at any time, but the cost is based on current salary, so since my salary will only increase each year, the cheapest time to buy is now. My expected salary at 55 should be about $100,000/year. I can buy up to 5 years for a total of $50,000 right now. If I wait another year, it will increase to $62,000. So does it make more sense to just flat out buy those 5 years now? Or should I pay off the auto loan and more of my mortgage? Or buy only a few years instead of the full 5 and also pay off some of the debt?

Current numbers:

\-Salary: $50k/year

\-VA disability: $14,500/year (not taxed)

\-$65k in savings (earning 2.45% APY)

\-$5k in checking

\-No 401k or other investments

\-$220k mortgage (3.75%)

\-$20k auto loan (2.94%)

\-No other debt"
geaux718,"Not sure where you are located, but a single vending machine can cost around $3,000, so the start-up costs can be enormous. Additionally, vending machines are typically supplied and serviced by a contracted company. It could be considered a conflict of interest to award a vending machine contract to a student. Having to maintain, restock, and being liable for malfunctions or lost money... I just don't think this is a wise or feasible way to generate passive income."
geaux718,"It may be reported as suspicious activity by your bank to the federal government. If it comes from a legitimate source, there's no real issue. However, a report as suspicious activity may cause your bank to hold on to it longer than normal before it can be transferred."
geaux718,"Every year I buy entitles me to an additional 2.5% of my pension payout upon retirement. Five years would be an additional $12,500 per year in retirement. It means I could retire sooner at a higher percentage of my annual salary as my pension. I spent five years in the military, so I am just converting those years into pension years. It's just way more expensive than buying into federal service. 

If I leave in 10 years, at age 50 I would begin collecting about 14% of my highest annual salary during that 10 years, which I'd estimate to be about $13,000/year total for the rest of my life. 

There's no loans available for this type of service purchase. They are fairly strict about what financial resources can be used for this. It has to be an existing 401(a), 401(k), or bank account (not sourced from a loan). 

The VA payment is mine. My spouse brings in about $75k/year and has $35k in a 401(k) with no additional debt. "
wovey,"If its irregular I would probably leave bars in the Dining group.  My husband is a member of a craft beer group that meets every week where he buys a couple of growlers.  For us, it's a regular expense and makes sense to have it's own line."
wovey,"If your entire income is going towards childcare, I would gratefully take up the rent free offer, take care of the baby, and use the evenings to work towards a certificate or degree that will increase your earning potential, or start freelancing selling artwork from home if you are crafty.  Then when you're ready to rejoin the workforce you can  say that you took time off to further your education or work on personal projects."
wovey,"Wowza that's expensive.  I would definitely take the time to raise your kid until school age.  As long as future employers can see that you're working on your education or working at making income and/or art, it should be fine to when you're ready to work again.  As long as you can spin it that you were working hard and not lounging around on the sofa all day, you'll be fine.  Plus who knows, maybe your personal project will take off and can become your full time job."
wovey,Bad idea.  2800 is the minimum you'll pay each month.  Keep in mind when you're a homeowner if something breaks you pay to fix it.  You'll pay maintenance cost to keep everything working.  Some months it may be just air filters while other months it will eventually be a new HVAC or roof.  I would either look for a cheaper place to buy or rent the cheaper place and put the difference into savings to have a good down payment when your income improves
wovey,"Have you tried contacting the manufacturer of the medicines she needs?  My mother's insurance stopped covering one of hers that there's no generic for, and she calls the manufacturer for every refill and they send her a coupon for half price."
wovey,"Get lots of quotes.  We are getting our roof replaced next week and had quotes ranging from $8k to $23k.  You may be able to get the same quality work and materials cheaper if you search around.  Of course check their insurance, warranty info, and previous work.  I would definitely pay cash rather than take on debt unless it wipes your emergency cash to nil.  If that's the case I would pay mostly cash and get a new cc with 0% apr for 12 months for a 1-2k buffer. Pay it off asap, and definitely before the intro apr expires.  Otherwise with a loan or HELOC you'll have interest to pay for no reason."
wovey,"Same as undergrad: rice + beans + frozen veggies.  Stay out of restaurants unless it's an extra special treat or somebody else is paying.  Live in the smallest, cheapest space you can find.  Nothing different than if you're trying to tighten the budget at other times."
wovey,"I agree to check with your employer.  They may allow you to come in early or work remotely for part of your shift.  You never know if you don't ask.  Doing both seems like it will definitely be hard, but it won't last forever.  Even if your GPA drops a little, future employers will look more favorably that you held a responsible position and were able to complete school than if you just had with a 0.5 higher GPA.  I would suggest using a little of your savings to get a really good coffee maker, because it will be a long couple of years!  Whatever you decide, I wish you the best!"
wovey,"I wished I knew the smart way to build credit!  In my teens and early 20s I thought I was being smart by not having a credit card, saving money and had no debt.  Saved and paid cash for cars and everything.  Got married, had a kid, went to buy a house and was told that having no credit score was worse than bad credit - shocking to me when I had tried so hard to do the right thing.  We could get manually underwritten but the interest rate would have been ungodly!  My husband and I financially educated ourselves while we rented a couple more years and got some credit to build a history, and it wasn't a huge setback but it was disappointing at the time."
wovey,"If you get the flu and miss a week of work, does it put you at risk of not eating at the end of the month?

There's really no set dollar amount where everyone will be comfortable, but I would make sure you've got enough left over to put a substantial amount into savings"
wovey,"Make sure you have short term goals too, so you're not looking down a tunnel before you see success.  Maybe it would help to have a splurge goal, maybe a spa day, fancy restaurant dinner, or another luxury to treat yourself that you can look forward to.   Start budgeting $5-10 towards your splurge, where it's not so much to detract from your major goals, but gives you a way to reward yourself and keep the motivation going.  Sounds like you're doing a fantastic job!"
wovey,"Not sure if it's the same everywhere, but when I was hourly I had the option of remaining on the clock for travel time or clocking out and having mileage reimbursed.  Because of my pay rate it was better for me to stay on the clock.  Ymmv it may be different by state of local regs. "
suiathon43,Were you on a HDHP prior to this?  There are rules on how much you can contribute if you are starting your plan in the middle of a year.  Look at page 5 [IRS HSA](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p969.pdf) .  It’s dated for 2018 but I expect it is the same for 2019 except for higher contribution max.
suiathon43,"Common advice is - if it's in there for the long-term just forget about it.  Make your annual or biannual re-allocations and let it run.

&amp;#x200B;

I too fear putting money in at its peak, but I'm not able to predict its peak, so I'd rather make monthly contributions and split that risk gradually.  I also have a small cash balance in high yield interest just in case it does tank.   I'll be investing a portion of that if it does drop, but at the moment it is earning 2.2%"
suiathon43,"And if you do reimburse, attach any reimbursed receipts to the 1099-SA you ought to receive from your HSA administrator for tax time. 

I keep a folder with all my HSA receipts and 1099-SA's.  My hope is to begin accumulating this year, i.e. stop reimbursements.  Definitely have a nice emergency fund at the moment though as I never spend more than $1K each year. "
suiathon43,"I’m in the exact same position.  I’d likely get paid more, but work more hours.  Been here 4 years, so it’s hard to jump to a competitor.  I’m going to ask a lot of questions to see if it’s something I could do for at least 2-3 years before possibly shifting gears again and move to a warmer environment. 

Personally, I’d say only go for it if it agrees with your values and improves you as an individual  professionally and as a whole.  Business is business, but it is also real relationships."
suiathon43,"If same HSA administrator, then probably just continued using the same one?  Unless you're with a uncompliant company, you can just choose your own HSA administrator and ask any new employer to contribute there.  Less hassle on you as the employee. "
suiathon43,"I feel like that should be on the nursing home, or a cost of business, for that industry.  They need to do their own due diligence before accepting patients/tenants.   Unless there's a law forcing them to take them, but I'd think the government has funding for that sort of thing."
suiathon43,"No one would take my room, so I bargained that if I took the room I'd get the driveway for parking.  We did 50% shared space and split the remaining 50% by square footage.  My room was a little odd because it has two doors, thus makes less room to work with. 

Tldr: just talk it out and be reasonable.  "
suiathon43,"Sleep with it next to you, slowly caressing it as your eye lids fall into darkness each night.   It will slowly lose value as it ages over the years, passing into the grave for none to see and retaining only that of sentimental treasures.

&amp;#x200B;

Or put into a high yield savings account and let it procreate money babies.  Just as these babies reinvest in their parents, perhaps consider reinvesting in your parents as your net worth grows."
suiathon43,"At this point, I'd say no. But who knows what the future holds.  Like some others said, people have been waiting years for another catastrophic drop.  Now, if that cash suddenly appeared in your account within the past year then Id definitely stick it in a 2% yield account and wait a few more months or start trickling it into an index fund.  Putting it all in at one time seems rather risky.  

I have a small fund growing in my own 2% account, not even $5K yet. If it gets to the 10K mark, I'll probably begin sending a percentage into a low risk fund. "
suiathon43,"Gotta say, as an accountant YNAB looks like a lot of work.  I use QuickBooks for my finances and after a little bit of setup it only takes a few minutes each week to update .  I don’t need to put much work in it if I don’t want to."
suiathon43,"Isn't the greatest risk having a family place an ""undesired"" relative (with little money) into an expensive home whereas they could place them in a cheaper alternative.  

I understand that LTC is expensive, but some options are cheaper than others and some people may not need top level care.  LTC facilities should also be searching for ways to decrease their costs."
greensleeves97,"If taking the more conservative option means that you can save enough to contribute more to your children’s college funds or some sort of trust fund for them, I’d say to go conservative. If you don’t need a fancy mansion then there’s no point in getting it; it’ll only be a status symbol for your family. Your kiddos won’t care about living in a really nice house vs a mansion. 

As young adults they should be grateful that you and your spouse thought to save for their college education. Or you can take some of that added savings and give them experiences like trips that they’ll appreciate more in the future, have the ability to do something like taking a gap year, etc. Your kids could take on unpaid internships in their field if necessary and not be constantly worried about finances. As someone whose parents did not save for their education, financial stability really is the best thing you can give your kids when they become adults."
greensleeves97,"Sorry this isn’t financial advice, but if y’all had the flu why would the doctor prescribe antibiotics? Medicine advises now to only prescribe antibiotics when people need them and have a bacterial illness because we’re slowly building up immunity to them. Seems a bit shady, unless the doc thought you might have something else complicating the flu and didn’t tell you."
greensleeves97,"I’d go with C personally. Although the chance of something happening soon and your daughter no longer having you around is low, at least that money would be there for her. Or at least put part of it into a trust and use the rest to pay part of your student loans"
greensleeves97,"I would say no, for a few reasons:
The up-front costs total more than half of your savings; I understand that this is one of your life dreams but going will waste money that you could dearly need for something else. Not to mention the fact that if something happens, say lost luggage or medical expenses not covered by insurance, that the cost will rise. Some time after your trip while you’re still in college or a fresh grad you may find that a couple of thousand dollars would really help in an emergency. $2k in savings really doesn’t go as far as we wish it did.

And not to fear-monger, but with the current political climate of New Zealand I’d give a little time for things to settle before visiting. I feel that it’d be better to save the money so you can be more financially stable after graduation, build a more substantial savings, and then travel. I sincerely hope that you’re able to fulfill this dream one day!! The wait will make it even better when you can travel worry-free about your finances."
greensleeves97,"“You exist because of them”- yeah, so they should be more responsible in taking care of their family. Taking hard-earned money from a child without asking is sad. If OP if a first-gen college student then their parents probably don’t understand just how much college will cost. It is incredibly hard to build up savings while attending college, especially since it sounds like OP isn’t going to get much if any financial support from them. "
greensleeves97,"Oh okay. If the issue is paying it off then, wouldn’t that apply to any credit card company? I personally plan to use one for purchases that I know I can afford to pay off. And thank you for the response :)"
greensleeves97,"A lot of apartments will require you to show paystubs proving that your monthly income is at least 3 times the monthly rent. Try looking at Facebook pages for shared housing, especially if there’s a university in the town you’re moving to.

greensleeves97,"I mentioned in another comment that OP didn’t provide location or major. Admittedly when I first read this my mind jumped to academia, but even so I think that to demand such a high increase relative to their initial (lower end) offer is unwise. Unless OP did many things in graduate school which give them more power to leverage a higher salary straight out of grad school. Excellent performance in program but not Exceedingly distinguished=more conservative decisions after grad. Excellent performance in program with distinguished activities=more room to make demands and take risks. My initial comment was not judgement but rather surprise at wanting such a high salary (again, without knowing area and job market.) Have a great day!"
greensleeves97,"On my 1098-t form this year Box 1: “Payments received for qualified tuition and related

greensleeves97,"That would be a pretty specific situation. OP didn’t mention their degree or area the job is located in. Considering it’s his only job offer he also doesn’t want to be too pushy and risk ruining things. For where OP is at in relation to graduation I’d say the negotiations are at the point where if he demands more when they’ve already raised $15k plus the sign-on bonus, that’s about it. "

Schools have to meet federal guidelines to help students according to the Americans with Disabilities Act, so it is your right to receive some sort of assistance at a U.S. university.

greensleeves97,"I think if you go with your current plan then you need to make it sound like it’s his idea or have him support it somehow. A lot of seniors struggle with the fact that as they age they begin to lose their independence, starting with physical/mental capabilities. You can suggest that it would be easy for someone to steal his debit card so a visa reloadable card is a safer option to carry around. I think that completely cutting him off from his own money without his consent or basically forcing him into it, no matter how right you may feel you are, could make his later years worse and advance mental deterioration. Situations like yours can be difficult to maneuver as I’m sure you already know. Good luck!"

enjaydo,"As other's said, you likely want to keep most of the $5000 as an emergency fund.  This means you don't want any risk, so a money market or high yield checking yielding between 2-3% would be good.  LMCU offers a checking account with 3% interest (with a couple easily met requirements).  

I would consider investing $20 and several hours of your time to read a couple books on finance / investing.  It's pretty simple for the average person.  [Boglehead's Guide to Investing](https://www.amazon.com/Bogleheads-Guide-Investing-Taylor-Larimore/dp/0470067365) is a good one to start with and will teach you about insurance and other topics.  I'm sure the wiki here or Boglehead's wiki would be good if you are interested in others.  

Investing in yourself at this age is very important, as making yourself more valuable and earning a higher income will likely yield the most return.  

If I were to go back, I would have opened a Roth IRA when I was 18 and saved as much of my income as I could (even if it were only $50-100 / month) in total stock market index fund (FSKAX or VTSAX), while keeping a good-sized emergency fund (6 months of expenses).  This may not be right for you though - educate yourself before doing this.  "
enjaydo,"In the us there are no fees for transactions at vanguard.  It's just a yearly fee take out if the fund assets.

I caution against investing in stocks if this is your outlook.  I second the suggestion to read bogleheads guide to investing before doing anything.  If interested in going a little deeper and more technical after this, the four pillars of investing by Bernstein and asset allocation by ferri are good follow ups."
enjaydo,"It sounds like you are starting to take control and get on a solid path forward, good job.

The simplest and best thing I think you could do is roll it over to an IRA at vanguard and invest in their target date fund for your age (either 2045 or 2040).  This is also an aggressive / high-risk investment.  You can lose up to 40% in a year in a crisis like 2008, but if you don't sell it will most likely recover in a couple years.  If you cannot tolerate this risk, pick a fund with a higher bond allocation target retirement 2030, the balanced fund, etc).

Rolling to new employers 401k could be a viable option.  Would need more info (available funds, do they allow rollovers, etc).

You can work on learning more, and update your strategy as you learn more.  The above is the simplest that doesn't require you to know much. It's not a bad long term strategy if you want to keep it simple.

enjaydo,"This is very specific to you, only you will know the answer.  Which will be better for your personal growth and goals?

I am also a software engineer.  I will generalize here from my experience at 6 companies, maybe it's different with these specific companies.  This is how I see it:

* Current employer = low risk, known reward, extra time for hobbies and/or side gigs.
* Startup = higher risk, higher potential for a big payout, likely more stressful, less personal time.  It is likely to be more demanding of you and give you more autonomy.  You will likely grow more professionally, build more skills, and be more challenged.

It sounds like the startup's business is software, so they view engineers as an asset instead of a liability.  The airline views you as a necessary expense they cannot do without, not as a revenue generator.  I personally find working at software businesses much better and more fulfilling than other companies.

If you are looking to grow in your career, challenge yourself, and are fine with a little risk and extra work - I would pick the startup.  It will likely result in more meaningful work/autonomy, gaining more valuable skills, getting paid more at your next job, and potentially large reward.  It could also mean an extra 10+ hours / week that you never get paid for.  I would personally not be too concerned about the risk of the startup.  You are young and should be able to find another job easily.  Just don't burn bridges..

If you are content with your current role and happy collecting a paycheck with less risk and more free time - I would pick the airline.  Companies like this tend to pigeon hole into a very narrow role, with little autonomy, and will take 8 hours to accomplish as much as a startup will in 1 hour.  This can cause some stagnation if you stay too long.  The fact that you were already looking and things have been chaotic leads me to believe this isn't a good choice for you.  Too little too late?

If you don't want to put in long hours and take on the extra risk, you could stay at the airline for now and look for a different opportunity.

Either way, look at payscale / indeed, and see where your pay should be for your experience.  You should go for &gt;80th percentile.

&amp;#x200B;"
enjaydo,"I would focus on investing in yourself.  40k out of high school is good.  You want to continue to increase your earnings potential.  I know a couple software developers/engineers that never went to college and make &gt;100k before they are 25 in the midwest (lower cost of living area).  You can go to a code bootcamp, learn online, etc.  College could also be useful.  Investing in yourself will probably be the best return you can get.

I would also try to max out the roth ira.  You could keep it simple and just invest in a target retirement date fund to start.  This would be money you don't plan to touch until you are near retirement, as it is a high risk investment (you could lose 40% in a year if we have a crash like 2008).  If you plan to touch the money soon, this is not a good option.  

[https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTTSX](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/profile/VTTSX)

This fund would split your investment between \~4000 US stocks, 6000 international stocks, over 10k us bond issues (government and corporate, across credit ratings), and over 5000 international bond issues (government and corporate, across credit ratings).  It's one fund that is more or less as diversified as you can get.

Fidelity has a comparable offering if you want to go with them instead.

Here are some details on target date funds.

[https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Target\_date\_funds](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Target_date_funds)

If you want to save a little on fees, once you have more invested, you can hold the individual funds instead and change to a portfolio like this:

[https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund\_portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)"
enjaydo,"The general idea is to only invest in stocks for the long term.  Long term is usually &gt;15 years.  This is because of the volatility.  Over the long term stocks tend to offer the best return, because they have the most risk.  Over the short term they can lose 40%+ in a year.  If you want to use the money in &lt; 10 years, it's possible the value may be down when you go to withdraw and you don't want to sell stocks in a down market (as they usually recover in a couple years).

Bonds have historically given less return, as they are less risky.  They are generally better suited for a short to medium term horizon.  It would be very unusual for the value of the portfolio to be less when you go to withdraw.

You will likely want to hold some bonds and some stocks.  The ratio is up to you.  Base it on your tolerance for risk, the time-frame, and how stable you need the portfolio to be.  If I were in your shoes, I would probably keep an emergency fund of around $2,000-$5,000 in a money market or high-yield checking account (you can earn between 2-3%). I would consider one of the  [LifeStrategy](https://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/lifestrategy/#/mini/overview/0724) funds from vanguard for the rest.  They have $3,000 minimum (if you don't have this much, there are other options.  Fidelity index funds don't have a minimum, so you could just by the underlying index funds at a similar allocation).  Since you may want to use this money after college, I would probably go with conservative growth.  Once you have a job, a good emergency fund, and are ready to invest on a longer term, I would go up to 80-90% stocks.  If you are in the US, a Roth IRA would be a good account for the investments if you have income.

I would suggest finishing the bogleheads book before you take any action, so you are more informed and can make this decision for yourself.  What I would do, may not be exactly what you want (maybe you want more or less risk, etc).

&amp;#x200B;"
enjaydo,"It depends on your goals.  I like being debt-free, so I would probably just put it towards the mortgage - 4.125% isn't a bad after-tax return.

If you want to try and get a better long-term return, you could invest it.  If it's in a tax advantaged account, you may come out ahead of the 4.125%.  It's a bit of a gamble.

You could also do both."
enjaydo,"As ilumineer suggested, I would go with the  [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio)  across all of your accounts.

The % of each fund would be dictated by your  [Risk Tolerance](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Risk_tolerance) .  The last thing you want to do is take on more risk than you can handle and end up selling stocks in panic during a bad year.  You can go pretty aggressive or conservative based on your risk tolerance (or somewhere in between.  Examples could be:

Aggressive (ie: be prepared to potentially see your balance drop 40%+ in a bad year): 90% stocks, 10% bonds

Conservative: 60% stocks, 40% bonds.

Then decide if you want international stock exposure.  Some go 0% since they like investing at home and us companies have global exposure, some all the way up to 50% international since the US could end up going through something like Japan with three decades of no growth.  Divide your stocks up accordingly.

Once you arrive at your allocation, set your contributions to match it.  You want to maintain this allocation across your different accounts (roth, 401k, ..), and  [rebalance](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Rebalancing)  to the allocation once per year (say on jan 1, or w/e date you prefer) (sell winners to buy more of the losers, ie: if your target is 70% stocks but you have 75% bc stocks went up, trade some of the stocks to buy more bonds).

Some of the funds in this 401k have higher expenses than they should, but you can construct a three-fund portfolio with:

Fidelity 500 index fund (us stock)

Schwab Intl Lg Co Idx (int stock)

TIAA-CREF Bond (bond)

While most three-fund portfolios would use ""total market"" funds that give a little exposure to smaller companies  and emerging markets, these large cap index funds are ""good enough"" imo considering your options.  You can always add Vanguard small cap index to your us stock portion (say 10% of your us stock allocation) and Fidelity Emerging Market Idx to your international stock (say 20% of your international allocation), if you feel inclined to diversify a little more.

Two examples for a 80% stock (70% us, 30% international), 20% bond allocation:

1. 56% Fidelity 500, 24% schwab international, 20% TIAA-CREF bond
2. 51% Fidelity 500, 5% vanguard small cap, 19% schwab international, 5% Fidelity Emerging Market, 20% TIAA-CREF

\#2 is slightly more diversified.  Adjust to your preferences, tolerance for risk, and other accounts."
enjaydo,"How much are you looking to spend on a car?

I would consider getting a car for around 1.5-3k (used mazda, honda, toyota).  You will be able to get a much better deal than from a dealership or used car lot.

* Save enough to buy in cash (you should be able to save this in &lt;3-6 months?). You can usually junk a car for 500-800.  Then you just need to save the difference.  This would be the best option.
* If you cannot wait until then and have good enough credit to pull this off... you could consider using a credit card cash advance to buy a car from a private party (craiglist, etc) and then transfer that balance to another 0% credit card with no or very low transfer fee.  You would probably want to sign up for this 0% card first and get it lined up to ensure you can transfer and not pay high interest on the original card.  This podcast speaks about this approach (minutes 17-25 are most relevant): [https://www.radicalpersonalfinance.com/blog/585-credit-cards-are-an-incredible-tool-an-introduction](https://www.radicalpersonalfinance.com/blog/585-credit-cards-are-an-incredible-tool-an-introduction).  I would recommend the first approach, but this might be the best way to do it if in a dire situation.

enjaydo,"This fund is used for achieving a ""small value tilt"" (google it if you aren't familiar).  Fama and French created a  [three factor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fama%E2%80%93French_three-factor_model) that this type of fund is built on.  Small + value companies should have more risk and theoretically have higher return.  However, nothing is guaranteed.  There are a lot of people chasing this extra return, which may cause it to disappear?  I personally don't tilt my portfolio, but don't see anything wrong with going for it if you are aware of the purpose / theory / risks.   "
enjaydo,"I would personally consider a high-yield checking account, such as LMCU's that yields 3%.  You do have to make 10 debit card purchases each month to get 3% (easy to do with netflix, lunch, parking meters, etc..).  You would only need one account and it's all accessible since it's just a checking account.

I question the value of using chase for banking, as they aren't competitive at all in this area.  Why give them your banking business when they don't give you anything in return, and another bank will?  They have great credit cards, but you can easily pay these automatically from another bank.  You just put the other bank's routing # and your account # in for your chase card, and chase will pull your payment from your other bank.  You could just move it all to Ally if the high-yield checking isn't something you want to deal with."
enjaydo,"I don't see how you can reasonably afford a car if you cannot save more than $100-200 / month without one.  On the LOW end, you are looking at operating expenses for a car being roughly $200 / month ($50 insurance, $50 gas, $100 maintenance), once the car is paid for.

I definitely wouldn't use credit to get a car in your situation, unless not having a car is preventing you from earning more money.

I'd focus on investing your time and the $100-200 / month in yourself to earn more money.  Get skills that will allow you to earn more."
enjaydo,"If she wants to climb out of this hole, she needs to stop spending as much money.  You should give more details on her budget, so people can advise on ways to cut other costs and put it towards the debt.

enjaydo,"Your interest on the 6k @ 25% is around $125 / month.  I would pay this asap.  Pay 500+ a month towards it and you should be done in less than a year.

I do not think it is wise to own three cars for two people.  Why do you want the truck, and what gas mileage does it get?  

It sounds like you are currently commuting around 1200 miles.  At 20mpg this is $150 / month in gas.  If you get a car that gets 40, this would cut it to $75.  I would consider going to one car (maybe the truck) while paying off the credit cards and ""other people.""  A more optimal approach would probably be selling both of your cars for a used toyota corolla, honda civic, or prius. "
enjaydo,"Here are my thoughts/questions:

1. Emergency fund: I would use a minimum of 5k here and put it in something like the capital one money market or LMCU max checking.  This rule of 3-6 months works better for people with higher monthly expenses.
2. What do you mean by ""Investing all of it in a taxable account seems risky and foolish.""  The type of account doesn't impact the level of risk of the investment.  It may be more optimal to use a tax-advantaged account, but not sure where the perception of risk comes into play.  If you are weary of risk before investing, I would reconsider your tolerance for a portfolio consisting of 85% stocks.  We are near an all-time high in the stock market and bonds have been on a 30+ year bull run (which is just starting to cool and correct a little).  How would you feel if you deploy this into an 85/15 portfolio and lose 25k in the next year?  If you are planning to use this money for a house in the near future (6 years is pretty ""near"" in finance), I would use a more conservative portfolio.
3. Why a robo-adviser?   You seem interested enough in the basics to be able to manage a 3-fund portfolio yourself.
4. Do you have health insurance?  An HSA  would be another tax-advantaged vehicle you could take advantage of.
5. Can you supply the funds available in your 401k?

As it stands you are in a great situation, with extremely low expenses and the ability to save &gt;90% of your income.  I would be sure to understand and come to terms with your tolerance for risk."
enjaydo,"If buying the car is a must (your guilty pleasure, ...) I would save every penny you can in a money market (earning \~2-2.4% right now) and buy it in cash when you have enough + 6 months of expenses.  This way you avoid paying high interest on it.  

Let's say you can negotiate or get one for around 30k and get 2k for your current car.  

Target:  12k savings, 30k new car, -2k current car = 40k

Current: 10k

If you save 2k / month, 15 months."
enjaydo,"Get quotes from different dealers and tell them you are shopping around for the best deal.  Do not divulge what the best deal you have so far is, as they will barely go under it.  Let them play their hand before you play yours.  You can then try negotiating a bit more with the best one.  

I just bought a new prius for 3k under MSRP using this approach.  I was lazy and only shopped 3 dealers, but felt the 3rd was giving me a good enough deal.  There are many ways dealers can make more money on cars and a lot of times they can get rebates for themselves (regional dealership incentives, corporate incentives, etc).  High-volume dealers are more likely to cut better deals as they get better pricing and incentives for their inventory."
enjaydo,"I recommend googling ""Boglehead's Guide to Investing PDF"" and reading this book.  It covers stocks and bonds on page 26.

enjaydo,"Wait.

You don't even have a concrete way to pay the loan back (no job, there is no ignoring this part of the situation imo).

You should practice the habit of only spending money you have.  Especially for items that aren't absolutely necessary.  This adds unnecessary risk to your life (ie: you become sick and cannot work, economic problems where you lose your job, ...).

You can build credit by only buying goods you have the money for on a credit card, and paying the balance each month."
enjaydo,"If you contribute 19k to a 401k and/or 3.5k to an HSA, it reduces your income that is used for calculating the limit.

Make sure you learn about the backdoor before executing it.  Doing this properly can be somewhat complex, depending on your scenario.  Planning so you can continue to do this in the future as additional changes in your situation and income occur is complex.  If you have other IRAs (traditional, simple, ...), you will run into the pro-rata rule.  You would not be able to rollover 401ks into an IRA as you leave jobs without running into pro-rata.  You can plan around this, but this is where the complexity of the financial planning starts increasing.  Some people have a small side business and can establish a solo 401k plan.  They can rollover their old 401ks and non-roth IRAs into it.

If you start down this path, research asset protection planning.  Certain account types are protected from bankruptcy (depending on your state) in case you end up getting wrongfully sued/etc.  Solo 401k plans are not as well protected as many other accounts.

I would just make sure you don't go into this thinking it's simple/easy and get nailed with a big tax bill, expose more of your wealth to creditors, etc..

enjaydo,"I would suggest starting to build your credit.  You can research this in more detail, but there are few main criteria for the score: % on time payment, average length accounts have been open, % of credit used, # inquiries in past 24 months, new accounts, available credit.  If you open one or two cards and use for your monthly payments (phone, etc) and pay in full each month, it will help with several of these factors and build your credit.

Your budget and situation looks good.  I would consider contributing 5500 to roth ira.

One thing I find a bit contradictory is buying a house and wanting to have money liquid for relocating for a better job opportunity.  Selling a house typically costs about 8% of the home's value (6% to realtor and transfer taxes).  I would not buy something if you want to remain flexible in this way, unless you really value having your own place.  Renting at 1000 / month is a good deal IMO.  "

I agree with the others.  If I were her, I would pay off her debt and invest the rest.  You two should learn to budget, build your credit, better manage your finances, and save the 50k down payment from your income.  You wont get a reasonable loan with those credit scores, and you shouldn't be taking on a 275k home loan if you cannot manage your finances and credit well enough to have better scores.  275k is pushing the limits on your income."

I think having 2 years of expenses in an emergency fund savings account is a little excessive. I would cut it to 1 year and place the rest in some kind of investment vehicle so you can earn more than paltry savings account interest on that potentially sizable sum.

When you say you are putting 25% of your net paycheck to savings, do you mean into just a bank savings account or do you mean an IRA/taxable brokerage account?

Given that you seem to be saving enough already otherwise, putting this money towards a home downpayment can be perfectly fine."

OP - use this as your guide if you are not otherwise working with a professional.

U.S. citizens are ""taxed"" on all worldwide income, so you always need to file a tax return even if you were abroad the entire year. (Edit: subject to some minimum income requirements, which if you roughly made more than $12k you'll need to file).

Given your income, however, you won't owe any taxes because of the foreign earned income exclusion. You still need to file though noting that deduction."
kolkena,"I'm going to really disagree with the poster above. He seems to be saying if you don't have the full cash on hand for this expense, you can't afford it. I think that's way too much of a debt adverse mindset to have, especially if you otherwise have over half a million in actively invested capital and clearly have the means (if need be) to eliminate the debt.

Debt is fine (and even beneficial) if you use it appropriately. Spending all $80k in cash is not as optimal vs. spending $20k in cash and financing the rest at a low enough interest rate while otherwise investing rest of the $60k you otherwise would have spent.

7% personal loan is too high of an interest rate, and I would recommend not selling RSUs for a home improvement project (you still have to pay taxes on these when you sell).

If you are able to find a HELOC or other financing with interest rates of 4-4.5% or below, I think that would be a fine way to finance the project. Even better if you have the income stream to pay off quicker than the term without otherwise affecting retirement savings.

kolkena,"&gt; car was worth 2600-3400 usd 

A car's value does not include the cost of inspections, plate renewals, drivers license renewal etc. Your car was probably ""worth"" around 2500-3000.

&gt; how much would Nationwide insurance give me for the car 

Nationwide will cut you a check quickly for the value of the car they determine (probably like 2.5-3k) minus your insurance deductible. They will send out an adjuster to actually make this determination. 

If you don't know your deductible ask your dad, he probably set up your insurance. If you are officially deemed ""not at fault"" for your accident (which seems to be the case if police agree), Nationwide will then send you a separate check later on for your deductible amount so you will get the full ""value"" of your car. Note that the second deductible check can take awhile to come, maybe 30-60 days.

It is up to you then to go out and use the insurance money they give you to buy another car. Don't buy a used car that needs immediate repairs to make road safe."
kolkena,"&gt; My income has increased substantially from $24k/yearly to $65k/yearly in the last 2 years 

This makes sense on your payments then, thanks for adding.

Are you married / are you sole individual on the deed or is shared with spouse/others?

kolkena,"Earning 0% is effectively losing money in an economy with inflation.

kolkena,"Total Balance = entire amount of money on the card right now

Statement Balance = amount of money you spent in the previous statement period (e.g. last month's balances)

Closing Date = day that ends the current statement period so they generate your next month's statement balance payment

In practice, ignore your total balance and ignore your closing date. Pay your statement balance in full by the due date each month in order to avoid any interest charges. 

The reason to wait until after the closing date to pay off your statement balance is that having statement balances can be a good thing if you are looking to increase your credit score. 1-10% utilization rate (your total balances / your total credit limits) is a good score increaser,  but 0% isn't as good (banks like to see you use credit, not just have a limit and never use it).

If you have unusually high balances some months and don't want that large amount to go on your statement (and thus give you a higher utilization rate, potentially lowering CC score), then pay off anything you don't want to show up on your next statement before the closing date.

kolkena,"Entirely depends on interest rates, risk, term of loan, type of asset (e.g. car vs. house), and whether its personal or business debt. In general, debt above \~4%+ I'd argue its better to pay off in full immediately.

If you are buying a house and can get a sub 4% interest rate, I'd argue that 0% down-payment is optimal (ignoring PMI for the moment). In a perfect world, the money you would have otherwise used for a down-payment could be invested in the market and over 30 years it would out-earn the higher interest you paid with no down payment plus the eventual equity from appreciation. 

Obviously, this world isn't perfect. Home prices don't always go up (hello 2008) and a 0% downpayment can mean you are underwater very quickly if markets have a downturn, so some down-payment is advised just for risk reasons (and few to no lenders will approve 0% loans).

Many people in this sub argue against debt as a personal finance tool because it is hard to use it appropriately. You have to be aware of how unexpected events can influence your debt payment cash flows and have to be actively involved in pushing money towards higher earning investments (e.g. so requires some market knowledge)."
kolkena,"\*Not a professional opinion in any way\*

So (correct me if I'm wrong) timeline is:

1. Buy crypto in non-U.S. country
2. Move to U.S. as student intending to stay for more than 1 year
3. Sell crypto in a calendar year in which you happened to spend less than 183 days in the U.S.
4. Keep staying in the U.S. for studies
5. Leave U.S. after studies finished

I would read the IRS rulings that if you actually stayed for less than 183 days in the calendar year in which you had capital gains (even if the previous and following years you did stay for more than 183 days) you would not owe any U.S. taxes on that amount.

To be sure, this would now be a factual question and were you to be audited or questioned by the IRS, you would need to show documented travel proving the amount of time you stayed in the U.S. during that particular year."
kolkena,"I would normally say just have \~6 months of emergency expenses in the account and put rest into investments.

If you are probably going to be buying a house within the next 1-2 years, keep the amount of downpayment + expenses you'd expect still in that Ally account. 2.2% is pretty good yield for that liquidity.

You should (ideally) have 6 months of emergency expenses + the down payment/closing costs amounts in that Ally account.

The idea behind keeping the down payment money in Ally vs. investing is that while investing has the potentially for much higher returns and on ""average"" returns \~7-8%/year, if we face a downturn, 1-2 years may not be enough to recover your account value (with the guaranteed 2.2% on top of that as well)."

&gt;In general, under the ""tax home"" rules, a person who is away (or who intends to be away) from his tax home for longer than 1 year has shifted tax homes to his new location upon his arrival in that new location

If you stayed less than 183 days in the U.S. your tax home would not shift to the U.S., thus any typically U.S. sourced capital gains would be treated as foreign-sourced and not U.S. taxable (it would still be subject to taxation, if any, of your home country).

&gt;If you were in the United States for less than 183 days during the tax year, capital gains (other than gains listed earlier) are tax exempt unless they are effectively connected with a trade or business in the United States during your tax year.

The ""gains listed earlier"" refer to (none of which apply to you in your situation):

kolkena,"&gt; I am enrolled in an income driven payment plan 

I'm assuming you know about all of the usual warnings around IBR/PAYE loan plans (massive tax bomb implications upon forgiveness, etc.).

How significant will your salary increase be? I know from personal experience that your loan amounts will require around $1800-2000 minimum/month to pay off under a typical 10 year plan. Can you afford that amount with your salary increase? 

If yes, choose increasing your student loan payments. The 6.25% interest is very high and having the ability to pay off within \~10ish years will literally save you \~$100k+ in interest and later tax obligations.

If no, honestly I'd stick with IBR/PAYE (pray you make much more in 20-25 years to mitigate the tax bomb) and contribute to your Roth IRA. Tax-free growth while you are young is important and at least contributing something, even if not maxing out the Roth IRA, will help with compounding interest.

Beyond tax issues, just place the funds in a high yield savings account (Ally, CITI, etc.) that have yields of 2.2%+, or another short term CD if their rates are comparable (I haven't checked recently). Don't bother investing that money in any equity markets in that short of time frame and if you actually need that money to purchase a house when you come back."

kolkena,"&gt; However, any time I bring this up to my parents, they tell me that I shouldn't ""rush into it"". And that I can negotiate a student loan forgiveness package with my future employer. 

The only employers I know who pay for any sort of education are typically consulting/other business firms who have current employees who are leaving to get their MBAs. Those employees are then typically obligated to return to that employer for a number of years. It's very unlikely you would get any package unless you have a pre-arranged option before you entered school.

&gt; ""wait until after you're done with school"" mentality or confirm that trying to pay off my loans while in school is an okay move. 

Your student loans accrue interest even if they are not currently any payments ""due"". It's in your financial interest to pay off any amount you can sooner as you save money in interest in the long term.

Example: you have $30,000 of undergraduate debt at \~4% interest. While you are in your masters program, you do not have to many any payments on those loans. However, they will still accrue interest. If you haven't made any early payments during your two-year masters program, once your payments start becoming due after your masters you will owe $32,448 instead of the $30,000 you originally took out.

In particular it is in your interest to pay off graduate student loan debt quickly as graduate student loans typically are at much higher interest rates than undergraduate student loan debt (2-3% vs. 5-6%)."

 Just do VTSAX (or VOO if you don't meet minimum), VBTLX (or BND if you don't meet minimum) and VTIAX (or VXUS if you don't meet minmum, with percentages varying based upon your age and risk tolerances.

&gt;travel money to make several 2 to 3 day trips to NY over that time period for job interviews and to look for houses (+/- $3000?)

Sure, but don't waste money traveling for initial interviews. Wait until you've done some phone/video initial interviews so the travel has increased chance of getting the job.

&gt;I'll need to save for a down payment on a house, which would be my first home purchase so I'm hoping I'd get that ""first time buyers"" credit where I'd only have to pay 3% down

No. You will not be able to afford purchasing a home/condo/apartment anywhere near NYC on a &lt;$50,000 income. You are completely underestimating the cost of living increase in NYC here. You'll need to rent, and most landlords will require you to show **40-45x your monthly rent in annual income** in order to qualify (without a guarantor). NYC is incredibly expensive. You may need to consider living with roommates if you don't have a significant salary increase.

If you would like to purchase a home (outside the city, like upstate or in NJ) later on, follow this sub's guidance on savings first (emergency fund of 3-6 months of expenses, retirement savings, etc.) before you think about buying a house.

&gt;I'm hoping the same job I have now (Inventory control in distribution) would pay more over there? Living in the city would be preferable, but at the most, I would want to live no more than an hour away.

You would need a very significant salary increase to justify the move, otherwise you would be effectively making less money given the cost of living differences."

OP - common logic of asset management is that once in retirement your portfolio should be heavily balanced towards bonds/fixed income that intentionally produces lower rates of returns in exchange for limited risk.

You shouldn't even be thinking about aggressively investing your parents portfolio when they don't have time to make any recoveries that younger people have.

kolkena,"&gt; Essentially the owner is saving \~$14000 per year whereas I receive $0 compensation for space or utilities. 

&amp;#x200B;

The owner is not under any obligation to pass on work-related savings onto you, and most employers I have encountered or heard about do not compensate employees in any way for home office utilities or ""space"" (e.g. space taken out of home for office activities). If you are primarily working from home, I know some employers often pay for equipment on the employees behalf, think monitors, keyboards, printers, cost of software, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

With all of that said, the angle you should take is about competitive salaries of others in your area with similar obligations. Getting a dollar/hr raise over three years isn't even keeping up with inflation. I think it's perfectly reasonable to ask for a raise on that basis, along with other competitive salaries if this is functionally a full-time job for you.

&amp;#x200B;

You should be aware though that if you resign, you aren't likely to find an opportunity with the same work from home ability, thus probably raising your childcare costs if those were being offset by you being at home primarily.

kolkena,"I feel like something doesn't add up here. $64k at 6.375% should not go to $104k total in 5 years, particularly if you have been making some payments (even not enough to reduce principal). $64k at 6.375% interest would only go to roughly $88-90k in 5 years without any additional payments.

Otherwise, I honestly would think this is an okay option here. Normally I would say no, but factors I'm considering here:

* Replacing 6%+ interest rate debt with \~4% rate (assuming current rates)
* ~~Replacing non-dischargeable debt with dischargeable~~ debt (Edit: saw she has federal student loans)
* Low likelihood of refinancing $100k+ student loan debt to an affordable per month payment on $5500/month income, and income based repayment tax bomb if he continues paying minimums for 20-25 years

Things I'm worried about:

* The 10 year repayment plan for $64k at 6.375% is roughly \~$700-750/month. You said refinancing would add an extra $600 to your monthly payment. Has your income improved substantially over the past \~5 years? If you've been paying $250/month, it only would have taken $500 more from the beginning to pay these off within 10 years vs. $600 more now to refinance. If your income hasn't changed significantly over these 5 years, I'm more worried you have a budgeting problem vs. debt problem."

3.) Do you typically recommend the same fund company/companies to your clients? Why these ones?

legumeshaving,"“I’m so scared to the point if inaction”

Take the money from your CDs (while leaving sufficient cash reserves for an emergency fund) and put them in a brokerage account managed by a robo-advisor. I’d personally recommend Schwab’s Intelligent Portfolio, although there are plenty of other brokerage firms that offer robo to choose from. You answer a risk questionnaire to determine your asset allocation breakdown (and whether you prefer just US vs Global diversification), and Schwab does the rest. They place all of the trades for you and periodically rebalance for you as needed (using % drift as the guideline). There are no trading fees or management/AUM fees. You only pay the underlying fund fees, and because they primarily use their proprietary ETFs, these are very low (~0.15% average).  

The only drawback to this service—aside from having trading control over your account of course—is that their cash allocation is too high. Usually around 8%, although you can answer the questionnaire in such a way to dwindle that down to 4 or 6% by playing around with the different answers. All that said, and going back to your quote that I started with, 8% sitting in cash while the other 92% is broadly diversified across asset classes/sectors/markets is better than sitting at 100% cash. 

Don’t let your hesitation and lack of investing confidence affect your retirement goals more than they already have. The sooner you invest this money appropriately, and the more time you have for compounding returns, the better. Best of luck!"
legumeshaving,"Leave enough cash for 6-12 months living expenses should you lose your job (you might be great, but you never know when an organization is going to “restructure” and cut jobs). Put this in a HYSA—you can get anywhere from 2.2-2.45% out there right now. 

Whatever you have left over: put into a brokerage account and invest. If you don’t know how you should allocate it, I always recommend robo advisors for people in your shoes. Schwab’s is decent—you answer a few questions on your intentions for the account and your tolerance for risk, and they put the money into a set asset allocation model for you. It also rebalances automatically as things rise&amp;fall out of whack. The real downside about their robo platform is how high they allocate cash, so you can just do this to start to get an idea for how you might want to allocate it yourself and then have the robo turned off so you have control over the trading. 

Finally, if you’re finding yourself at an ongoing cash surplus each month and you have extra cash that you’re saving, then you should probably increase how much you’re allocating to the TSP. Prioritize that over the brokerage."
legumeshaving,"I’ll probably get downvoted for this but here’s my serious recommendation. 

Your risk tolerance shouldn’t matter here, you should contribute 100% into equity funds. I say this because I’m assuming you’re young, being that this is your first 401k. The money that you put aside into this account won’t be touched for ~40 years. Therefore the prudent thing to do is to place 100% of your contributions into an allocation that will provide you with the highest likely returns, regardless of your tolerance for risk.      (An aside: Your risk tolerance WOULD matter for any other account, say a Roth IRA. This would be because while typically Roth IRA funds wouldn’t be touched until 59.5 or older, some circumstances like say, a first time home purchase, qualify for “premature” withdrawals. Thus you might look at this account with a more moderate risk tolerance, as you could be needing these funds in the next decade or so and might be less comfortable with dramatic swings in your account balance). 

Now everyone has their own preferred allocation breakdown in terms of value vs growth and large cap vs mid cap vs small cap, but my 401k is allocated like this:

40% Growth equities 

40% Value equities 

20% international equities 

My 401k has total growth/value funds, so I’m not able to break it down by large/mid/small, but I’d maybe breakdown each 40% allocation something like 20% Large   10% Mid   10% Small. 

Again, I say this with the assumption that you’re younger and won’t be needing these funds for 40ish years. Keep in mind that there has never been a 30-year period where the stock market has lost money, so it’s more than likely that a 100% equity portfolio will appreciate over the long term (although historical performance is no guarantee of future results). 

At some point, say maybe your 40s or 50s, you will need to rebalance the account towards something more balanced, where market downturns won’t cause such drastic swings in your account balance, but for now you want as much growth potential as possible. My two cents.

superheroninja,"Expunge bankruptcy from record...wife’s tax accountant has a ‘service’. DIY? Hi all,

So as the title says my wife has been using a tax accountant who is actually the treasurer of a district in Los Angeles., CA. He says he has an almost surefire method of removing BK from one’s personal credit history, but I’m wondering if there are any equally surefire ways to do it on your own? 

He is wanting to charge her a flat rate fee to initiate his service of 180 and 6 subsequent payments of ~90...just seems a little strange to me, but then again I don’t know anything about the process. 

Many thanks! 

"
superheroninja,"Would it matter that her waiting period is basically over (7 years)? I know you can get certain past records expunged from your personal record (DUI etc) after a period of time (10 years) It involves a lot of legwork if you don’t hire legal council, but definitely possible. 

We will be applying fro a construction loan in the next year, so we are trying to scrub and polish our credit reports as much as possible to be good candidates. Unfortunately she was given terrible financial advice when my wife was younger, and is still paying for it (literally). 

I don’t feel like this service sounds legit though...one red flag is that this guy mentioned to her that he’s had ‘good success’ while also hinting that it was a surefire method. 🤷🏽‍♂️ 

My gut tells me that just telling the truth and showing that she has had stable credit building since her BK and her score does reflect that. We will be going to a private lending firm that will most likely be more sensitive to their potential client’s financial needs without flat out denying them, like a big bank would. 
"
superheroninja,"As much as I’ve heard from my wife, he contacts the bureaus and submits various request documents...it seems strange why there would be monthly billing. My only guess Is that it’s is to make the process more affordable for those who need it. I’ve never heard of this before so I figured I’d come here and see what the brain trust has knowledge of regarding this.

He is an elected treasurer, but as we all know, just because you’re elected doesn’t mean you’re trustworthy. "
superheroninja,"Thanks for the info...after hearing everything,I’ve come to that same conclusion. Seems like a nominal benefit, if it even works..we will be applying together for a construction loan and I have had solid credit for 20 years so we should be good and I’m not too concerned about it 👍

"
superheroninja,"I definitely have my doubts; I’m very wary of any sort of salesman.

 You guys need income. Your husband and you should be doing everything you can to make every dollar you can. Him not having any income for 2 months is madness in your situation. Your debt is so out of control that he not only should have had a job, he should have also had a second job/side hustle."

The reason for the denial may not have anything to do with your income. For secured cards, your credit line is determined by the amount of your security deposit and $200 is the minimum deposit amount. Save up and try again when you can put down at least $400.

You might also try applying for student cc from your existing banking relationship or credit union. All the major national banks have student versions of their cc, including Capital One.

Other reasons for keeping your money in a bank include direct deposit, FDIC insurance, and the unfortunate fact that safes are not indestructible or unbreakable.

Assuming you won't stay unemployed for the rest of your life and assuming you're not a fugitive, you're going to need some kind of account. One alternative is a prepaid banking card, but those come with monthly fees that are almost impossible to avoid."
DinoChkNuggets,"&gt;It's great advice but like most people my age I'd rather pay the minimum each month and pay them off in 30 years

I am very new to retirement and investing but really want to begin saving for my retirement. I see all these different companies to open an account for a Roth IRA but can't decide which one is best for me. I am 29 years old and would like to have a diverse portfolio with a mix of aggressiveness and long term safety.

Any advice, tips, guidance, or questions for me from this group will be really appreciated!

Thanks guys!

&amp;#x200B;

\- And yes I noticed I put Where instead of What\*\*\* I cant change it unfortunately "
jtm89,"Thank you so much for your response! I will check out Fidelity and the boglehead portfolio. If it helps, I can be pretty aggressive with mutual fund minimums to start out to set myself up strong for the long run (especially because im starting this so late in my life compared to the recommended younger age). "

i think your only course of action is just reach out and try to network as much as you can and work on grabbing attention.

GuiltyVeek,"well if you don't have a ROTH IRA, start contributing to 1 asap. You also not contributing much into 403B is concerning, how will you retire like this?

not sure what 80k a year is monthly after tax but you spend a lot on CC bill."
GuiltyVeek,"i'm not financial advisor but as a professional in investments, lemme give my opinions on fee only.

what really is the value from fee only? you create a ""plan"" for the next 50 years for $1000 instead of 1% AUM? what is the value from the plan?

Can your client even follow the plan to the end? Will he/she deviate? How well can the plan account for short term volatility like marriage or divorce or first time house buying?

% of AUM? How much value are you really adding per year that a client should continue to pay these numbers? Are your investment choices even changing year on year basis?

As a little maybe off topic, fee sounds great for like an afternoon sitdown every once in a while but in my opinion, young people's financials are **much much more complex** than old people. You're looking to buy a house, have kids, etc, with much less net worth."
GuiltyVeek,"any one of you sick? work in a dangerous industry or job? live in a high COL area with mortgage or rent to go? have young kids?

if yes to 1-2 of these, then yeah I'd consider life insurance in term life insurance. if not, then nah."
GuiltyVeek,"yeah basically no Edward Jones, no Northwestern Mutual. get a real financial adviser or manage your own money

benefit of managing your own money in index funds? cheaper. won't be in expensive funds.

con of managing your own money in index funds? maybe some stress. some people aren't educated. many people are bad at planning cash flow and saving for retirement. many people can't handle crashes in the market emotionally and well financially."
GuiltyVeek,"Yes this. if you look at any adviser some questions I would ask:

-what is their specialty? methods of investment? are they good at planning around liquidation events?

-what are some of their risk-adjusted returns? What is the drawdown that comes with it? what is the standard deviation that comes with that portfolio?

OP is rich so there's no need to match market returns or beat. literally the amount of income come in and protecting the net worth is most important goal, while adding a good risk adjusted return annually."
GuiltyVeek,"well if you go down, a almost all of the population goes down with you

only way you won't really lose it all is with some risk diversification in other assets like bonds.

you also probably want to make sure you contribute max you can to retirement accounts, if there's left over, add some to brokerage instead of having it all in savings.

there's no not lose it all and still make a decent return. choose 1 or the other."
GuiltyVeek,"high inheritance or high salary.

the way to be rich is having a high paying job or high base to invest off of, or essentially just saving a ton which requires a high paying job.

I can't contribute to ROTH IRA but I do max 401K and contribute a lot to brokerage account"
GuiltyVeek,"Because a lot of very good funds people want to invest to can be closed to new investors and aren't accepting money from people with small portfolios. when people invest in these funds, they don't buy through something like an ETF or stock

It doesn't work in practice because again it's just using historical data and forecasts You can execute it sure, but you never know.

Most people investing in PE/VC have much higher salaries and big net worth.

Anyway, you're thinking too much about portfolio theory when it's not the important aspect. If you don't understand for example PE funds or VC funds and their respectful portfolios, you don't really understand the risks and expected growth of what you're holding.

Put it this way, I care more about what I'm investing in and how that's beneficial, not portfolio theory lol. Portfolio theory comes after I've decided on what I want to invest in.

edit: I think these asset classes are much more risky than you're considering: you're focusing too much on portfolio theory which isn't the important aspect."
GuiltyVeek,"&gt;I am very interested in the world of finance and have been investing on my own since I was in ninth grade.

Good for you

&gt;I'd like to eventually open my own fund and manage money and I see no reason to not start as soon as possible.

That comes after you have at least gained some experience working in an actual asset management firm or hedge fund."
arm7_man88,"I feel like you've answered your own question. You want a super safe way to get a return on your own money besides just having it in a savings account, there is no better way than making extra payments on your house and getting it paid off a lot sooner."
arm7_man88,"Usage means how much you haven't paid off at the end of every billing cycle. If you have a 1k credit limit on the card and you've used 800 dollars that month and then pay off 600 when your bill is due then that leaves 200 dollars you have used and haven't paid off, in other words, 20 percent."
arm7_man88,"If you know that the debt is legit and that you can pay it for less than you originally owed on it and they will delete it from your report you should jump all over this. Call them and tell them you accept, however, you need to tell them that you require confirmation either through email or through regular mail that the debt has been paid and that they promise to remove it from your credit reports."
arm7_man88,"Secured credit card is the best way to start, save up 1k, then open a card with that 1k as your credit line and pay off the full balance every month. Discover has an excellent secured card with cashback rewards."
arm7_man88,Idk the rest of what your situation looks like but my best guess is that you are not having enough taxes taken out of your paychecks. When you fill out your tax forms for your job I would suggest putting 0 under your deductions. They will take more out of your checks but you will actually start getting a refund.
arm7_man88,"There is a bot that will likely comment here soon with some links I highly suggest you click on and read through, but here is my advice. Credit scores mostly focus on a couple things; history of credit, something that you can't do anything about right now but that you can start building on; credit utilization, which means how much you owe on your credit card at the end of every due date, the best way to avoid this negatively affecting your score is to make sure you never spend more on your card than you can afford to pay off with your checking account and make sure you pay your full balance every month. I would suggest saving a bit of money, about 1k, and using it to open a secured credit card. Discover has a great one that you can actually get cash back on it. Start using that, and open up a Self Lender account, they charge like a 10 dollar fee up front, then they open a 2 year CD account for you and put money in it for you as a loan, then you slowly pay off that loan a month at a time over 2  years, then you get all your money back plus the interest that is built up with it at the end of the 2 years, and it shows up as a positive account on your credit report. Just make sure you set it up as something low, like only 25 a month, and never miss a payment. Do that and then 2 years from now you will have a much better credit score and can actually apply for some really good credit cards out that are out there."
arm7_man88,"Absolutely. There are several apps out there that are perfect for someone like you. Acorns is a personal favorite of mine. You are already maxing an IRA so just open up a core account with them and they will charge $1 a month to handle all your investments. You can choose how you can contribute, you can make as many one time payments as you'd like, and/or you can have the take out autopayments every day/week/month, and/or you can have the auto roundups. Make sure to set it on the most aggressive setting at your age too."
arm7_man88,"I would highly suggest opening up an IRA soon and start maxing it out on top of what is being taken out of your checks, it's never too early to start really planning for the future. I think the rest of what you are doing seems solid to me. Maybe open a 2nd savings account and start putting money in there for any future plans you have."
Nyxelestia,"Well, high compared to Savings Accounts and some CDs, and to each other (at least on lists like that one). I don't want the money *locked* away from me like in a CD or bond, as I might need it to pay rent, but otherwise I don't plan on touching/using the money."
Nyxelestia,"How much would this poor service put my MMA at risk?

I'm not planning on using the money much. I can't put it into a bond because I might need to access it to pay rent - but if that becomes necessary, I'll have a few days' notice, so I don't need the ability to access it right away, nor do I need things like ATMs or check-writing. Since I sincerely hope I won't need to access it, I just need somewhere to leave my money where it'll grow even a little bit. Online banking would work just fine for me, and as long as I can transfer to and from my primary bank account 2-3 times a month tops, I'm golden.

But it's precisely because that bar is so low that I'm paranoid there's a catch to this interest rate. I know that companies can fuck up even the simplest of services, sometimes, is this likely to be one of them?"
Nyxelestia,"I just need a place to park my $2k. I do not need a card or ATM access, and hopefully I won't need to touch this money at all for a year or two - I just can't tie it up in a bond or CD, either, given I'm using this as back-up / emergency rent money. Hence, high-yield savings or MMAs.

""Online banking only"" feels like such a low bar to me, so I feel like there must be *some* catch to the high rate and no minimum deposit. I get that it's a shitty company - most banks are by default. Maybe it just speaks to my lack of financial experience or my upbringing in the digital age, but as a customer evaluating options for myself, this feels almost too good to be true. "
Nyxelestia,"Can someone explain the Sallie Mae hate to me? Looking for a place to park a $2k ""urgency but not emergency"" fund. I know this sub likes Ally, and I appreciate the 2.20% APY on its savings account. I found a Money Market Account with a 2.30% APY, but it's with Sallie Mae, and I found [this PF post about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/8wling/thoughts_on_sallie_mae_money_market_account/) from 8 months ago. Everyone hated Sallie Mae, but no one said why.

I know they get a lot of hate for their student loaning - and based on everything I've seen and heard, that's more than warranted. But I haven't heard anything about their Money Market Accounts. I'm wondering if the responses on that thread were just hate for the company based on their student loans, or if there is actually something wrong with their MMAs."
Nyxelestia,"That's basically the definition of a bank, you can't really do any kind of financial business and *not* be supporting - directly or indirectly - an asshole or someone engaging in shitty practices of one kind or another.

Actually, it's damn near impossible to do *anything* in a developed country in the 21st century without supporting something nasty. I'm all for boycotts, but only when they're organized and effective. Otherwise, there's no point, and it just posits to put the onus of good behavior on consumers instead of companies. I'd rather reform or overhaul the government to end shitty business practices."
Nyxelestia,"What's the catch for Money Market Accounts with low or no minimum deposits? I'm perusing articles like [this one](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/best-money-market-accounts/), looking for a decent place to park a $2000 ""urgency but not emergency"" fund. Given how many MMA's have minimum deposits like $10,000, I'm sort of suspicious about accounts which still have comparable or even higher interest rates, yet low or no minimum deposits.

The only consistent trend I seem to have found is that the low/no-minimum accounts usually don't have ATMs or allow check-writing - but in the age of digital banking, those don't seem like ""real"" drawbacks. I can't help but feel that there must be some hidden snag or catch that I can't see.

Am I missing something? Or am I just being paranoid?"
Nyxelestia,"To my understanding, T-Bills don't let you access your money.

Looking at All America Bank now, and I'm seeing two checking accounts for 2.5% APY and *3.0*% APY, so if there aren't any nasty surprises there (and I'm not misunderstanding how they work) I might just go with those. Thank you for the recommendation."
Nyxelestia,"For Schedule C taxes for the self-employed, can you deduct miles for driving to clients' locations, or are those considered part of your commute? Thinking ~~again~~ about becoming a self-employed tutor. To my understanding of Schedule C taxes, the IRS does not allow deductions for commutes - but it does allow deductions for driving to meet with clients. If I'm driving to a client's home or campus directly from my own home, is that deductible?

Also - I currently drive for Postmates. I was a dumbass who didn't realize that along with my gas receipts, I needed to track miles as well for tax deducations. I will be starting to this week. I basically go go online the moment I get into my car by my home, but I also typically drive to a good location for more/better orders. I regularly get orders on my way to those locations, long before I arrive at my original intended destination. Do I start tracking miles from the moment I go online, as I'm ""on-call"" for my work, or is it only during the actual orders/deliveries themselves?"
Nyxelestia,"Thank you. The IRS isn't necessarily much clearer, since it gives two different/contradictory answers (at least in my case) in the same section, but I don't think that's something Reddit can help me with.

Nyxelestia,"Yikes, that is definitely a legitimate problem that worries me. I'm planning on saving this as back-up rent money, and while I'll generally have a few days' notice if I need to access the money, I'll also *only* have a few days' notice if I need to access the money. D:"
sifl1202,"it doesn't seem like you can really afford college currently. you simply need a higher income right now. and a degree at 35+ is not nearly the investment that one is at age 22, which is already becoming a tenuous deal for an increasing number of people."
sifl1202,"the wise thing would be not to spend almost a year's take home pay on a car. every dollar you save right now is worth more than every dollar you will save in the future. simply put, sacrificing two of your first few years' worth of savings for a vehicle (which will also be expensive to insure and maintain, as well as depreciate quickly) is not fiscally responsible, and you probably know that. at your earning potential, it won't cost you the ability to retire comfortably, but it will delay that by a couple years. the choice just comes down to what you value more."
sifl1202,"how early you can retire depends on how long your parents pay for everything for you. that's the biggest wildcard in the equation. if it's forever, you could retire right now. if they stop right now, you'll probably have to work into your 50s."
sifl1202,"on almost 100k a year, you can afford housing, transportation, food, utilities, health care, and everything comfortably. depending on how expensive your lifestyle is, future events such as having children etc, and making a similar income to what you are now, you could support yourself and retire in your mid 50s with a couple million net worth. every year you are willing/able to live with your parents should allow you to retire about two years earlier."
sifl1202,"don't do it. it will not save money over the corolla until you drive for a long, long time (you have to drive the corolla about 10,000 miles to spend $1,000 on gas) and you're risking grievous injury if you are involved in a minor accident."
sifl1202,"well between the two choices, i would try to move if possible, with the condition that you can afford to live somewhere you want to live long term. my reason is that you probably want to move to a better neighborhood eventually anyway, so moving will accomplish multiple things, whereas an expensive private school for a young child isn't a great investment in my opinion."
sifl1202,"so giving them an allowance, they're basically on a salary rather than hourly and now they're going to expect to be paid just for being ""part of the x""? i prefer OP's strategy of making it clear that at least some money for ""wants"" should be earned. they are taken care of for being part of the family as far as food, health, education, etc. go."
sifl1202,"this might not be a popular opinion but i would bet your child will be fine even in a ""bad"" school, at least until adolescence, if you are the type of parent that values learning. i wouldn't sweat it much for at least the next 5 years. save money aggressively and then consider moving, especially if you have a higher household income then."
sifl1202,you're going to put wear on tires no matter how old or new your car is. that's kind of like considering a new vehicle because yours needs an oil change. it makes far more financial sense to do the maintenance on your current vehicle.
sifl1202,"no, that would be a terrible choice. you're going to get fleeced for insurance for any newish vehicle. with that in mind, i'd buy a reputable decade old car that you can pay off in just a few months, and drive it for a few years at least until your insurance rate becomes reasonable."
outerspaceways,"Even if you took out a loan for $1500 (and that's *if* you can even get one on a used bike), you also have to pay for insurance, gas, maintenance, and proper riding gear.  If you're worried about making payments on a $1500 loan, I wouldn't recommend buying it at least not before saving up and paying cash."
outerspaceways,Skip the CD and just put the money in a high yield savings account.  The piddling amount of interest you would get compared to a 2.2% Ally account isn't worth locking your money up for a year just in case you need it sooner for whatever reason.  You otherwise sound like you're on the right track.
outerspaceways,"2 inquiries in a short span will likely more or less be treated as one for purposes of your credit score. 

Also, I wouldn't sweat .75% of interest on a car loan too much if you already have a good relationship with your credit union and would rather do business with them.  Just throw extra money at it and pay it off earlier."
outerspaceways,"With the salary you'll be making you can also pay off the car in one month of working, and if you wanted you could drop down to liability-only coverage. 

That said, since you have other things, namely the credit card debt, that are probably a higher financial priority, throw money at those first.  You could also experiment by parking the car for 2 weeks and trying to go without it.  If you make it two weeks and don't feel the need to use it, sell the car."

3. How secure is your living at home with parents?  I'd stash $2000 in a savings account as your emergency fund just in case something goes awry and you need to move out or if your car breaks down.  Maybe a bit more in a high cost of living area.
4. Don't bother doing brokerage investing until you've maxed out tax-advantaged options like your HSA (assuming your health plan allows for one), Roth IRA, and 401k.  Keep in mind that any investing you do in taxable accounts needs to not only beat the interest rate on your student loans and any dividends on said investments will be subject to taxes, meaning you'd have to make *more* than the student loan interest to come out ahead.  If your loans were at like 2%, that's one thing, but 6% and 10% is just too high to justify not paying them down fast.

After you've got that $2k in place, throw every dollar you have minus the $2k at the student loans.  If you refi the 100k loan to something more reasonable than 10%, pay off the smaller loan first (paying the minimum on the other) and snowball that extra cash flow into the bigger one.

A number of them come with clauses that require you to pay the money back (possibly pro-rated) if you leave the company before a certain amount of time has passed, and you definitely do not want to get stuck having to pay back a signing bonus you no longer  have.

I think the safest route would be to treat the signing bonus as your new 6 month emergency fund and throw every dollar remaining out of your monthly budget (though I would make sure to at least get a maxed Roth and 401k to the match) at the loan your parents gave you, because they did you a huge favor and unless there are other reasons you're not detailing in his post, I would want to pay them back as soon as possible."

outerspaceways,"It sounds like you *might* be a bit overboard - you are well above the standard ""15% of your income into retirement"" mantra that is often prescribed.  It's probably better to be more overboard on saving than spending, though.

Perhaps what might be a good idea is to do a couple of things:

1. Increase the ""blow"" section of your regular budget.  It sounds like you, today, lump it into ""misc"" when you should have it as a separate line item, and you should spend that money every month.  If you're uncomfortable after a month, your budget is not eternal panacea - it can be adjusted over time.

2. Have a prescribed windfall budget.  If you get a windfall (whether a tax refund or bonus or otherwise), you should have a plan for the money before you even get it - as an example, 30% brokerage, 30% paying down mortgage, 20% cash savings, 10% charitable donation, 10% spending on random wants.  What percentages and how they are allocated are up to you, obviously."
outerspaceways,"&gt;  I worry that I don't have enough income to make meaningful contributions to all three of those at once.

This right here tells me that if you're not already maxing your 401k, you should put your money there first, given you're already maxing a Roth.  A taxable brokerage account won't give you any advantages over a tax-deferred 401k besides maybe fund selection."

outerspaceways,"There are plenty of solid recommendations given for a savings account more or less every day on this subreddit.  Ally and CIT Bank are often thrown around;  I use Ally myself for the two-factor authentication and decent interest rate.

I personally like having a separate checking and savings (with larger amounts in savings) to have a figurative wall put in place in case someone skims my debit card at an ATM (which is unfortunately a real possibility).  If you get skimmed, having less of your money in checking will limit how much money the thieves can get access to.  While a good bank will help you sort all of that out and you probably wouldn't be out any money in the end because of fraud, that money might be tied up for a while."
outerspaceways,"The only reason I would pay it down would be if your car is worth less than $22k and you don't have gap insurance - if you don't have a big chunk of savings to cover the loan deficit in case of an accident, you're still liable for the remainder of the loan and will still need a car afterward.

2nd question: I've been researching different savings accounts and found some with decent rates.

leveraged_loan,"Should I continue to lever up?  

I have been trying to plan long-term for FI, however wanted the insight/advice from Redditers.

My current situation. 26, living in NYC with my fiancée. Two years ago, we purchased a luxury 1BR apartment and took out a $700k mortgage. We have no debt otherwise (student loans fully paid, no cc debt). However, we obviously cannot live in the 1BR as we start planning for kids. The plan is to eventually buy a 3BR-4BR house in NY (most likely will cost \~$1.3MM - $1.5MM + $150k for renovation). Given my upbringing, I was conditioned to want to own as many properties as possible. The plan would be to purchase the new house in possibly 5-7 years, and then rent out my existing apartment for \~$3.2K per month.

However, my fiancée doesn’t believe we should accumulate so much debt. I understand that the rent will not cover the mortgage + maintenance, however once the mortgage is fully paid off, it could be viewed as passive income. I think my desire to keep the apartment is two parts: (1. passive income, 2. sentimental value of my first property which I understand is stupid. )

A little background on our financial standings

* Monthly joint income after taxes - $9.5K (We both max out our 401k / HSA every year, and this does not include our annual bonus of \~$40K-$70K. We both also expect to get modest raises this year)
* Mortgage + Maintenance - $4.2K
* Property Tax - $10 (tax abatement for next 15 years, however once the abatement rolls off, it will be closer to $700)
* Utilities (internet + electricity) - $120
* Gym - $60
* Groceries - $150 (we occasionally get food from our parents)
* Eating Out - $400 (this is generally the max, as we typically may eat out once or twice a week, and we do not crave fancy meals unless it’s for a long overdue date)
* Discretionary Spending - $500 (conservative number for random unexpected things that may come up)

Since depleting a good chunk of our net worth to put in a deposit for the property, our combined net worth is sitting around \~$250K (excluding our property) and we continue to look to grow our net worth. Anyone thoughts into the idea of utilizing leverage to reach financial independence? At what point should one stop leveraging. "
leveraged_loan,"&gt;As a parent that is crazy. The last thing I want is to burden my kids with paying me back for doing my job to raise them.

&amp;#x200B;

There were a lot of factors going into this. Keep in mind, they definitely do not need my money as they are both doing well in life. They have already achieved FI, but continues to work. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I never viewed it as a burden since I do not generally spend much, however I also wanted them to appreciate the fruit of their labor. They worked extremely hard to pay for prep school, travel expenses, my hobbies, etc. The least I could do is to make sure I don't remain a burden for them.
2. Financial literacy was important in my family. My parents would never force me to pay for something that I cannot afford. Following graduation, I was making $65k a year, and lived at home. So, I viewed this as rent/food expense. I moved out once I switched jobs and received a pay bump, but wanted to continue to pay this $500. 
3. It is also traditional for Asian children to care for their parents once they are out in the workforce. Everyone in my family does this. Not saying that this should be the norm, but cultural relativism.
4. I am just grateful for my parents in general. I am not only paying them for being my parents, but also for being great parents that provided for me and provided me with so many opportunities that led to where I am today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason I stopped paying them was due to the fact that I realized that they do not spend the money that I give them. So now I just simply buy them random gifts (flights, mattresses, home upgrades they contemplate but do not want to pull the trigger on). Etc.

leveraged_loan,"I recently purchased an apartment with my fiancee. At the time of closing, my fiancee was working corporate and pulling slightly more than me (+$5k). However, shortly after, she switched over to a start-up, where I now make nearly twice as much as she does. 

&amp;#x200B;

I offered to pay for more as well, however she turned it down and we continue to pay the mortgage 50/50 (just more simple). We sat down and began calculating our net worth eventually she realized she was not saving as much as she used to. As such, we came to certain agreements where it would make the relationship more fair given the income disparity (ex. I'll cover all groceries, I'll pay for her meals when we dine out and it comes under $40, etc).

I don't think there's a perfect formula. It's a matter of what you guys feel comfortable. "
leveraged_loan,"I’ve considered it and loved the idea that I would be paying interest back to myself.

If you currently live by yourself (no roommates, no parents), then I would say that's a true representation of how you guys are living together.

My 60 mile daily round trip sucks and is sucking the life out of it. Thinking about buying a cheapy car to use as a pure commuter car. Getting a car with double the gas mileage (40 mpg vs 20 mpg) will save me roughly $400 a year after subtracting insurance and plates. This isn’t a lot, will never pay off the difference of the commuter car, but it will allow me to keep the truck longer and prevent me from buying another $40k truck sooner rather than later. Is there a way to quantify this ability to hold onto the truck longer?"
TAG_X-Acto,"Yea it is difficult to quantify which I was hoping someone had it figured out already. I do find it hard to believe a modern vehicle would last past 200k miles. So much electronic shit to break. My buddy had a newer car with 140k that needed a wiring harness replaced because one wire broke. So that totaled the car, it was going to be a $3000 fix on a car worth about $5k. I would only buy something I know I would like, as long as something has CarPlay in it, I’m golden. I’d rather not drive the Colorado and get more paint chipped off the hood. So many highway miles and so many rock chips."
TAG_X-Acto,"Well like I said, I did that math already, I’m going to save about $400 per year on fuel costs after insurance and plates. My question is how do I calculate the value of not having to purchase a newer more expensive vehicle sooner and buying a cheaper car now. It’s hard to put a value on it. To me it seems making the truck last much longer while putting a lot of miles on a cheap car seems like a good idea. And to answer your question, I have V6 with 6 speed. My average tank gets me 19mpg. I’m a combination of highway, city, and standstill traffic on my commute."

Once you've paid it off, take the money you were putting towards it and put it towards your next highest loan. Once you've paid that loan off just keep going until your debt is gone.  It'll be a slow start, but you'll really pick up steam.  This is called the avalanche method.  Here's a handy tool that can show you the timeline you're looking at: http://unbury.us/"
kirkl3s,"Yeah, I edited my comment and removed that after thinking about it for a sec.  I pay a lot less and I live in the city, but I bought in an up and coming area - so there are trade offs"
kirkl3s,"Vangaurd has a [retirement calculator](https://retirementplans.vanguard.com/VGApp/pe/pubeducation/calculators/RetirementIncomeCalc.jsf) that factors in a pension.

A word of caution - in this day and age I would not completely trust a pension. I have no idea what your wife's pension is like, but they can be subject to mismanagement which means they may not get paid out in full.  If your wife has the option to switch to a more traditional 401k or 403b, I'd consider doing that. 

The money in pension funds is not owned by its beneficiaries - it's owned by whoever is managing the pension. Your wife can't make decisions about how it's invested or disbursed. If you invest in a retirement fund, you own that money and can manage it as you see fit. It's your money. "
kirkl3s,I was in academic affairs with an MBA program and I just had a standard BA in poly sci. Most of my colleagues had either MAs in Higher Ed or MBAs.  What you want to get is up to you. A masters is a lot of work so it's something you should think carefully about.
kirkl3s,"Bro, you're always going to have to pay taxes on your income. There is simply no other option. In most cases, it will be more than 15%.

As for the union fees, you probably agreed to them when you signed your hiring documents and paying them is probably a condition of the job you took. If you don't want to pay union fees, you should find a non-union job."
kirkl3s,"Pay off the loans. Good credit is important, but it's importance is vastly overstated by people that run credit monitoring and debt consolidation businesses. Not paying interest on your car loan is far more valuable than your credit score being a few points higher."
kirkl3s,"Basically, you should be making the min payments on your lower interest rate debts and putting the rest of the money towards the highest interest rate.  If your min payments will vary, simply make the min payments on the two smaller loans first and then put the remainder towards your highest interest loan.

unbury.me is just a calculator and it's not dynamic. It's giving you a general idea of what an avalanche payment plan will look like."
kirkl3s,"What salary does your offer letter list? If it's the Tech II salary, only 1 or 2 will happen.  If it's the Tech I salary and they've been overpaying you, they can request repayment.

As shitty as it seems, employers can reduce your salary with little to no notice. If they agreed to pay you at a higher rate and then change their mind, they can't just take the money back, though.

It'd be worth looking at your local laws to understand exactly what legal constraints your company is under. Maybe pop over to r/legaladvice and see what they say."
kirkl3s,"Whew lad. Ok, so $60K debt isn't an outrageous amount, but $20K in CC debt is. You're going to waste thousands and thousands in interest servicing that shit. The good news is, you can get rid of your debt.

So, step 1: get on a budget. Refer to the wiki on how to do it, but you need to get your spending under control and understand what resources you have at your disposal to attack your debt. Pay the minimums on your car loan and your student loan and put anything left towards your CC. Stop making frivolous purchases and resign yourself to not having that much fun until your CC debt is gone. 

Step 2: get rid of the car.  Sell it, use that $$ to pay off the car loan. Buy a beater and drive it until you can actually afford to own a decent car. Put the money you would have put toward your car payment toward the CC debt.

Step 3: once the CC debt is gone, start on the SL or start putting money towards your retirement. Which is the correct answer is up to you and depends on the interest rate on the SL."
kirkl3s,"This question is hard to answer without more info:

1.) What's housing market like? Are home values appreciating quickly or are the generally holding steady?

2.) What are your personal finances like? Would you like more wiggle room in your monthly budget? Do you have any other debt that you need to pay off?

3.) What's your new mortgage interest rate?

Generally speaking, putting the full $350K toward your new home is that safest bet. You're guaranteed the return of paying less interest. The market may go up, or it may go down. 

Plus, not having your home paid off in short order is amazing for financial security. You're essentially eliminating your single largest monthly expense from your budget.

All in all, I'd probably put the full $350K toward the new home. But I'm cautious and debt averse."
kirkl3s,"Honestly, I wouldn't sweat it. Opening and closing accounts will always effect your credit score, but unless you're planning on getting a mortgage or large car loan in the immediate future, the 22 point drop really isn't a big deal. Just keep making your payments on time and your score will go back up. The accounts will show up eventually.

Just a word of advice: don't get too wound up over your credit score. It's not a measure of your financial health or personal worth. It's merely a metric that lenders use to evaluate your suitability and risk to take on more debt."
kirkl3s,"You need at least 3, preferably 6 mo of expenses in savings. That means, you need at least $5010+3x your monthly grocery bill (this will cover both you and your gf).  Ideally, you'll have $10,620+6x your monthly grocery bill.

Now, that's just your emergency fund for if you get laid off, sick, your car breaks down, you need a new roof, etc. You should maintain that in a place that's easy to access, like a savings account. This is not investment money.

You also need to be saving for retirement via a 401k and an IRA. You should use a retirement calculator to understand what sort of contributions you should be making now.

As for the loan, it's a dumb idea. Get your emergency fund loaded, make sure you're making retirement contributions, then save up the money and buy the trailer outright."
kirkl3s,"There may be a 5th option, which would be taking the semester off to work and then picking your studies back up once you've got that cash to pay for it. That would be preferable to taking out a high interest loan to complete your education. From what you wrote, it seems that you're already taking the courses which probably means you can't drop them without financial penalty (correct me if I'm wrong).

If you can't take the semester off, cashflow is your best option. Your emergency fund can wait - particularly if it means avoiding 9%-14% interest rates. 

If you absolutely can't do scrape together $1k/mo, then you need to look at financial aid/private student loans. I think you're making some assumptions here that may not be correct - specifically about financial aid from your school and the terms/rates that a private student loan would have. You need to explore these options before you make your decision. First stop is your school's financial aid office. See what they can do for you.  If they can't help you out, you need to look into a private student loan. I would be surprised if a private lender offered you a rate higher than 8.9%. 

Loans at 9%+ interest rates are your absolute worst option. If you have any alternative, you should not use your line of credit, take out a personal loan or put the tuition on your CC."
kirkl3s,"[NYC does have some first home buyers assistance programs](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/owners/homeowner-downpayment-assistance.page)

$75k for a $200K apartment is a great down payment, so no sweat there. Even at a 15 year mortgage, that comes to an affordable monthly payment for your salary.  

What you need to keep in mind while you're looking are the ancillary costs like closing costs, condo fees, necessary repairs, taxes, insurance, etc etc. None of these should be prohibitive but they will factor into how much you have for a down payment and what your monthly payment ends up being, so you need to be aware. 

But off the cuff, I'd say that yes, with $75K for closing on a $200k home, you can definitely afford it. "
kirkl3s,"The childcare is what's getting you. I know DC COL is high (I own a house in the city and have two kids) but a  $4100/mo in childcare is a lot more than most of my peers spend on their kids. If you want to cut down on your monthly expenses, that's the place to look at.  

Also, $1500/mo for groceries is pretty high. You could probably easily shave $500 off that if you do the shopping yourself (I spend less than $1000/mo without being very careful about what I buy). 

In terms of the  ""everything else"" category you've got there, you could make some changes. I don't know the specifics of your situation, but some examples could be: skip the organized fitness classes and find a cheaper way to keep fit. Go to the Y for swimming lessons instead of more expensive alternatives. Netflix instead of the cinema. etc etc.
"
kirkl3s,"Wow, you're killing it! Way ahead of where I was at 18.  

Honestly, the best place for you to start is the wiki [Prime Directive](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and the [18-25](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/young_adult) page

As for the $11K, it sound like you'll want some access to it but you want it to accrue some interest. Generally, those two things are fairly mutually exclusive. You might consider a money market account.  You'll get a higher rate of return than a savings account, but you can still write yourself checks from it."
kirkl3s,"Down payment and closing costs require a lot of upfront capitol. Make sure you understand how much money you'd like to put down and get a general idea of the closing costs for your area. Make sure you've got that money on hand before you start looking.

Also, look into first-time buyer programs and other incentives in your area. A lot of state and local governments have programs to help people buy their first home. "
kirkl3s,"Sorry- re reading that I came off real judgey. My apologies

Since you have decent credit, I wouldn't worry that much about your score.  Your credit score is just a metric that lenders use to analyze the risk of lending to you. People tend to overestimate its importance because businesses that do credit monitoring and debt consolidation emphasize it as the primary indicator of financial health. It's not. It's important to have good credit if you're planning on getting a mortgage, but beyond that don't sweat it.  You're probably better off just keeping your CC and sticking with the current set up.

As for the Amazon card - it's up to you.  If you don't want to use it anymore, you don't need to. If you decide not to use it, close it. The effect will be minuscule."
dcamp2006,"I would agree with the above post. Also, you mention it’s a large house - do you need it? Is selling this current place and looking for a new smaller (and cheaper) home feasible? What would you approximate the value of the home be?"
dcamp2006,"My vote would be to stay in the apartment and save for a few reasons:

-Downpayment/closing costs, while there are some zero down options again usually reserved for doctors/specialized professions or certain specific qualifiers 
-When you buy you’ll likely spend money on new furnishings, painting, changing things
-Emergency funds- when something breaks in a condo/house you fix it, I swear I never had things break in an apt like I do in my condo.  
-Emergency funds for life as well, you never know what may happen

Also, I bought my place around your age and in hindsight I kind of regret it...I don’t like being so tied down. I sometimes wish I could move to a different area of the city but the thought of selling or becoming a landlord is not appealing ATM. YMMV here of course."
dcamp2006,"General rule of thumb is to keep the home value around 3x your annual gross salary - this is not hard and fast as it depends on the personas situation such as downpayment and other debt payments. Sounds like it may be difficult to find a place in your price range where you live currently. 

Look into any first time homebuyer grants in your area/state. I received one from the state of Illinois for $7500 - just had to make less than $86k and home less than $300k or so."
dcamp2006,"Fixed too?! Yeah that’s a pretty good deal as a backup if you ever need it, rate is lower than many HELOCs. You’ll take the usual short term hit on credit for bringing down AAOA and the inquiry if there is one, but would help utilization.

Edit: Out of curiosity what bank?"
dcamp2006,If you’re not applying for any credit in the next month a dip caused by utilization increasing can be reversed when your payment reports on the next statement cycle. I wouldn’t be concerned about this momentary dip unless you are in the middle of a mortgage or other important application process.
dcamp2006,"I agree if this is at all possible. In college while living with two buddies me and another guy found out the third who was in your “role” hadn’t been paying the landlord the full amount due to money issues for him. We found this out with a notice taped to our door..

 Granted it’s a little different since you’re the one paying, but you can’t easily count on your roommates to always pay you on time."
dcamp2006,"Unfortunately the few ruin it for the many. I manage a branch of a small family run bank and even we see attempted online fraud quite routinely from new accounts. Technology is great but it’s another way for folks to access your funds.

Edit: This is why there’s limits on various transaction types such as external transfers, debit card transactions and mobile check deposit - especially for smaller banks that can’t eat losses as easily as a larger institution."
dcamp2006,"Is the check drawn off the bank? If not try the bank it is drawn off of, I’d call ahead just to see if they would to be safe though as they don’t have to and will have their own policies. Can also try a currency exchange which charge 1% here in Chicago, but I’m not sure their rules about non-residents."
dcamp2006,"Typically you would have a car picked out first, although some banks don’t require that and have a “check ready” loan where you are approved up to a certain limit and they issue you a check to write to the dealership. 

The price you saw likely does not include customary fees such as state fees and taxes which of course can be a good amount."
dcamp2006,"You lose the funds you were not vested in upon your separation from the company. I had a former employer who kept sending me statements for the amount I wasn’t vested in for probably two years before they finally took the money out of the 401k even though I had already transferred the money I did own to an IRA. 

I’d recommend transferring the funds you are vested in into an IRA where you have much more control over the investments since you are limited within a 401k."
dcamp2006,"Your savings likely had no minimum if it’s the student VW, but be sure to verify. Their HYSA is only for markets they don’t have a branch presence is my understanding. 

The only real downside IMO is if you need the funds in a hurry, like today, you may not be able to get them for 1-2 days. But since you keep a decent amount in your checking I assume this isn’t an issue."
dcamp2006,"Was this a new car when you bought it? Do you know the approximate value by chance? First step would be to look up the cars value and see if it’s sufficient to payoff the loan.

Edit: Once that’s known then can figure out next steps."
dcamp2006,"-Your credit history would not carry over, it’s based on your US SSN.  

-Do you have an address of a family member/friend in the US you can use? This may be an issue regardless though as many banks will run IDV/credit in addition to chex which verifies addresses, when there’s a mismatch typically you must then provide a proof of address. 

-Most banks have mobile deposit, even small community banks these days. Larger banks and especially online only have much higher limits for mobile deposit."
dcamp2006,"Your family member can deposit it and just say a car was sold, it’s honestly no big deal. People deposit or withdraw $10k+ all the time. Bank won’t bat an eye at someone doing it once with a common reason."
dcamp2006,As others have said go with a “starter” card company such as Cap1. Also look into the cards offered by wherever you bank. Usually banks will take a combination of your FICO and an internal score based on your relationship with them which can help overcome other factors such as limited/no revolving line history. 
dcamp2006,"Do your research and find out what is an expected salary for this type of position. You can either come prepared to the initial meeting with this in hand or ask to have a few days to review and come back to them. Once you know your target salary and present it, if they decline/counter then I would counter with a two part raise - whatever their counter is at the start of the role and another after 6-12 months (you decide) of satisfactory performance in the role to bring you up to your desired and position typical salary."
dcamp2006,"I would agree with the posts above that you likely don’t need to pay someone (a fee based advisor) at this point. What topics in particular are you interested in covering. Two things that should be considered off the bat after a budget is:


-Create an emergency fund if you haven’t already, held in a safe savings vehicle such as a high yield savings

-Fund your 401k to the max of the match if you aren’t already, don’t leave that money from your employer on the table. 


Other things to consider are insurance needs, retirement outside of 401k if contributing to the max match, how to tackle any debt and plan for large expected purchases. Lots of help can be found online, in books or on here for these topics. "
dcamp2006,"This is very common for any new bank account, especially online openings where fraud is rampant. Just because it cleared your checking doesn’t mean someone couldn’t then put in an ACH return and try to take the funds back if it was fraud. If the new bank gave immediate availability they could have moved those funds elsewhere so the victim wouldn’t have recourse. Once you’ve had an account for a certain period (typically 30 days) you will see faster availability."
dcamp2006,"Have to agree here, this isn’t a sustainable career. I’m also not saying you need to go to college but just think about what you want to do long term which could be in content creation of some sort as you do now."
dcamp2006,"I’d agree with the others and just leave it in a high yield savings, for that amount of money it’s not worth looking into investments that could lose principal or have other downsides. Unless you plan to add to it opening a college savings isn’t feasible either for that amount.  Keep it liquid as well so he can access if need be."
Vandrel,"No minimum balance on it at all. I think you can set up direct deposit to put part of a paycheck in it automatically. I linked my checking account to it and can pretty much freely transfer money to the savings account from it. I have the option of settings up an automatic monthly transfer but I decided against using that for now, I'm just going to be transferring money in manually.

So basically, no requirements, no minimum balances, nothing like that. You can just put money in as you see fit, whatever works for you, with some options available to do it automatically."
Vandrel,"If you're selling privately (which I assume you'd do in this case) then you'd take the money from the buyer to pay off the loan, get the title from the bank, and sign over the title to the buyer. I don't know if most banks do it exactly this way but at my local bank I'd be able to just go to the main location and get the title immediately upon paying off the loan. If you're unsure, it can't hurt to talk to somebody at the bank that has your loan about what their process is."
Vandrel,"Do you have a history with credit cards already? If not, your options are extremely limited to start. I have a few years of mortgage, car, and student loan payments but was still rejected for the higher end credit cards I applied to recently, including the Chase Freedom card that someone else mentioned, specifically for not already having credit cards before. I ended up going with the Capital One Journey card because it's more lenient towards people without a history of credit cards already established while not being a secured card and having 1.25% cash back, got accepted no problem."
Vandrel,"May as well get the ball rolling as long you can be responsible with it. Just be aware that a lot of them will deny an application for a credit card when you haven't had one before. I ended up going with the Capital One Journey card after being turned down by Discover, Chase, and one of the better Capital One cards. Discover even constantly sends me preapproval mail for their Discover IT cards and they still denied me."
Vandrel,"Sure, the amount paid isn't the same, but you make up for that with the value of the car. For the same amount of money that you'll pay for a lease you can pretty often get something 3 or 4 years older and then own it at the end instead of having to give it back. For anyone in a position where $10-20k is a big deal, it makes way more sense to buy used rather than lease something new."
Vandrel,"I'm in my late 20s and have only used a debit card my entire life. I just recently got a credit card specifically for the rewards part though, but I also have the self control at this point to not spend more on it than I actually have. I don't need one at all, but I'm trying to take advantage of every extra bit of money I can."
Vandrel,"It's not condescending and you were given an explanation. Your current car is already worth less than what you owe on it. You're only going to be compounding the problem by trading it in and adding that loss in value onto a new loan. It means you'll be paying more interest on that money. Furthermore, why do you need to get another car to be ""building your credit""? In what way is a loan on a different car going to build your credit differently than the loan on your current car?"
Vandrel,"An Amazon/Twitch Prime subscription gets you a set of games every month. For April they gave Her Story, InnerSpace, Joggernauts, and Keep in Mind: Remastered along with items for PUBG, Warframe, Overwatch, and a bunch of smaller games, as well as a month of Nintendo Online for any subscribers with a Switch. I have a ton of games in my Amazon/Twitch library from collecting these games every month for however long they've been doing it, along with getting lots of items in games I play."
Vandrel,"Sometimes it just doesn't seem to make sense. My credit score is 720, I've been paying a mortgage and car payment for around 3 years, and still got denied for a couple credit cards I applied to last week. I've seen people suggest a Discover card like in this thread but I don't really want more inquiries on my credit within a short time."
Vandrel,"That is likely not enough to get it. The card is through Chase and I just went through something similar with them. I have a 720 credit score and a few years of mortgage, car, and student loan payments on my history. They told me they wouldn't give me a credit card because I don't already have a history with one. Chase is not a good option for a first credit card."
Vandrel,"I was in kind of a similar situation. I was paying about $275/month on my car payment, $110/month on my insurance, and probably $80-100/month on gas. I've been broke for basically the last two years because of the cost of that on top of all my other bills. I could have refinanced it to get lower payments like you're thinking about but I decided to trade it in for something cheaper instead. I actually just did that last week. Very similar situation all around, in fact. My car's trade-in value was listed at around $13.5-14k while I owed about $10k on it. I went for a 2012 Chevy Volt listed at $10.5k because they're priced quite low thanks to the tax credits the first buyers got and the fact that it would essentially eliminate my gas costs in exchange for like $10 of electricity each month, got them down to $9.5k and $13k for my trade-in. Out the door cost on the car ended up being about $9900, minus the $3k equity I had on the trade and my loan is now about $7k instead. My payments are down to $165/month, insurance is down to $90/month, and my gas costs are essentially nonexistent now since all my daily driving is within the battery range. I highly recommend looking into similar options for anyone in a situation like this."
Vandrel,"Do you think the small risk that something goes catastrophically wrong immediately after you buy a used car is worse than spending thousands of dollars on leasing a car and then having literally nothing to show for it at the end of the lease? You'll likely save more than enough from having lower payments on a 6 or 7 year old used car to fix anything that might go wrong, but chances are you'll come out way ahead. And if you're really that worried about it, if you buy a used car from a dealership of that manufacturer you can typically get a warranty added on at the time of purchase. You could probably get a 3 year/50k mile warranty for something like $1,000 added on. I just did literally that last week. Bought a 2012 Volt with 77k miles on it for $9500, along with an extra $600 added for a 3 year/25k mile warranty. I had about $3k down on it, walked away with payments of about $170/month. You could lease a baseline Jetta for around $200/month and then give it back in a few years, or get a used car for less money and own it at the end.

The fact of the matter is that in 99% of situations, it makes much more sense to buy used, especially when you're only making $15/hr. Believe me, I know exactly what it's like, I currently make $16/hr and am paying both a mortage and a car payment. I'm guessing you don't pay much for bills right now, right? Take this opportunity to actually buy a car. Later on, you'll be thankful to have a car you actually own outright. I certainly wish I'd been smarter about it and done that, I wasted a lot of money the last few years paying much more for a Camaro that I really didn't need."
Vandrel,"Why in the hell did you take it? What were you doing to ""inspect"" it? That sounds suspicious as fuck. Nobody ever takes hardware home to ""inspect"" it. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to. Doing this means you're either incredibly stupid and/or naive, or you had or have malicious intentions.

Seriously, do you have any idea how suspicious this sounds? ""Oh, sorry boss, my computer fell over and the case fell off. I saw the hard drive sitting there inside it so I just figured I'd take it home to look at it. I was going to bring it back, I promise!"" There's just no part of it that makes any logical sense. I've been in IT for over a decade and everywhere I've worked, someone who did this would be fired with no hesitation. At the bank I worked at, they would probably even do some meetings first like what you're talking about with the director and HR to try to figure out what you may have done with the hard drive's data at home.

But seriously, why the hell did you do it if your intentions weren't malicious? Did you think you knew how to handle it better than the IT staff?"
Vandrel,"Nope, they call it a student card but it's one that doesn't actually require you to be a student. I haven't been a student for years and just got it. I got it specifically because it's one that's more lenient towards applications without a history of credit cards but still gives 1.25% cash back."
Vandrel,"Personally, I decided a used Chevy Volt was by far my most best option. Bought one two weeks ago today, a 2012 in great shape with all options and about 77k miles for $9500. I don't know your situation so I can't say whether it would be a good option for you. I got it because my normal driving means that I literally never use any gas unless I have to go out of town. Two weeks in and I've used no gas whatsoever, it's all been within the ~35 mile battery range on the 1st gen Volts. The price on them and other PHEVs is especially low because the $7500 tax credit the first buyer got is factored into the depreciation."
Quan-Su-Dude,"You can see the problem building though, right? You can't pay off this amount now. The amount is only going to grow. You're building yourself a mountain of debt. 

My two cents: If you can, I'd put the student loans in forbearance. Throw every extra penny at those credit cards. You may be shy of paying them off fully, but keep attacking them until they're dead. Your car loan won't kill you, it's at a VERY good rate. Focus on that last.Once the credit cards are done, resume paying on the student loans. Highest interest rate first. 

Pay off your credit card every month from here on out. Why put yourself in this situation again? There may come a time where you can't get approved for a 0% card. That will be a tough hole to dig yourself out of."
Quan-Su-Dude,"I'd get aggressive about paying the student loans off now. You're not even engaged. Idk what you/your SO make or what your other debts are, but being able to save $1200 a month means you can knock out the student loans in under 6 months. Lower your 401k contribution to the employer match if you have one, that'll help expedite the process."
Quan-Su-Dude,"You have a lot on your plate, as a student no less. In addition to what Basic said, you could look into balance transfer cards to stop the bleeding. But your spending is way out of control. Not to mention your credit card choices. 25%?! This seems like a lifestyle issue. Your lifestyle needs to reflect your income."
Quan-Su-Dude,"Do you have enough saved for 1 month's expenses? If not, do that first. Pay the minimum balances on your loans if you can, or you may be able to get a forbearance on your student loans. That way you can pause payments until your small emergency fund is in place. 

Once it is, then you start tackling your debt. Pay the one with the highest interest rate first. No need to save right now. You're not really saving anything anyways, because your net worth is still below $0 until you get those loans paid off. You sound young. Plenty of time to save later, especially since you don't really live an extravagant lifestyle. 

Once the debt is paid off, then fully fund your emergency fund with 3-6 months of expenses. After that you can start saving for retirement."
Quan-Su-Dude,"Does your employer offer an HSA? That's an extra $3500 max a year for single coverage, or $7000 for family you could contribute. Pretty much the same as a brokerage account. Tax advantaged and when there's a certain amount in there you can invest it. Fidelity also just came out with personal HSAs that have no fees."
Quan-Su-Dude,"Roth 401k contributions are post-tax. Which means everything you put in that account has already been taxed, and that you can take it all out later on without paying any taxes. (This will make your take home pay less)  Choosing between a Roth 401k or traditional 401k comes down to whether or not you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket now or when you retire, but it is not unwise to contribute to both.  

If you're asking for my advice, I'd say drop your 401k contribution down to 2% so you get the match. Pay off your truck with the extra take home pay you'll now have. Open a Roth IRA at schwab or vanguard. Dump the money in a 2060 Target Date Fund. Try to max that out every year (last year it was $5500, this year you can put up to $6000) Then start contributing to your 401k again with any leftover money.

If you're saving for a house or wedding, you can pause retirement savings to do that, **but make paying off debt your priority.**"
Quan-Su-Dude,"While this is technically ""using it"" you could put one recurring online subscription on that card like a netflix and spotify, and set the card to automatic payments. $12 a month shouldn't be a shock to your checking account each month, and you can keep the card active without ever having to deal with it."
Quan-Su-Dude,Let me reiterate what Homie_Bama said. DON'T INVEST UNTIL YOU HAVE PAID OFF YOUR DEBTS. Seriously. You're not building wealth by ignoring debt. And for the love of god don't take $ out of your 401k to do this. You need to lower your retirement contributions to the match and throw every extra penny you have at the debt.
Quan-Su-Dude,"Do you have debt? Do you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses? Are you contributing to a 401k up to an employer's match if they have one? Do you have an IRA? Do you know the difference between taxed and tax-advantage brokerage accounts? 

I know you asked about getting into investing, but you need to address all of these things before you start investing. If you're debt-free and you have your emergency fund in place, take a look at ""Investing"" on the sidebar. Lot of great info to help you there."
Quan-Su-Dude,"The good thing about opening an IRA at a place like Schwab or Vanguard is they give you a LOT more to choose from, so you're not stuck with options that have high front load fees or high expense ratios. You can still contribute a max of $5500 for 2018 as long as you do it before Monday.

Yes the 2055 pertains to the year you would retire. Do they not have a 2060 fund? If they do, you should choose that, as it's closer to your actual date. These are what are called Target Date Funds, they're very diversified already, so you really can just plop all your money in one of them and be good to go. 

Target Date Funds work by automatically adjusting your allocations the closer you get to retirement. So say right now the fund is comprised of 90% stocks and 10% bonds, it will automatically adjust for lower risk the older you get, so 80% stocks and 20% bonds, and so on. It's a set it and forget it, which is great for someone just starting out in investing. 

But since it looks like this fund has an expense ratio of .72% I would only contribute up to the employer match in this 401k, and put the rest in an IRA. Where you'll find expense ratios closer to .5% and below."
Quan-Su-Dude,"* Priority #1 create an emergency fund that can cover 1 month's expenses.
* Priority #2 contribute to 401k only up to your employer match if they have one. 
* Priority #3 pay off all truck loans, and any other outstanding debt.
* Priority #4 fully fund your emergency fund with 3-6 months of expenses.
* Priority #5 open a Roth IRA, max out this year's $6000 contribution limit
* Priority #6 throw whatever else you can save into your employer's 401k. 

If you're saving up for other expenses like an engagement ring, a wedding, or a house, it's ok to stop contributing to 401k or a IRA. You're very young and you have a lot of time to contribute."
Quan-Su-Dude,"Having multiple savings accounts is something that really helped me visualize and prioritize what I was setting aside money for. Highly recommend it. But don't just open another account at your exisiting bank because it's convenient. If there's another bank, online or otherwise, that has a higher return rate, take it. Shop around. Opening a new account at a new bank takes 10 minutes of your time, if that. Some have bonuses as well depending on how much you deposit upon opening."
Quan-Su-Dude,"The gold card is a credit card. Not the same thing as a debit card, nor is it tied to a bank. There's also a $250 annual fee. Are you sure that's the card you want? For that card, after 17 months you would have to pay interest only if you don't pay off your card every month. 

If you pay off your credit card bill in full every month, you won't have to pay anything extra. Don't get a credit card just because you can afford to pay the minimum balance. **Pay it off in full every month.**"
Quan-Su-Dude,"I see what's going on here. You're in the UK. I was assuming you were talking about the American Express Gold Card, but you are talking about First Direct's Gold Card. 

Just looked and that is also a credit card. So if she wants to just use her bank balance, she needs to open a checking account with First Direct, and they'll automatically send her a debit card to access those funds without a fee. Also, whatever bank she has her money at now should give her a debit card without having to pay a monthly fee to use it."
Quan-Su-Dude,"For a savings account, it looks like the max APY you can get at Huntington is .25%. That's no bueno. Ally is at 2.2%. So say you had $10,000 to put in a savings account. After one year with Huntington, you'd earn an extra $25 in interest. After one year with Ally, you'd earn an extra $220 in interest.

I assume at your age, this is all you'll be using it for. So if you don't mind not having access to a physical bank, then ally is a no-brainer."
Quan-Su-Dude,"Pause retirement contributions (except for the employer match). Pay down student loans. Fully fund your emergency fund. Save up for a higher down payment - at least 20% to avoid PMI. Put that savings in a CD or a high yield savings account. Don't invest it in a brokerage account. 

Pausing retirement contributions outside the match isn't going to hurt you. You're VERY young and WAY ahead of 99% of people your age. You have plenty of time to contribute to retirement. Good on you for doing it early."
Quan-Su-Dude,"0% financing is a great deal and there's no reason to pay it all up front if you're comfortable with it. It's much wiser to throw your whole bonus at your car debt, that is actively accruing interest.

All that said, I was in your exact position 5 years ago. My advice is to buy the bare essentials in terms of furniture. Nothing fancy. As excited as you are, there are a lot of variables that may come in the next 12-24 months of your life. What if you get burned out at your job after 12 months and you move back home? What if you get laid off? What if a new job you get requires you to move to another part of the city? What if you get homesick? What if you just decide this city isn't for you? What if you meet someone and you decide to move in to a new place together? What if they just think your taste in furniture is terrible? Finance essential, **reasonably priced** furniture at 0% while you pay off your car loan. That is my two cents."
Quan-Su-Dude,"Good on you for having the emergency fund.

Yes, pay off your car in full (as well as any credit card/student loans) before investing further. You're not building wealth if you still have debt. If you can contribute up to the match of your 401k while paying off debt, do it. It's free money. if not, not a big deal to pause contributions for a couple years."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Get dates and times down. 

We spoke on my salary when I was rotated from hourly to salary and you noted that we would revisit my pay annually.

should be

Please recall on Date-X, when I rotated from hourly to salary, we *agreed* to revisit my pay annually.

Employment is a two-way street. Owner's loyalty is only as good as the money you bring in. Anything said otherwise is fluff.

Bullet point accomplishments. Be considerate of the owner's time.

I'd love to meet with you and discuss current/future compensation and formulate a general gameplan for the foreseeable future.

No. During negotiations you need to offer alternatives ALWAYS.

Would after Friday's weekly meeting work to discuss increasing my salary or would Monday at 2pm work? State your purpose, offer choices.

You give someone a choice, and they suddenly feel in charge (again). Asking for more money always puts someone on the defensive no matter how much provide. That's the way of the world. Think how you feel when Netflix ups their rate to $14 per month or whatever. But when Netflix says ""You can go premium for $14, or if you prefer stay with your plan for $12 blah blah.""

tldr; You're spot on for listing accomplishments. Shorten this up. Get ready to offer choices. Finally, be prepared to put your updated skills to work if the owner says ""nope, looming recession, honeybees dying off."" Be ready to negotiate. If no more pay, then get some vacation time. Always be thankful, professional, courteous...and look out for number one. Asking for more pay, by default means more responsibility or you are actively looking for employment elsewhere. COL is another matter entirely and can be approached a bit more informally."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Don't do it unless you have relatives or good friends you can crash with. Moving across the country isn't like an extended vacation. Any place to rent will want to have either a pay stub in hand or a colossal down payment. ETA: source: Moved across the country, stayed with a friend who said it would be cool while I looked for work. He decided to quit smoking when I moved in...for whatever reason. I didn't care one way or the other that he smoked. IDK if you ever met someone who is quitting smoking cold turkey, but it was an adventure. I was lucky enough to land a job a few weeks after moving. But again...things were dicey and I wouldn't want to do that again."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Hi end apartments are all brochure and little lifestyle. Anyone soaking up the amenities is going to be old and retired and a fixture around the pool. It would be better to rent cheaper and join a gym. As far as downtown walking distance is concerned: Spend a few weeks down there in a hotel before deciding where to live. You will find, unlike college, every night isn't a party night. Friday nights and weekends will be an Uber away on those days. Look at it this way: Even if the downtown area *is* party central, would you want to come home from work tired and in need of sleep and have to put up with the ruckus?

Listen to your parents. They are footing some bills; you're moving away from them by thousands of miles. At least allow them the idea that they are looking after you from afar. You worked your ass off...I'm sure that work ethic was learned somewhere.

Live a little, but always keep in mind: Rent is throwing money away. you don't need to live in a shack in the swamp (unless that's your kink), but dreaming of lounging by the pool after work grows old fast. As does the gym with bare bones equipment. The lounge? Be prepared to deal with the apartment lounge lizards. The apartment has *shared* amenities...and not everyone always plays nice. It's not like owning your own pool, in your own backyard, with your own BBQ that some jackass didn't forget to clean."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"It's been too long since statistical analysis in college, but you don't need to verify every one, you just need coordinated random sample sets in addition to criteria that would be considered ""red flags"" to auditing a return. Too high a differential in income from previous filings, change of filing status, change of address. Hopefully an IRS goon will give us the scoop."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"The divorce decree signed by a judge determines who gets to claim you and your sister. How do you know your mom got ""screwed"" financially, btw? Did you find your dad weeping over a microwave dinner, begging for your forgiveness for doing that? Or did your mom casually mention you don't get an XBox game because she got ""screwed financially"" and will not get an IRS tax return this year?

Listen kid, the next time either of your parents starts ragging on the other parent in front of you, regardless if the other parent is present to even hear what is being said, you tell them to shut their damned yaps because divorce is hard enough on you and your sister as it is. You don't need to be privy of where the money is going or not going. The only thing needing to be dumped on your shoulders is unconditional love by both parents. This isn't really something for personal finance...but a divorce sticky should be up there somewhere. Divorce is a brutal financial setback for all parties involved."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Here is what would happen if you move: You either need tons of income to get into an apartment that allows pets, or you move out to an affordable place with roommates and the dog stays home with your abusive sister.

Calling animal control or telling the vet is just going to escalate the situation and make things worse. Let your parents handle disciplining your sister over the dog. As others have pointed out, you're not in a position to strike out on your own.

If anything, dealing with your sister will prepare you for the loads of shitheads that will do stupid stuff daily. Shitty neighbors, shitty bosses, shitty coworkers, etc. You can't go around slapping people that act shitty...as much as we would all like to.

Focus on school, furthering your education, and eventually moving out. Your parents are in the right, here. Had you just alerted them to your sister hitting the dog, or you yourself showing restraint when an animal (your sister) misbehaves you don't hit them, she may have learned from example.

Shitty advice follows: We live in the digital age. Your sister slaps the dog, you don't threaten her with ""How would you like it if I slapped you."" First, see if you can't get between them to stop it. That's non-shitty advice. The shitty advice is to record her doing it and threaten to make her go viral. That's where we are as a society. Seems to deter people."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Wouldn't it be nice to hire a company to dig a well then get a septic tank and give the city the finger as you also collect rain water off the roof and dig a nice pond out back to retain more water.

Not helpful info, I know. Hindsight is 20/20, next tenant you charge for the water.

It makes zero sense to me that the city can refuse to give you a service that is required to live (almost everything on Earth requires water). But this is the world we live in nowadays. Water rights will only get trickier as time goes on."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"It's a studio. There is no spare room. There is no second bedroom. There is no bedroom. There's a kitchen area, a bathroom with a door, maybe a closet, and an open area. ETA: OP may not have mentioned it was a studio in his original post, but later in a response. That said, the idea that someone was renting a 3 bedroom apartment anywhere in the vicinity of 20 minutes to NYC for $1700 is straight up whackadoo. Something like that is going to go for 3-5k minimum, and likely more."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Go 12% above what they offered, explaining your value and what you bring to the table and what new responsibilities you're looking to take on. Have a list of also-demands that you can counter to when they come back coughing and choking and saying they have nothing to spare. Then counter again with 5-10% over what they offered, in addition to 3 Fridays off in December, or immediate 401k matching or work from home from time to time, what-have-you. It's business; they expect you to negotiate. ""I appreciate the offer, but also know the going rate for this job is 50-75. I see myself in the upper tier of that pay grade, because I shit gold nuggets from time to time. I'm willing to go to 70k because...gold nuggets. We can discuss this in person next Tuesday or Wednesday, whichever works for you."""
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Sure it won't die because real estate ownership, over the long haul, makes sense. The market can fluctuate all it wants. Once you have a mortgage, that's your set price for 30 years. Housing is now back to pre bubble prices...but whatever. Keep your mindset as I need renters for my properties :)"
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"Of course you pay for upkeep. The difference is the roof lasts 30 years. The appliances last 10-20 years. Water heaters, furnaces last 10-30 years. I'd rather spend 5k on an AC, or 10k on a roof once in a blue moon and have my own parking, not be subject to ""inspections"" by a landlord, not have to deal with the headaches of noise.

Most people would rather have their own 4 walls. Downvote away, reddit is the millenial commie bastion."
GHOSTofROIDBOT,"They can't exclude you, otherwise they are discriminating. So you are as normal as they come. My career took a big hit being a divorced father with kids and zero help from their mother. I'm a little bitter that Google has yet to make a banner for the single dads with their pockets turned inside out saying ""I just don't have it."" That's how it goes. 

Given the disparity of COL, and that you need to question reddit vs HR about moving necessities like housing/COL/car/pets...does it make sense to take your son with you for only a year of school, btw? Anyway, you might want to re-evaluate your priorities vs opportunity. Engineers anywhere in the US are in short supply. One of the best zings I got was on a recruiter who called me from across the country for a job. Did a phone interview. Did another skype interview. Recruiter got to negotiation on salary, and didn't want to budge, even though that side of the country costs double. Her excuse was she could find an engineer local for the meager pay. I told her to go shake some trees and pick and choose from all the engineers that fall out from them. 

tldr; if you don't want to go, don't. If you do, hammer all that out and don't fall for the ""amazing opportunity"" schtick. They need you there for a reason. You should be compensated accordingly. And whatever you do, don't bring your dog or private school into the mix. Those things are personal. Figure out the cost, then present the figure as what it will cost them to move you."
degening,"Where did you get a loan at 49% from? No legitimate bank would do that. Are these legal loans or something you got from a guy who knows people? There is just no way these things are legit. 


You need to find a better job...or even 2 better jobs, you are barely making over minimum wage for the hours you are working.

Depending on who you actually owe the money too you should consult a bankruptcy attorney to see if that is an option.

A lot about this story if very suspect though."
degening,"You should look into Dave Ramsey's FPU class if you want to learn more about personal finance. 

If I can be honest with you though your post is just riddled with self pitty and excuses. You cant afford to move out. Period. Your husband is making ~$10/hr and you don't work. If you truly cant work you need to apply for disability. If you've been denied before then there is probably a reason. Dave's program is the best place for some one with very little knowledge but it wont make a difference if you and your husband cant learn to cope with life and make some hard choices."
degening,"You should be paying cash for a car. You only have $600 in expenses per month and make 2400, with 4000 coming in a few months. i'd drive the Buick till then and find something with the cash I have on hand at that point. 

Going into debt on a depreciating asset with a very high interest rate when you don't have to is never going to be a good idea."
degening,"You make 12k per year which, as you put, is enough to survive but doubling it to 24k would be nothing? Think you have a perspective issue here bud no so much a financial one. Might want to take a break from the drugs, or get some better ones.

This is also mainly a US sub so specific advice might be hard to come buy for someone in eastern Europe."
degening,"First off yes you need to pay the medical debt. It was part of the estate and the estate is where she got the 200k from so she does owe it.


Second on what to do with the money, well probably nothing tbh. Your mom doesn't have enough money to be retired and it doesn't sound like she can work so we have a bit of an issue here. She really cant afford to take any risks with the money as losing even 10% could mean shes broke a whole year before she otherwise would be. Need to find out how much she is getting from your dad's retirement and when does she plan to take social security and how much will she get. I know she is living with family now with 'no real expenses' but lets not assume that is a long term possibility, she could live another 30 years after all."
degening,"Ahh ok gotcha. Yes you can make a more tax efficient profile with individual stocks compared to the sp500. However you are giving up diversification which will likely greatly out weigh any theoretical tax savings. Your transaction costs are also going to be much higher unless you have a lot of money(like on the order of 10-100million) 


All in all the sp500 is fairly tax efficient as is and I personally would just stick with it"
degening,"American Funds are expensive by indexing standards but they've done well overtime. If you compare their funds to the appropriate index you'll see they arent that much different(in terms of holdings). 


You could have done worse. I would switch to vanguard and go with a target retirement fund if I were in your shoes."
degening,"The fees reported are the only fees you pay and therefore take into account any fees of underlying funds already. So in this case the fees are 2.72% as listed.


That being said 2.72% is extremely high for what is essentially 50% sp500 and 50% non us stock. Would never buy this fund."
degening,"Annuities aren't inherently bad, but very unlikely to have been a proper investment for you. You can transfer your ira to a place like vanguard and, depending on what is in the annuity contract, move the money into a more suitable fund, like a target date fund."
degening,"If you are looking for a tax efficient and growth orientated approach I would go with either a sp500 fund or total market fund(they are nearly identical). 

As for taxes you will have to pay yearly based on any realized gains(dividends or if you sell). No getting away from this, its just how taxable investing works. In fact even a savings account would produce taxable gains."
degening,Bonds go up and down based on interest rates. So since interest rates are rising it will cost companies more to borrow money and therefore offer a higher interest rate on bonds they sell. Bond interest rates will always(basically) be higher than T-bills to account for the added risk.
degening,"Are you still in high school? Sounds like it is you are saying you have years of college still. Most college freshman change their major like 5 times so I would slow down a bit here and take a step back.

Your first year of a mechanical engineering degree in going to be a lot of classes that you should have access to in any school. I would try and get through my first year in the computer science program before I made any change. 

Classes that you should be looking to take if you think you will go for mechanical engineering at college A would be:
Calculus 1 and 2(maybe calc 3 as well over summer)
Physics 1 and 2 This is the calc based physics not what you took in high school.
History, English ect Just some of the basics
These should always transfer and if they don't I would be worried about the school anyway."
degening,"Do you have any money? Your car is about to die and you are going to need to do something but you done make a lot of money. You should be saving as much as you possibly can right now expecting to have to buy a car very soon. You should be looking to pay cash for something cheap, at 19 you likely have no credit and don't want to be stuck in the terrible car loan cycle you are likely headed toward."
degening,"Feeling like you deserve something that you cant actually pay for is how a lot of people end up broke. Its not cheesy its stupid. Think about it, you drove a $3500 car for 6 years and in that time only saved up 6k. Probably a lot of other things in there you thought you deserved.

You should buy something that you can pay cash for, only needs to last you a few years, and then save for something nicer."
degening,"That's true. But often times if they are underwater then the car was likely to expensive for them in the first place. Think of someone making 30k per year driving a 30k car. This person would be better off just getting away from the debt and the car and getting something more reasonable for their income. Again this still all assumes they can get away. 

And you shouldn't look at it as 'having something to show for it'. A person with a 20k car, 10k in cash and a 30k car loan doesn't have nothing to show for getting rid of the car, they are moving to a much less leveraged position."
degening,"If you had $4k in the bank and no student loans would you go out and borrow $18k at 5.84% to stick it in the bank? That's basically what you are doing right now. If you are feeling financially vulnerable then getting rid of debt should make you feel better. $4000 is a decent emergency fund for a 2 income family. Ask yourself, what is a realistic emergency that $4000 wouldn't cover and how likely is that to happen? Not saying there aren't any because there definitely are, but you aren't going to sit at a $4k ef forever. 


Its hard to pull the trigger but I would pay it off in your shoes."
degening,"As a consumer of personal finance related things(blogs, youtube channels, ect) the problem I see is that there just isn't that much content to be made. Personal finance doesn't change with time really and you'll either end up with nothing to talk about or repeating yourself.

So idk if its worth it, that's going to be a personal choice. If you can repackage things in an interesting way you can get some followers but where will it lead after you are out of things related to finance to talk about depends a lot on you."
degening,"Even when you don't have the forms on time filing your taxes is still 100% your responsibility. That's important to understand here.

You can ask them to cover fees as the worst they can say is no. If you want to go further you can sue and argue their actions caused you damages. If you go that route you need to talk to an attorney to see if it is at all viable in your scenario. 

So ask them to cover the fees and sue if they say no. Those are your options."
degening,"If you are taking it as a loan you will have to disclose that to the mortgage lender and it might even prevent you from being approved. If you take it as a gift and don't report it to the irs, even though no tax is owed today, you are committing fraud."
degening,"Whether or not to get a consolidation loan is just a math problem - can she get a lower interest rate basically.

But lets be real, she doesn't have a math problem she has a behavior problem. She has already gone down this path once before, consolidating ccs to get out of the debt. It didn't work because she never took responsibility to get out of debt. And she has basically done the same thing again by 'relinquishing' control to you to fix her problem. You need to understand that YOU CANNOT FIX THIS PROBLEM. She has to. And she has to want to fix it. You can help by working through things with her but she needs to change the behavior that has put her here. 

I would recommend going through Dave Ramsey's class with her. It will teach her how to be better with money and will be a way for you two to get on the same page financially. 


So sure get a 2nd consolidation loan if she can and it makes sense, but understand that she's drowning man. She doesn't need to move to another pool she need to get out of the fucking water."
degening,It is possible that this debt belonged to your father and the collection agency has a right to try and collect from his estate. I would just send it to the executor and let him deal with it. Wouldn't even bother calling the agency.
degening,"The insurance is easy, just get a quote of what it will cost you to get a similar plan to what other companies in your field offer.

The 401k is a bit harder to pin down. Again you can look at your field and look at the average matching portion, lets just say its 5%, and add 5% to your compensation. You would then need to add the benefit of the tax advantaged space itself, which is much harder to do.



All in all if a comparable salary with benefits is 60k I'm asking for 80k and taking 72k at the low end."
degening,"If you bought the individual stocks in the same proportion as held in the index fund the dividends and taxes would be the same. If you are holding these in a retirement account then taxes would still be 0 until you withdraw. If you want higher dividend yield there are funds for that.

Better question is why do you want more dividends in the first place? You aren't getting anything extra for getting a dividend."
degening,"This is one of the reasons I prefer vanguard, don't want to be buying people free-bees with money I paid to invest there. Although tbh if I started at shwab and not vanguard idk if id bother to switch.

Anyway grats the yeti, that was nice of them to send it to you."
degening,"Well if everyone else there averages 15-18 I would want the same or at least a path to get to that rate. If everyone else there has 10 years experience and you only had 2 for example I wouldn't expect to be at the same rate, but you should be able to get to that rate within a reasonable amount of time."
degening,"Yea I wouldn't feel comfortable with that much debt either. The 35k car loan is just way to much for your income level. If you aren't underwater you should look into selling it and moving to a much cheaper car until you at least have the student loan paid off.

You are also only saving 3% towards retirement which is way to low, want to be a lot closer to 15%. 

Good news is you're young. Bad news is you are making typical broke people mistakes with money(the car and no retirement)."
badpizzaisstillgood,"Yes you can afford a Tesla and it won't be anywhere near $60k unless you are also getting auto pilot(which is very overrated and not worth the $9k upgrade or w/e it is). 

Just get the regular long range one that I think is $49k - federal/state tax break.

The general rule is 35% of your annual salary max but you have your shit together so yes you can go over that. Don't let any turds tell you ""hurdudrr doN't BuY a DepreCiatiNg AsseT."" Go enjoy life, it's an awesome car and is a reasonable ""enjoyment"" purchase for where you are at financially."
badpizzaisstillgood,"Her names on it so yes you can. 

And if it was a join bank account I believe she has the right to all the money in it so hope it wasn't a large amount and uhhh don't get joint accounts unless it's a spouse."
badpizzaisstillgood,"Of course they won't approve you for a loan if your income is between $7.2k-$9.6k assuming you work a full year and since you are young you probably have very little credit history so score doesn't mean much. Would you loan a couple thousand dollars to a college student that makes no money? 

There's nothing you can do if your parents don't co-sign the loan. Any reason why they won't? As long as you make the payments it won't affect them.. and it's not like you are on bad terms if they are paying for your school.

Other than that just save $1000-$2000 and buy whatever you can with cash."
badpizzaisstillgood,"If you can't max your 401k(19k) for 25 years + have a decent amount of taxable investments you can't retire in your 40's. 

23-45 $19k contribution w/ 7% roi would only net $940k which is nowhere near enough if you retire that early.

So the only real answer is maxing your 401k + having other investments as well."
badpizzaisstillgood,"Doesn't matter both will return about the same since target date funds is just a mix of US/International/Bonds, you can google to see what the percentages of each allocation is to determine which you prefer but if you did google that you could also just easily buy the funds separately and allocate it yourself for a lower expense ratio. 

A difference of 0.07% in expense ratio is pretty much nothing ($70 per $100k) but like I said you can allocate the percentages yourself with the exact same holdings and get it down to 0.04 w/ Vanguard or 0 w/ Fidelity. 

And no you can't lose all your money with either of these when it's held till retirement, if you do we have a much bigger problem than money probably means some nukes are going off or a meteor hit us."
badpizzaisstillgood,"Well you are married to her so get rid of her high % cc debt.

Your car+insurance is really high for your wages($35k+ truck?) but looks like you are doing good enough elsewhere that it shouldn't be that big of an issue."
badpizzaisstillgood,"How are they going to get another house if they sell it to you for less than market value?

If it's worth $312k and they have $60k on the loan they will have $252k of equity towards a new home."
badpizzaisstillgood,"Way over-complicating it just pick one fund and contribute that for the year whether it's lump sum or payments throughout the year. Then choose something else the next year if you want to change it up.

30+ years of contributions is already DCA no point in changing where your allocations go every month.

Or to make it even easier you can just contribute everything towards 1 fund and reallocate however you want once a year since you don't get any penalties for buying/selling funds in your IRA."
badpizzaisstillgood,"At the very least if his company has a match on the 401k just tell him that is literally free money and even if the market crashes 50% he'll have his original balance.

As far as investing anything beyond that he sounds pretty looney if he is getting information from YouTube so not much you can do on that end lol.

Your brother doesn't have a financial problem he has a mental/conspiracy theory problem."
badpizzaisstillgood,"If you bought it brand new a few months back then you are already upside down on the loan and probably down a few thousand already. 

If you bought it used than yeah you can try to sell it for around what you got it for and get a used truck instead."
badpizzaisstillgood,"Regardless you need a personal checking account **somewhere** on top of Ally so you might as well get a **regular** chase checking account instead of premier. 

You don't need free cashiers checks, foreign atm fees, or any of those benefits anyways. 

Just get regular, set your direct deposits to it, and transfer to Ally whenever you have an amount that you want to move. And yeah having a chase account makes it simpler to keep track of your finances since you already have your cards through them."
tunfey,"I understand you don't want to go through the pharmacy program, but did you take that loan and use it?  If you did take it and used it, you should be responsible for your share.  I echo others on you can ask for a lot of things but whether they give it to you is another.  They may be willing to work out longer pay back term, but forgiving the entire loan seems unlikely."
tunfey,"Don’t hurt to ask and appeal to their compassion but I won’t hold my breath though.  Do you have another place you are moving into after June? If so, maybe you can explore with your new landlord to see if you can move in early to avoid transitions between Airbnb and your new residence."
tunfey,"Debt control and savings is about behaviour changes. You mention you have about $4k in savings, which barely covers your basic expense (excluding food) for 3 months. Maybe you can look into setting up automatic savings with a set target for monthly savings. Start small (ie 100-200 a month), as soon as you get paid, take that money out and put it into a savings account and forbid yourself from touching it unless it is emergency. As you get more comfortable with your savings number you can slowly adjust that amount up. This way, what you have left to spend becomes “less” as you pay yourself first."
tunfey,Good to see you take the first step to independence.  I am sure you parents will be willing to help you for however long. Do you have a game plan to allow yourself become self sufficient after you have moved out?
tunfey,"Do you enjoy your line of work and are ok to do that during all of your free time while you are in school? Now imagine repeating this for decades when you are out of school. If you enjoy spending all your time on working for material goods and enjoyment, that’s fine. It’s personal preference and lifestyle choice. There is nothing wrong with that. 🙂

If you are looking to change. Maybe you can think of things you buy as an investment. The nice bag / cloths you invest in now will only depreciate as they go out of season. However, if you save the money from your PT work, it will appreciate (ie interest, dividends, cap gains etc) or itcan be used to invest in yourself in the form of education (tuition payment).

I guess all I am trying to say is “money can buy many things but nothing more valuable than your freedom”.  Good luck! 👍"
tunfey,"It's good that you are wanting to help your parents out.  Who's going to be responsible for the down payment in this transaction?  If it is all on you, is owning a property part of your plan? If so and you feel you can take care of all the bills alone, then why not buy the property alone and rent it out to your parents?  In essence, they are still paying the monthly bills and get to live in a house.  If they pull out and can't pay the rent, you can still rent it to someone else and are somewhat covered.  If owning a property is not part of your plan and you don't feel you can handle the bills alone, then it's not a good idea to sign in on the deal with them.  Like others have commented here, they have a history of bad credit (bankruptcy) and can easy pull out.  If they do pull out on you, you will be left to foot all the bills and yet still be entitled to their share of payout if the property sells."
tunfey,"This is truly sad, I am sorry to hear you are put through this; especially by someone that is so close to you.  I think you should tell the authorities the truth.  If she can do it to you once, she can do it to you again.  Who knows how many other credit applications she has done under your name by now.  Report her will help save yourself and correct her despicable behavior.  It's not worth it to go bankrupt for debts created by someone else.  Let the court decide what should happen. Stay strong!"
tunfey,"Here is the link to the Fidelity article  [https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire) 

It actually lays out how much an individual should have saved at various ages.  I don't think it takes into account what people's lifestyle and spending is like, so take it with a grain of salt.

Good luck!"
tunfey,"I think a house will be a better bet, at least it did retain value (assuming a major correction like 2008/2009 don’t happen again any time soon). Like you have said, the truck is not a necessity and your current car still works. We have a an old Honda as well 2009 and it works great 👍"
tunfey,"Will this $1k help pay off her car loan completely? If this is only 1 of many payments on the car loan, I did say don’t do it. It’s not even about whether you will get your money back, it’s more that if she can’t afford it now she won’t be able to for future payments. Best to cut her “lost” short before she is in too deep. This will also be a lessons learned for her in the future to assess before getting into situations too. Tough love I suppose."
tunfey,"If you are worried about all eggs in one basket, as an option, you may consider sell a portion of it and put them into an index fund. Index funds aims to match market and offers diversification. Good luck! 👍"
tunfey,"It’s personal preference and what you did be comfortable with. For me, i am not comfortable having too many eggs in one basket.  So I try to keep any single holdings down to less than 25% of the overall portfolio holdings. God luck! 👍"
tunfey,"I get what you mean in collecting the points though cuz I do the same thing hahah...but ya, use the lower interest credit to pay it off...psychologically, it may feel better to have 1 debt than 2 separate ones. Good luck and hope all goes well health wise 👍"
ScottishTrader,"One way to get started in real estate is to buy a house, perhaps a double or duplex where you rent out one side and live in the other.  If you look around you may find a house that has ""Mother-in-law"" quarters or even a smaller house on the same lot.  These are not usually attractive to most ""regular"" home buyers, so can be bought for less than you may think, then rent out the space to help pay for the mortgage.

Renting a bedroom in your personal space can be a challenge, and a friend can work but also may be the best way to destroy that friendship.  You may be reluctant to throw them out if they don't pay rent or don't follow the rules, more than paying the mortgage you have to protect the investment you made buying the house.

Being a landlord can be tough and you will want to have a signed lease that spells out what the tenant (friend or not) is to do and what the consequences are.  Lease templates are widely available online that you can customize.  For someone you don't know a background check can also be ordered online for a modest fee, do this to be sure you know who you are dealing with!

Looking ahead, when all is said and done, and provided you manage this well, you can end up with a good part of the mortgage (if not all!) being paid by the renter and can save up to buy your next and nicer home and may even keep the house to rent out for income.  Over time as the rental house gets paid down and appreciates in value, you may find you can sell it for a nice chunk of cash.

I've successfully done this and there are others on here who likely have as well, so don't hesitate to reach out with any questions.   If this is your first house it can be a bit scary, but once you've bought and sold 8 or 10 properties you will be very comfortable with the process.  Best of luck!"
ScottishTrader,"Learn something new and become good at it, maybe even become an expert at it!

Preferably this is something you like, maybe are passionate about, and it is nice if it leads to making money or at least helps others or makes the world a better place.

I know a young man who worked at a liquor store in the evenings but learned about being an electrician on his free time and eventually ended up getting a job as an electrician apprentice.  He completed that and is now a full fledged electrician in a union making a great living.  He wanted to be an electrician and a better job so he pursued this to invest in himself on his own until he achieved his goal. 

Taking classes can help, reading books or taking online courses are good, but being self driven to pursue constant life long learning is what I think it means.  Each time you learn something new it is investing in yourself.

Note that this can also mean exercising to be healthy and seeing the doctor and dentist.  Best to you and go learn something new today!"
ScottishTrader,"Try buying for cash and then making some improvements you might want to do anyway, and then have it reappraised to refinance,  Some years ago I did this and was able to pull out my entire investment after about 6 months due to the increased appraisal value.  

Just a thought."
ScottishTrader,"The least expensive car is usually the one you already own, but that may not be the case here.

Some logic questions you need to ask are:

\- How critical is this car for your job or personal needs?  If critical find a car with lower miles in better shape.

\- What will it cost to get the car up to where it is safe?  Tires are critical, a muffler is likely very important for carbon monoxide reasons, shocks, and springs for handling to not cause a crash in an emergency maneuver would seem to be what needs to be done right away.  This is about $1,000, how much more about this would it take to find a reliable car with lower miles? 

\- The oil leak is a cost and an environmental thing that will only get worse.

Once you address the logic side of this to determine if another care makes sense, then address the emotional side of wanting a nicer car to drive (don't we all!).

You don't say much about your financial situation other than that you have the cash to buy a new car, so if that is the case then go find something that fits in your budget and buy it."
ScottishTrader,"Speak to a reputable lawyer, but these can be set up for anyone to my knowledge.  

While I dislike them and think they are expensive, look into an annuity where a certain amount is deposited and then the company guarantees an income for life.  This also makes it so that the principal is not available to be spent frivolously.

The other thing I was thinking about is that this is your MIL's money to do with as she pleases.  So if she wants a trust or annuity then do it, but if she doesn't then let her spend the money as she sees fit even if you don't like it . . ."
ScottishTrader,"Keep in mind that a FA will work to not lose you money but not work to beat the market either.  They know if they make higher risk investments with higher returns but lose your money you will leave, so they just take the middle road of safe and average returns.  What they will put your money in are funds that give them a kick back or send them on a fancy trip.

You can do much better on your own.  Open a Fidelity account, either IRA or taxable, and use their tools to find a mix of funds and quality stocks that pay a nice dividend to make the same, and very likely a better return without paying someone a good percentage of your account to do the same or worse.

No one, NO ONE, will handle your money better than you. You’re obviously smart so can do a much better job.

Yes, you should buy a house as it is a great investment and not a waste of money that renting is.  Then, if it makes sense you may want to buy an investment property and have a management company run it for you so it is turn key and hands off but will bring in cash flow plus will appreciate over time.

The emotions get better when you have a trading or investing plan, time really doesn’t have anything to do with it.  Before going into a trade or investment set your goals and thresholds for profit or loss points where you will close.  Having a plan is what separates a beginner who has losses and unpredictable result from an advanced investor who has more predictable and profitable results.     

Lastly, stop listening to those who are foretelling the market crashing!  No one can tell when this will happen!  Let me repeat, no one can tell when this will happen, and those who have been trading or making investments in anticipation of a crash have missed one of the biggest bull markets in history!  If you are a stats kind of person you know that the odds of a market crash do not increase just because there has not been one in a while.  Besides, most downturns are short and at age 33 you will have many years to recover from any potential downturn.  In fact some of the most money I ever made was after 08/09 when I bought great stocks cheap as everyone else was dumping them!  Just tune out the noise and make a plan that includes sensible quality investments, and if you want to play some speculative plays like weed stocks the set aside some play money you are fine losing."
ScottishTrader,"6 months of living expenses are what your emergency fund should be.  Look at a CD or other interest-bearing account to earn at least a little while it is sitting.

Once you get beyond this amount letting cash sit is a drag as inflation will usually impact it, so consider some well thought out and conservative investments.  Be sure you do have a retirement account setup and funded as well."
ScottishTrader,"There is really not enough info to give any good reply.

What might you need this money for?

Do you have other bills or debts?

Do you have an emergency fund?

Start a business is a big undertaking that will require a lot of time and has a big risk, so this is not a casual choice.

How old are you?  

What do you do now?

Why don't you want to buy a house?  This is a great investment even if you don't live in it forever.

&amp;#x200B;

A Roth IRA would be great if you don't need your money between now and age 59.5.

Some conservative stocks that pay nice dividends may work if you have some time and are willing to take some risk.

A business can be a good idea if you have a good business plan and some expertise in what you want to do, but $10K is not usually enough to properly capitalize even the smallest businesses."
ScottishTrader,"Thank you for pointing this out.  As an engineer, in both profession and through process, I am not always as sensitive to how seemingly logical and unemotional statements may come across.

ScottishTrader,"Talk to a reputable lawyer about setting up a trust account that can give a monthly amount and they have trust accounts at banks that will sensibly invest the money as part of the trust.  Speak to the lawyer, and you may need to engage a CPA, to manage the tax aspects.  

Depending on her financial needs and age this could last her for the rest of her life.

My 2 cents and voice of experience is that I would not recommend you manage this money as it can cause a lot of tension in your family.  Also, I'd recommend against a financial advisor as they play for minimal returns but take a check of the money, and this would not prevent her from accessing the money.  Get the trust set up as noted above using a reputable bank who will take care of it all."
ScottishTrader,"This is right.  If you have shares you've owned for &gt;1 year think about selling those (you should be able to specify what shares get sold) so that you get taxed at the lower cap gain rate meaning you should not get ""killed in taxes"".  There are other factors, but it should be 10%, or at most 15%, but may vary based on your personal situation and tax rates, etc.  

Buying a home is an amazing investment that offers some tax breaks and should continue to grow in value, so you are moving from one type of investment to another even better one, so this is a good thing to do even if you owe some taxes.  This is a good trade-off.

Find a CPA who will take your call for this one quick question, but I expect there is no way to take assets from the ESPP stock trade to buy a house and not pay taxes or pay less.  Please post what you find and congrats on the pending purchase of a house!"
ScottishTrader,"Yes, but it depends on the value of the car vs what is owed.  You may find that even paying a few hundred dollars to get rid of the car and loan to free up some extra cash will be helpful.

If the car is worth $15K and the loan is $12K then there is $3K of the money you owe.  Or, you can use that money to buy a basic car and no longer have a payment."
ScottishTrader,"If you will not have “customers” coming to this location you should be just fine and is no different than working from home.

Even if you have a co-worker or 2 quietly come over once in a while it should be no issue provided there are no parking or noise issues.

However, if you will have a stream of customers or co-workers coming to this “office” then it will be in violation of zoning and the neighbors will complain so it will not work."
ScottishTrader,"You can plan and organize your way out of this.  It may require a part-time job, making lunches and not spending anything on fun activities or pursuits for a while.

Pay off the smallest creditor first, then use that money to pay off the next one and so on.

Some good news is that once you pull yourself out of this you will never get in this position again, will know the power of organization and planning, plus find out that you are capable of doing anything you set your mind to!  Best of luck!"
ScottishTrader,"This is easy and simple:

1- Pay off all your credit card balance each and every month by the due date!

2- In the event of a ""true"" real emergency where you have to carry a balance, pay it off by making the highest payment amounts by the due date as soon as humanly possible!

By always making all your payments by the due date, utilities, car payments, doctor bills and credit cards you will gain good credit and won't have to worry about your score as it will be naturally high.  

Even one late payment will negatively affect your score!

Start with a small credit line on a big name card like Capital One, Chase or Wells Fargo, or if your bank or credit union offers a card this may be a good alternative.

Stay away from the specialty cards at first, you do not need points, hotels, or airline miles, or anything else as you get going.  Once you manage your first card well you will have more offers than you know what to do with and can decide if a specialty card will make sense for you.

How you manage your credit will offer a huge benefit to accomplish what you want to do in life, or can be a giant barrier to getting what you want and need.  Just always, always, make every payment on time and you will not need any of the credit gimmicks like the apps that tell you your score every minute of every day."
ScottishTrader,"I'm older but still use the free Bill Pay through my CU and then also track every bill and payment in a simple spreadsheet that totals it all up.

Between the online webpage/app I know exactly how much I have in the account plus what is coming up to be paid and when.  With the spreadsheet, I know how much I paid for each bill, plus how much was paid for any category (utilities, food, cars, etc.) each month, and then this totals up for the year.

Something that may help is based on what is required each month to pay the bills, to take a cash allowance of any extra each week or paycheck to spend on eating out or discretionary expenses.  When the cash is gone then stop spending!  You may find you can save some of your allowances from prior weeks to help save for a special event of something you want to do.

Organization and planning will set you free!  Setup the bill pay, get the app and make the simple spreadsheet and then use them to track everything down to the penny that you can see at any moment of every day.  Best of luck to you!"
ScottishTrader,"It is a Bill Pay service they provide at no cost to members.  It can be set up a few different ways, from the bill sent and paid automatically thru the service to setting up the company and then manually entering the amount and due date.  I mostly use the latter as I am a self confessed control enthusiast and want to ""approve"" every transaction, but I am slowly working towards just letting it be automatic.

What this means is it takes me a couple minutes per month to pay all the bills."
ScottishTrader,"Sounds like the best thing to do that will put you in a better financial position is sell the car and so doing this with any resource available will likely make sense.

The cleaner way may be to get a cash advance on the CC and then pay down the car loan so that when the dealer buys it there is no added complication with any other loan.  Selling the stock options can work if you are able to pay this back over time and buying the stock to replace what was lost.  Note that this will incur a taxable event so be sure to account for that.

Do the math to see how much you will save not having the car, then how much you can pay back the CC or stocks and then set that course to follow and do it.  

Life is all about making changes and adjustments to continually put yourself in a better financial position!"
ScottishTrader,"I understand your view, but as a property owner who has had to spend thousands of dollars to repair a trashed apartment after having to evict someone who didn't pay rent for months, this is standard and necessary.

If you are buying a car or house don't you expect your credit to be checked?

If you're applying for a job where you work with kids or seniors, don't you expect your background to be checked?

Sorry, but whether you hate it or not this is the way of society."
ScottishTrader,"If you don't set up a trust there is nothing to stop her from pulling money whenever she wishes.

But, if you are the gatekeeper that needs to sign off or approve any withdrawals then it will end badly.

Set it up as a trust with a reasonable allowance so she can live comfortably, but make the lawyers be the bad guys if she wants to spend more."
ScottishTrader,"I've worked 1099 off and on for years, and the thing to keep in mind is that in a ""regular"" job the employer takes the taxes out in every paycheck so it adds up over time so it can be a surprise when the amount is shown as one lump sum.  As a self-employed person, you own both sides of the SSN taxes, which should amount to an extra 7.5% as you were already paying one side, now have to pay both.

If you do not know taxes well then speak to your tax pro to ask what works for your situation, there are too many variables and you don't want to listen to strangers on the internet for this type of advice."
ScottishTrader,"I've not found a way to convince someone who passionately believes in something that it may not be the reality.  In fact, the more they are pushed the more they resist . . .

Here is what I would recommend to you.  Set an example and if it comes up or he asks at some point, then tell him what you are doing.  

You might also want to be sure your guest room is kept open as he may come to live with you when he doesn't have any money.  Not what we like to think about, but you will likely want to help and this may be the best way.  

Your brother is an adult and can do what he wants, whether you like it or not.  Setting the example and preparing to help him when the world doesn't end is about all you can do.  Best of luck . . ."
ScottishTrader,"File an amended return as soon as possible with a check for any difference owed.  Simple and easy and no agents busting down your door for $300 . . .  Besides, they won't catch up to this for months, if not years.

Note many tax firms like H&amp;R Block will review up to 3 years of tax returns to find additional refunds for free or very low cost.  When I did this some time ago they found a bunch of deductions I didn't take so got a nice refund that more than paid for the small fee."
ScottishTrader,"Good for you to write this out and face it as reality, now you can get down to work.

The first thing to look at is selling the car and getting a beater for a couple grand, then use any left over to pay off something.  Get just the minimum insurance coverage you need for now to say some extra.

Seriously, do anything you can to pay off the IRS, they can get brutal very quickly.  If you can figure a way to pay for all your basics and put $1,000 on the IRS bill you can make some progress.  They will add in penalties and interest that will be hard to keep up with if you only pay a modest amount.  An evening job at 7/11 will bring in extra that you can plow into the tax bill. 

If you can pull together enough resources to make an offer the IRS may settle for a lesser amount.  Candidly it won’t hurt to ask.  I would not recommend using one of the services that promises to work with the IRS for you as you can do it yourself. Best of luck."
ScottishTrader,"Refinancing is the way to go, you should join a good credit union as they will often make it easier as a member than a bank.

Something that may be best is to line up another car to buy (with sensible rates) and then sell this car to pay off the loan and get out from under.  May not be the easiest, but if you can make it happen then do it.

Car dealers will make great deals and you should be able to get into a better car for less money.  Be sure you are getting a more attractive rate and you may be able to trade the car in as well in the deal.  Best of luck!"
MwM1220,"Honestly I don’t know - I haven’t been in that situation myself but I would imagine it would need to be mailed. You may want to check our r/DaveRamsey bc debt payment is sort of their thing and a lot of people have been in that situation before. They may also be able to give you a good idea on how likely you will be to negotiate down and at what price.

Good luck! I’m glad you’ve got a great paying job - that will help you cash flow through the rest of this quickly."
MwM1220,"Their job is to intimidate you. The interest does NOT stop and they are also going to ask you to pay tons and tons in collection fees. 

What I would do is call up one of the smaller loans. Tell them you have lots of outstanding debts and you’re working to get them cleaned up but right now all you have is $500. If they will put IN WRITING that the debt will be paid in full for $500, then I would send them a money order and close the account. DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES GIVE THEM ACCESS TO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT. If they refuse say okay this is all I have so I will call the next person on my list and hang up.

How are you paying for school? You also need to stop increasing your debt. I’d recommend picking up side jobs, selling things, whatever you can to try and brush up more cash. If you can get the two little ones settled for $400 or $500 each, then leave the rest of the savings as an emergency fund and get started building up cash to pay off the others."
MwM1220,"Are the referrals your own or are they being funneled to you through the practice? I’m a therapist as well and I’m assuming from your post that you’re in the licensing stage where you have to be billing under someone else, yes? At least for where I live this is a VERY unorthodox way of paying counselors. Most practices either operate with a shared overhead pay-in or a straight fee split. Usually for APCs or whatever your state calls the associates license it is a fee split and I would encourage you to evaluate what you “get” for your split. For example, 50/50 split on fees is not great where I live BUT when I was right out of school the practice I worked at got me FULL quickly with business, did all the marketing, intake, and paid all the systems. 

If I were you I would pull up your total number of sessions and see what you’re making on average per session month to month. I would anticipate if you’re doing your own intake and marketing you’d want a split of at least 70% but you may be comfortable with lower for a good referral network. I would personally seek to clarify the pay structure to make it cleaner and more transparent. It seems intentionally messy, compared to the way the field is mostly structured.

Also- are you a W2 or 1099? That also could be affecting how things show up on your paystub"
MwM1220,Gotcha- well I can’t comment I guess on what’s standard in your country but if I had a $150 bill rate and was making $30 a session I’d think you have more bargaining power than they do if you’re bringing in and retaining clients. Good luck!
MwM1220,I highly recommend YNAB. To me it is by far the most intuitive budget there is - the software is excellent and you can get a 4month free trial right now. They also have excellent videos and how-tos to get started
MwM1220,"For what it’s worth- I’m 6.5 months pregnant but do not have kids yet but husband and I have been having this very debate lately. Obviously we have some time before the little one will be doing chores seeing as she is currently in utero but since finances is a major nerdy conversation in our house and I am a behavioral therapist, it comes up in our greater philosophies on parenting. 

Basically, we are planning to have basic chores that are considered part of “being in the family” these will change based on kiddos age but likely will have some variation of helping with dinner clean up/dishes, keeping room clean, making bed (??? Maybe I will have to confront some hypocrisy here first), caring for pets, etc... these things don’t come with incentives but may come with negative reinforcements or punishments if avoided.

Aside from that, there will be a whole host of other ways our kids can earn money/commissions/allowances. Yard work, home projects, extra assistance, vacuuming the car, washing dog etc... at my husbands house growing up his dad would post weekly or monthly projects with prices and the kids could claim them in exchange for the price. These are optional, but no money will likely flow to our kids without exchanging it for work of some kind. There won’t be any shaming for these things if they opt out, but there also won’t be any money.

Last- we are planning to have some sort of “investment withdrawal” situation. Still working out what this might look like, but loosely wanting our kids to be required to save 10% or so of any and all income (possibly including birthday/gift money?) off the top into an UTMA. Also playing around with the idea of incentivizing giving and charity work. 

Not sure if this was helpful - currently in pregnancy-induced insomnia posting and not interested in proofing."
MwM1220,Great point! When they’re younger we will probably try and connect it to places we will volunteer in person as well so they can build more of that connection and then as they get older they can likely be more abstract about it
MwM1220,"I’m not sure how many programs she has available to her, but I paid cash for my masters bc if the following:

- specifically chose a program designed for working adults so that I could work during the day and kept a full time job 

- added an extra semester or two so that I could pay for my tuition as I went instead of loading my course work.  Sure, I spent about 8 extra months in school but I also shortened the amount of time I’d be paying for it by about 3 years probably. 

- when I got to the residency/internship portion of my program (of course not all programs will have this), I was able to approach my previous company with a part-time but commissions only position that allowed me to maintain close to my old income with more risk but also more scheduling flexibility. I get that this is a unique situation but I say it only to say that sometimes there are opportunities out there that may not look like your traditional work environment that can keep you working and maintaining your academic responsibilities

- Last- I worked my TAIL off for about 3 years and that was only personally possible bc my why was huge for me- my masters was going to give me the opportunity to swap to a career that I was passionate about and also gave me tremendous flexibility to become a working mom that also got lots of time with her kids. Now I’m about 2 years out from my masters and I’m 6 months pregnant with my first. As a therapist, I totally set me own hours and my own volume of work - when this kid comes I can decide how and when I work and within a field I love that doesn’t feel like work. If I didn’t have a clear vision of “why” I never would have put up with all the crap. 

Overall, I was accepted into more “prestigious” programs but I opted for financial stability. Likely she will need to make similar trade offs and decide what’s worth it in her field. Just help her align her priorities and set a path that helps her meet then In the most effective away possible."
MwM1220,"Okay. What are the interest rates on your loans? My gut is saying you’re going to want to pay off the $600+ cash advance loan today in full bc those have predatory rates attached. 

You can negotiate some old debt - when was the last time you made payments on each of them and what’s the rate on each loan?

You can get out of this!"
MwM1220,"I love my pet insurance through PetPlan. I got it years ago when my cat had a urinary blockage that cost $1400 and I was 22 and broke and I felt like the worst person that I was debating not being able to save him. I scrounged together the cash and decided to start budgeting the $20ish a month for his insurance. Since then I have added two dogs and they’re each between 30-40/month.

3 years ago the same cat broke his leg. He had a $3500 surgery to repair it and I paid a $200 deductible. Then, two week into healing the little asshole bent the plate they put in his leg and they had to do another $3500 surgery to remove his leg. For that one I paid $0 since it was part of the same claim. All in all, the situation was super stressful but would have been TERRIBLE if it also came with trying to budget a $7k bill for a surgery that would end up giving our car a totally wonderful, long life thereafter. He does great as a tripod now. 

So now, I honestly hope it ends up becoming a stupid reason to spend money for us one day but I’m certainly glad we have it. If you can self insure through $4-10k in vet bills then it is not worth it. But if you can’t, it sure is nice to know you can base your pets medical decisions on whether the treatment will save them/help them/improve their quality of life - not how much it will cost"
MwM1220,"The monthly costs are really manageable but having been 22 and sobbing on the floor of a vets office bc my pet needed a simple, 100% effective surgery that would save his life that also cost $1800 I can tell you that it’s not just about the monthly expenses. I did scrounge up the money, but since then I’ve personally invested in pet insurance since I knew I wasn’t financially able to support the crisis times. I would recommend you factor that in to your budget if you’re banking on mostly just the monthly expenses. Overall, pet insurance isn’t a “smart” financial move but if you’re choosing to care for a pet and you wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford the types of care that they sometimes come with then I recommend it bc that pup will rely on you.

Also I will add: $450 isn’t a TON of residual. You’re likely going to spend $60 or so on food a month for a lab, flea and heart worm meds around about $150 for a 6 month supply, so that’s roughly $25 a month, and then annual vet visit is around $150-200 or so depending on what shots they need etc... not to mention the other life stuff that may pop up to eat up your residual $450 (flat tires, oil changes etc...)

I’m not saying don’t do it - just think it all through."
MwM1220,Don’t refinance for a faster payoff - only refinance for a better rate and only if you’d pay back the closing cost in less than 2 years of interest savings. So basically not enough info from this to say whether you should or shouldn’t
Charles0nline,"Is it worth trading FXIAX (Fidelity 500) for FZROX (Fidelity Zero Total US Market)? I just recently started investing in a Roth IRA based on the advise I got from a post I made on this subreddit. I contributed $11500 to my Roth IRA and invested $5500 of it in FXAIX because at the time it seemed like I was seeing a lot of threads suggesting it. Now it seems like I am seeing FZROX suggested everywhere for fidelity users. Is it worth trading FXAIX for FZROX? Also, I still have $6000 that is not invested should I buy some shares of FZILX (Fidelity's Zero International Fund or something else? If it matters I just turned 24 and I use Fidelity because I have a 401k with them.

TL;DR: 24 Spent $5500 on FXAIX shares thinking it was the right choice, hearing more about FZROX wondering if I should trade. Also have $6000 that is not invested wondering if I should diversify or spend it on FZROX or keep buying FXAIX."
Charles0nline,"Haha, well when I started the day thinking I was going to have pay taxes on $20k to get out of these expensive mutual funds and now learning I don’t have to is great! I still ended up making money overall I just could of made a lot more if I was originally invested in VTSAX or a S&amp;p 500 fund. Oh well that’s what I get for listening to my parents for investment advice."
Charles0nline,That’s good to know! Thanks for the advice! Since there doesn’t seem to be a huge difference I might just wait on buying FZROX until I’m confident in its performance. Perhaps I’ll check with you in another 6months and compare the difference!
Charles0nline,"How much will it cost me in taxes to trade my mutual funds for an index fund at another company? I have 3 mutual funds in a brokerage account at Wells Fargo (PJIAX, CVGRX, BMCAX) totally ~$20,500 and it appears they are not very good. I am wondering how much I will have to pay in taxes/fees if I were sell these funds and invest in an index fund at Vanguard for example. If it is important I make ~$70k/year.

LobsterBio,"If your job offers any sort of match for the 401k you should 100% make sure to contribute enough to the plan to get the full match.

Building up an emergency fund is also a top priority.  3-6 months of expenses is a general rule of thumb, so for you about $7,800 - $15,600.

Assuming you're under 50, your contribution limit for a Roth IRA is $6,000 for 2019 and you have until April 15 of 2020 to contribute for this year.  I would set up an emergency fund in a savings account first, then contribute to the Roth.  With 2k available per month to save you'll be able to set aside 6 months in the emergency fund and still be able to max out the Roth before the deadline.  Then next year, you can max it out again without having to set up the emergency fund first :)"
bmore1182,Yeah have fun with the standard deviation on that return profile. This isnt aspirational bucket money. This is need bucket money and the confidence interval needs to be over 90% and it means he needs more capital to generate the Cash flow
bmore1182,"He clearly stated he needed 2400 to maintain his ""current monthy income"" not fund a donation to his Alma mater in 10 years or start a foundation. All I'm saying is for what he needed- which was a part of current income- anything levered or generating a wide SD of outcomes isn't a feasible solution. But given the fact his wife of 40 years isn't Sharing financial info- I'm guessing this is the least of his problems"
GMSaaron,"Paying Rent is an expense while paying mortgage  is an investment. In the end, the money you spend on rent is never coming back while the money you spend on mortgage will essentially all come back to you in the form of the property you paid off (assuming its value doesn't tank) 

The tradeoff is you need to pay a down payment to be a homeowner and generally, mortgage is more expensive than rent, meaning your quality of life will be a bit worse in the earlier years. But when you finish paying off the mortgage, you'll have a very expensive asset verses nothing if you have always been renting.

In your specific situation, it might be more worth it to continue renting and taking your time to find the best deal, or even waiting until your income goes up so you can buy a nicer place that will inflate more.

Or you can buy now and live in your bargain rent place and rent out the new place. That way, your money will be  generating money instead of sitting there waiting for a deal that may never come."
GMSaaron,"I think where you're stumped is where and how nice of a place you want to live in relative to how much you have. 

You can buy a place that is within your price range and live in it, or you can buy a nicer place as an investment, continue paying your cheap rent while renting out the nicer place. Down the road, you'll be able to live in that nicer place once you don't need that rent income. 

Yea you can invest your money in stocks and other things, that would be up to you. Personally, I think buying property is much safer than stocks. If the return on your stocks and investments outpace the inflation of the property you want to buy, then go for it. 

Real estate consistently goes up with the exception of some bad years, but the trend is always up."
GMSaaron,"Since this is a finance sub, I ran some quick numbers for you 

Assuming 261 working days a year x 2 hour commute a day = 522 hours

$15,000 / 522 hours = $28.74 an hour

If you move out for a 5-10 min commute, it means you are willing to spend $57.84 in exchange for not having to do a 2 hour commute 

Minus the cost of commuting of course

Instead of paying rent, you can afford to Uber or use whatever car service every now and then for the days you don't feel up to the commute."
GMSaaron,"If you rent, all of those expenses are trickled down to the renter anyways. Renters are still supposed to pay for the wear and tear they cause.

It depends on the difference in price if you rent verses paying mortgage. If its almost the same price (which it usually is, where I live at least), who cares how the costs are distributed, the final amount you pay is the same anyways."
GMSaaron,"Exactly, you will have much less money. Think about it, if you don't move out, you literally have spare $800 a month to do whatever with, that's a lot of random stuff you can buy for fun. 

Do what my brother does, live at home but stay outside all day and go home to sleep and eat LOL. 

Living alone is risky, especially when it comes to health insurance. God forbid you don't have a good plan and get slapped with a big health bill.

It's a tradeoff between your happiness now and your happiness in the future. Saving money can make a big difference in your life when you start investing or buying a house"
GMSaaron,"If the $1500 isn't collecting interest, you should use the money to put a bigger down payment with less monthly interest on the car. (I'm assuming a bigger down payment will lower the overall cost of the car, which it should)

Credit score matters if you're planning on making a huge purchase (like a house) in the near future, because it will affect your interest rate on that. Otherwise, it doesn't really matter as long as you're paying off your debt on time every period. 

However, if the $1500 has interest, definitely pay that off first because you wouldn't want to interest to snowball"
GMSaaron,"If you are over 24, you don't need your parents financial information to apply for student aid. 

How much you recieve will be based on your income. I don't think how much you have saved matters. After all, it's not like they can see how much money you have in your pocket."
GMSaaron,"It doesn't make sense to put a lower down payment and use the remaining to invest because with a lower down payment, you'll probably be paying higher interest, most likely higher than any return you make on investments. 

Managing risk is up to you. Do your research and consider how long you can keep yourself afloat if you lose your job. Also do your research about whether you think the housing market will go up or down, nobody truly knows, if we did, we'd all be rich. If you're too scared of the housing market going down and it'll keep you up at night when you buy a home, you might as well rent and save yourself the stress. 

Property tax is deductible to an extent. Yes owning a home comes with a lot of expenses, but paying mortgage is an investment while paying rent is an expense. When you pay off mortgage, it's one step closer to owning a home that has value while rent is money you'll never see again.

Also, if you lose your job, you can always rent out your home to pay it off and live somewhere cheaper yourself."
GMSaaron,"It depends on how much money you can save by paying cash up front verses financing. 

I'm not an expert but I know that you get tax breaks and deductions when you're paying off a house, and I know that some people like deliberately refinance their mortgage for the tax breaks. So maybe consider that as well."
GMSaaron,"With that income, I'm sure you're able to move out at 800 a month, that translates to 9,600 a year. I live in NYC too and there are places you can rent for $500 a month 

You still have ~20k, food should be like, $3-500 a month depending on the quality of food you want. Phone, maybe $30-40 a month. Subway like ~100 a month. 

You have enough to move out. What you should consider is that rent is an expense. If you continue to live at your parents, you essentially save $800 a month. But I understand that that may suck so I would say just think about it. 

Save $9,600 a year for a couple years and you'll be able to put down on a house. Then you can pay mortgage instead of renting."
GMSaaron,"It is completely up to the landlord how much they care about your credit score, not every renter cares or even asks for it. Also, if your s.o's name is on the lease, she would basically be vouching for you with her credit too"
GMSaaron,"It's not a terrible idea to buy a $3-400k house with a combined income of 110k. Theoretically, you can put down ~10-20% and pay mortgage for the rest of the home. if you can't make payments in the future for whatever reason, you can always rent out a room to help you out. Worst case scenario, you can rent a cheaper place for yourselves and rent out your own house to pay off the mortgage.

Do the math, see how much monthly mortgage you're able to pay and how long you can keep up payments for just in case you face a financial setback."
GMSaaron,"Oof that's tough. 

Yea maybe move out and consistently try to make more money.  

A lot of your problems can be solved if you found a girlfriend that would split the rent with you and share a room. Maybe something to aspire to"
GMSaaron,"No reason to get a loan of you can afford it. 

Plus, you can probably negotiate for a cash upfront discount too.

The only reason I can think of where a loan where will better is if you can somehow invest your cash and make more from it than how much the interest on the loan will be. But that's doubtful"
chilli1989,"Do you have any credit or debit cards? What country are you travelling from?

You want to have some cash with you, but not much. Certainly not enough to last you a whole week. 

Ireland isn't a hard place to travel around. Credit cards are widely accepted and ATM's are easy to find in most towns and cities."
chilli1989,"8% of that salary wouldn't ""max out"" your 401k. The max contribution for 2019 will be $19k. Regardless, you should absolutely contribute up to your employer's match. If you don't, you're leaving money on the table.

Beyond that 8%, it's a personal choice. Some employer 401ks offer absolutely abysmal options, so putting additional contributions in an IRA may be a smarter choice.

To really look at the cost/benefit of saving for a down payment vs contributing to retirement, you need to look at your current cost of living, your age, salary expectations over the next few years, expected rate of savings, likelihood of rent increases, the housing market, etc. It's a very individual decision that we can't really give much input on without significantly more info."
chilli1989,"How much is the CC debt and at what interest rate? That’s really a big part of the equation here. If you have a large debt at the interest rates CCs tend to have, I wouldn’t personally choose a new car over paying that off aggressively. 

Also, why do you need a minivan? What does it offer over a smaller, more economical vehicle? What is wrong with your current vehicle beyond age?"
chilli1989,"Houses aren't just a mortgage payment, insurance, and taxes. You don't have enough cushion in your budget to make this work.

Even on a ""renovated"" place maintenance/repair costs often completely blindside people. With just $600 left over each month, a single visit from a plumber to fix an overflowing toilet could wipe out your whole month's savings. Appliances die, faucets leak, window panes break, trees need to be trimmed, furnaces need to be serviced... renovated doesn't mean maintenance free by any means.

Don't forget that there will also be closing costs, new locks for the doors, furniture, cookware, tools, and all the other miscellaneous stuff you likely don't own if you rent. I swear I lived at Home Depot the first month I owned a home. Those little $5 purchases add up fast.

Either buy a significantly less expensive house or find a way to increase your salary."
chilli1989,"Those costs don’t trickle down to the renter directly. The landlord likely saves up over multiple years, multiple apartments, and multiple tenants to afford maintenance costs on a building.

If the roof goes at my house, that’s $20k out of my pocket. If the roof goes at a rental, the tenant won’t see a single bill for it. 

Maintenance costs are not cheap. People get in way over their heads jumping into home ownership thinking it’s an “investment” and that a mortgage of $1000 is the same as $1000 in rent."
chilli1989,"How did you end up with a $650 payment and a 72 month term on a used Honda CRV? What was the price, interest rate, down payment, and trade in value?

Selling it and leasing doesn't make any financial sense. Just keep what you have, take good care of it, and drive it into the ground."
chilli1989,"Yes, this is normal. Many employers offer less than great options.

If you have a 401k match from your company, contribute up to that amount so you aren't leaving money on the table. If you want to make further contributions to your retirement savings (which you should), open an IRA where you can allocate your funds however you would like."
chilli1989,"Send them a nicely worded email asking to break the lease. 

Many landlords will work something out with you. It’s easier for them to let you out of it than force you into it and hound you for rent. 

At least in my area, the most common way this is structured is they let you out of the lease with a minimum 30 days notice and a half months rent as a fee."
chilli1989,"He has $45k saved, a salaried position, and seems to live in a low COL area. The down payment would be $10k-$14k, which doesn’t wipe out his savings by any means. 

His parents have every right to suggest he move out at this point, and his father’s advice to buy a home doesn’t seem all that out of line given the stated housing cost, savings, and salary."
chilli1989,"You cannot afford to move out, especially in NYC.

Work on your relationship with your aunt. Setting boundaries and standards for privacy is healthy. As a 26 year old adult, this is a conversation you'll need to learn to have, since it's almost guaranteed to come up with roommates. Sit down with your aunt, tell her how much you appreciate her letting you live with her at such a discount, and suggest setting up a schedule for you to contribute the help she needs. Be polite, explain that you need some privacy, and come to an amicable compromise. 

As far as the financials, try for that promotion or get a better/full-time job. Save up, pay off your debts fully, and then consider moving out."
chilli1989,"What kind of Jeep exactly?

Wranglers and Rubicons sell very, very well as a private party used vehicle, generally for much more than $2k.

Even if it's not that kind of Jeep (maybe it's a laredo, cherokee, etc), you can almost certainly get a good bit more selling it yourself on Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace. It can be a hassle, but it's worth it for the extra cash.

As far as paying off debt vs buying a car, we'd need to know your income, expenses, savings, interest rate and balance on the CC debt, and the price of the car your looking at to get a rough idea of your situation. That said, if you have disposable income monthly, why aren't you using that to further pay down the CC debt right now?"
chilli1989,"Yes.

That said, look at your entire financial picture and make sure all high interest debt is paid off, you have a sufficient emergency fund, and you are on track for other financial goals (such as buying a home).

Additionally, you can try petitioning your company for better 401k options."
chilli1989,"I felt this way for a long time, and often still go through periods of feeling like what I'm doing isn't ""enough"". Financial independence and security are massively important to me and occasionally meeting my own expectations can feel pretty overwhelming. I'm 28, so not all that much older than you.

So, here's how I've personally handled it:

1. Work out a monthly budget for the things you absolutely have to pay for (rent, utilities, student loans, train fare, etc). 
2. Consciously think about extraneous purchases. Do you really need a third pair of sneakers, or a vehicle upgrade, or new towels? Keep frivolous spending to a minimum, but don't be so frugal you don't enjoy your life. I keep a list of items I want and periodically review it. If an item is on the list for a few months, I have the money, and I still want it, then I buy it. This habit has helped me cut back on impulse purchases significantly.
3. Set up automatic transfers to a savings account and a retirement account from each paycheck. It's easier not to spend it if you never even see it in your main account. 
4. Set small goals, intermediate goals, and long terms goals. For me this was paying off my car loan, having 6 months of emergency funding in a savings account, and buying a home. Once you reach them, set new goals. Checking goals off a list helps me see the progress and de-stress about everything a bit. 
5. Learn about investing. Knowledge is power. Read books, ask friends in finance, ask family about their financial habits. Don't avoid investing because it makes you nervous, but also don't go into it blindly.
6. Review your budget annually or anytime there's a big change (moving, raise, loan paid off, etc).

&amp;#x200B;

Comparisons can be dangerous, but I feel pretty confident saying you're doing better than many people your age. The number of people I know who are in their 20's and even 30's who don't save, don't plan, and don't seem to care at all is astounding. Financial planning and real ""adulthood"" can hit you like a ton of bricks in your early 20's. You'll adjust to it."
chilli1989,"Travelers checks aren't widely used anymore, but they'd work pretty well for your situation. The exchange rate might not be the best and there can be some fees depending on your bank, but they can be convenient and they might give you a little more peace of mind than travelling with a large sum of cash.

Alternatively, ask your wedding planner if any of the merchants would be willing to accept a digital payment. Paypal, zelle, venmo, etc. It doesn't hurt to ask."
chilli1989,"Coworker’s compensation doesn’t really factor into your actual wage discussion with your employer. That said, it’s a good data point. It shows that they likely have deep enough pockets to offer you a larger salary and they know market rates for your position. 

Do some market research and find out what you’re actually worth. Then compile a list of what you’ve accomplished this year, how you’ve grown as an employee, and how you’ve become more of an asset to the company.

Present the above findings at your annual review in a clear and concise manner. Asking for pay that’s in line with the market and your current work load is perfectly reasonable. Complaining that the new guy makes too much and is lazy and they should pay you more will not go well."
chilli1989,"This is an incredibly irresponsible decision.

Buy a car that fits your income and lifestyle. You don't have to drive a mid 00's Camry, there's a whole heck of a lot of options between that and a brand new Tesla."
chilli1989,"Did they give you a reason? I've rarely seen this happen if the unit isn't hard to fill. 

Also, you can try just offering them a sum, like half a month's rent. 

Beyond that, open a credit card with no interest for the first year. Then use it to pay your upfront costs and pay it off before you owe interest."
chilli1989,"With a $70k salary, no debt, a good credit score, and only two late payments on credit cards from a few years ago, I doubt you'll have issue at all getting approved for $150k.

They'll want to know what you're planning on doing for a down payment and if there are any HOA fees (as though can sometimes be quite expensive).

Rates will depend on the actual amount you finance, your credit, and the term of the loan. For a 30 year, I'd expect somewhere between 4 and 4.75. Shop around, the rates really can change a good bit between lenders. Make sure you also look at the fine print and are really comparing apples to apples."
Rickn99,"Was coming to ask this.  The one  time I got a similar letter it was due to the IRS not knowing how much I paid for the stock. They assumed I got it for free, so the sale was all profit and wanted to tax me on the entire amount. 

It was an easy fix."
